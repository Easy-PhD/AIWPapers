  abstract     = {With the growing demand for underwater recognition systems, underwater visual object tracking has recently received wide attention. The visible light scene analysis in a liquid environment poses specific challenges for underwater visual object tracking, such as impairment of sharpness, blue tinge, and illumination refraction. These problems lead to a performance degradation of the conventional visual object tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose to adapt the methodology for underwater tracking by performing a long-term template refinement to achieve fine-grained spatial template matching and long-range temporal dependency for use with a Siamese tracking network. The template refinement is based on an attention mechanism, which is designed to highlight the saliency and discriminatory information of the tracked content. This mechanism obtains an accurate target mask for the template and alleviates the impact of the underwater noise in the template feature embedding. The long-term template generator updates the dynamic appearance of the target adaptively by clustering historical templates using a Gaussian Mixture Model. This approach enhances the target representation capacity and alleviates challenges such as visual obstructions, complex background variations and prevalent noise in underwater environment. The experimental results obtained on the challenging underwater tracking dataset, UOT32, demonstrate the advantage of the proposed long-term template refinement tracker. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as SiamMask by 5.03% in Distance Precision and 2.31% in Overlap Success, which provides a promising visual perception technology for underwater artificial intelligence systems. On the standard tracking benchmarking dataset VOT2018, the proposed method is 5.56% higher than SiamRPN++ on the Expected Average Overlap and demonstrates comparable performance, verifying its generalisation capacity in other tracking scenarios and environments.},

  abstract     = {A metasurface including an empty region constituted by a square-shaped aperture is proposed to improve the performance of a circularly polarized patch antenna array based on sequential-phase feeding. The metasurface is applied/stacked to a conventional antenna consisting of a loop feeding structure, which enables sequential incremental phase to four patches. Surface waves propagating on the metasurface are excited, affecting the resonance features of the overall radiating structure, thereby improving both the input impedance-matching and the axial ratio bandwidths of the antenna. The square-shaped aperture in the top layer is introduced to extend the range of frequency over which the sequential phase feeding remains effective. The antenna prototype and the stacked metasurface are fabricated. The experimental results, in good agreement with simulation, show that the antenna with the compact size 2.16 λ0 × 2.16 λ0 × 0.12 λ0, at the central frequency, provides a broad impedance relative bandwidth of 43.8% from 11.6 GHz to 18.1 GHz and a 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 36.6% (from 11.6 GHz to 16.8 GHz). In addition, the proposed antenna has a flat gain within the operating frequency band and a peak gain G=13.9 dBic at frequency f=14 GHz.},

  abstract     = {The exceptional properties of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), including their small construction, high power-torque density, and high efficiency, make them one of the most popular electrical machines. However, the motor structure needs to be optimized for circumstances like boosting the PMSM’s energy efficiency, optimizing output power, and lowering motor weight and cogging torque. This research aims to identify the optimal values for the parameters essential to achieving the most efficient design of a 15 kW PMSM. For this purpose, a new optimization algorithm is proposed. This proposed algorithm is an application of the fuzzy logic-based fitness distance balance design to the gradient-based optimization algorithm (GBO). The developed algorithm is called fuzzy Fitness Distance Balance Gradient-Based Optimization (fFDBGBO) algorithm. The proposed algorithm and various optimization algorithms with effective results in the literature were tested for the fitness function determined to find the optimal values of Embrace, Offset, Skew Width, Magnet Thickness, and slot bottom width (Bs1) of PMSM. The results indicate that the suggested algorithm achieves better performance than rival algorithms in terms of effectiveness. Compared to the GBO algorithm, the proposed fFDBGBO method achieves a 0.2979% increase in efficiency. Compared to other algorithms, the suggested algorithm’s objective function has the highest slot fill factor (49.9995%), yet it still complies with the specified limit value. Relative to the initial design, the motor efficiency achieved with the fFDBGBO algorithm improved from 91.7788% to 93.0366%, while the magnet weight decreased from 2.14837 to 2.09475, and the total motor weight remained approximately the same as 53.2286 kg and 54.0436 kg.},

  abstract     = {During semiconductor manufacturing, wafer defect patterns emerge in an uncontrolled environment, making immediate recognition challenging. To enhance the classification accuracy in pattern recognition, deep learning (DL) techniques are employed to address the issue of defective pattern identification. The inherent differences among various wafer defect types lead to imbalanced testing datasets, thereby reducing the efficiency of classification models in delivering accurate predictions. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a data transformation method at the feature extraction stage, incorporating Density-based features and Radon-based features to enhance the representation of key patterns. Subsequently, multiple classifiers are integrated using voting, bagging, and AdaBoost strategies to improve classification performance and model generalization. The primary objective is to mitigate data imbalance and selection bias by employing random sampling and assigning distinct weights to individual classifiers. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, we introduce a novel feature extraction strategy that leverages Features extracted by the CNN model, Density-based features and Radon-based features, effectively capturing structural and spatial characteristics in wafer defect patterns. Second, we propose an ensemble learning framework integrating multiple classifiers with optimized weighting mechanisms to enhance classification robustness. Third, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating that our weighted soft voting approach achieves superior performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 95.09% and an F1 score of 0.95. These results validate the effectiveness of our method in improving the reliability of wafer defect classification, which is crucial for advancing automated defect inspection in semiconductor manufacturing.},

A comprehensive evaluation on in-vitro and in-vivo data using U-Net and GoogLeNet-based beamformers demonstrated over a 50% reduction in computational complexity while preserving the original image quality. The implementation of the proposed methodology on the Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA achieved latency improvement of over 45% and 46% for the U-Net and GoogLeNet models, respectively. Additionally, when compared to state-of-the-art filter pruning approaches, including magnitude-based and feature map-based filter pruning, the proposed methodology outperformed both in terms of computational reduction and output image quality, achieving over a 14% improvement on the Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA.},

Operational models, which are a type of SysML activity diagram, can be used to depict these scenarios using model-based systems engineering techniques. Although it aids communication between engineers and stakeholders, the activity diagram can grow rapidly as development progresses. Owing to the extensive operational model, it is challenging to review the activity diagram, which can result in serious issues. Therefore, to make the operational models easier to evaluate, they must be concise. This study presents a metamodel that offers stereotypes that can successfully characterize spacecraft operational scenarios. First, the domain knowledge of spacecraft operations was visualized using a tree structure to organize common knowledge. Second, a stereotype metamodel was created by extracting common behaviors from common knowledge. Utilizing stereotypes can decrease the size of operational models; however, crucial review-related data can be lost. Therefore, tagged values ensure that crucial information is not lost. Several trials were conducted and showed that the number of elements of operational models with stereotypes, as well as their size, was reduced by almost half compared with the original models, allowing for a simplified review process and boosting trust in the accuracy of the operational scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has recently gained significant attention due to its potential to detect objects of novel classes with only a few annotated examples. Existing FSOD methods rely largely on visual features extracted from limited support images of novel classes, which are highly sensitive to background noise, pose variations, and intra-class diversity, thereby limiting generalization performance on object detection for the novel classes. To address these challenges, we propose a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text-guided FSOD framework, denoted as CT-FSOD, that leverages a CLIP-based vision-language pretraining model to enhance class prototypes (class representative vectors) learning and representation alignment between support and query images. Our framework consists of two core branches: (i) Prototype Distillation Branch that extracts semantically aligned features from support images using a frozen CLIP image encoder, producing robust and semantics-aware prototypes; (ii) Text Matching Branch that generates initial prototypes for novel classes using CLIP text features constructed through CoOp-style learnable context tokens, providing pose-invariant and semantically consistent anchors. During training, query image features from a trainable CNN backbone are doubly aligned with CLIP-derived rich and semantic (i) image features via the Prototype Distillation Module and (ii) text features via the CLIP Alignment Loss. These alignments encourage meaningful and generalizable discriminative feature learning, thus significantly improving object detection performance for novel classes under few-shot conditions. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our CT-FSOD achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for FSOD.},

However, many studies still prefer highly controlled setups and passive stimulation, often due to the practical complexities in effectively associating cause (stimulus) to response in highly interactive and dynamic VR experiences. Many of these studies also rely on subjective ratings from participants recorded either after the experience (relying on memory) or during the experience (interrupting immersion). In this paper, we advance this experimental protocol in a large-scale feasibility study by (1) investigating affective changes in terms of valence and arousal ratings in various interactive 3D room-scale VR environments with (2) continuous valence and arousal self-ratings from a controller and (3) a novel wireless physiological facial EMG and PPG sensor setup specifically designed to record affect, without relying on memory or interrupting immersion. In this study, n=291 participants experienced neutral, positive and negative virtual environments in ’passive’ and ’active’ conditions. Continuous self-ratings and physiological measures confirmed the feasibility of detecting affective states in room-scale VR conditions. To our knowledge, this is the highest n in a feasibility study in affect detection to date. Our study generated the most populated physiological data library collected in VR, which also compares passive and active VR settings.

Each laboratory’s objectives are encoded into a 130 × 17 binary matrix, enabling large-scale quantitative analysis. Spearman correlation analysis, corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) method, reveals statistically significant co-occurrence trends. Key findings include the synergy between artificial intelligence and cognition, a hardware–software divide, and underexplored intersections between AI and physical system innovation. In addition to correlation heatmaps, visualizations such as PCA biplots and radial similarity networks reveal research gaps and collaboration opportunities. These insights can guide agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions in shaping future robotics research.

  abstract     = {A photonic system including the power-over-fiber powering of a silicon-on-insulator 1×2 thermo-optic switch based on a Mach-Zehnder structure was designed, and a prototype was developed and tested. The power section consists of an integrated photovoltaic cell, a dc-dc power converter and a NiMH battery. A standard communication fiber transmits light from a single-wavelength power laser to a fiber-pigtailed power converter photodiode, which is operated near its maximum power point through a dc-dc power converter. The converter stage was designed to set the output voltage to a level suitable for charging a battery and actuating the heater of the thermo-optic switch under test. The correct operation of the system is demonstrated. The results could be of interest for developing optical circuits capable of establishing reconfigurable optical paths among users in non-electrified optical networks.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies have experienced a significant increase in popularity due to their potential to deliver a highly immersive user experience. However, there are still substantial difficulties in creating augmented environments with different purposes that can precisely localize users. In this context, TeachAR is an augmented reality solution designed to provide students with an interactive learning experience through an augmented reality quest system. The system comprises a desktop application and a mobile application, designed for three distinct user roles: building administrators, teachers, and students. Administrators use the desktop application to upload the building’s architectural plans, create a 3D replica of it, and define a navigation graph. Then, using the mobile application, the correspondence between the real building and its replica is created. Teachers employ a simple desktop user interface to design interactive quests. Students interact with the system through the mobile application in three different use cases: free exploration of the building, guided navigation to reach a destination, and individual or collaborative quests proposed by teachers. This paper provides a brief overview of the system’s main functionalities, implementation details, and evaluation of its technical capabilities. The pilot testing is also described in this paper, revealing the potential of using the TeachAR system in schools in the educational process.},

We present S²-Code, a self-synchronizing symmetric protocol that couples a dual-window state machine with an AEAD-protected bidirectional token. We derive practical window-sizing bounds from packet loss/reordering, request rate, and offline duration, and validate the design via symbolic verification in ProVerif, network emulation in Mininet, and hardware experiments on Raspberry Pi and ESP32-C3. S²-Code achieves 100% session recovery after a catastrophic 50-count desynchronization where rolling codes fail. Under 30% packet loss, it sustains 60% success versus 20% for the rolling-code baseline (p < 10⁻⁸). A layered DoS defense—kernel-level rate limiting (nftables) plus an adaptive protocol mechanism—raises legitimate success from ≈17% under flooding to ≈92.9% under protocol-aware attack. The protocol has a small footprint (<8 KB flash, <4 KB RAM), low overhead (≈114-byte packets, <17 ms latency), and scales to 100 concurrent devices in emulation. S²-Code offers a practical, robust middle ground between fragile rolling codes and heavyweight PKI for resource-constrained IoT.},

  abstract     = {Polyhedral tiled computing arrays (PTCAs) are a largely unexplored paradigm in which the assembly of high performance computing (HPC) structures may be achieved by the multidimensional tiling of particular polyhedral modules, each housing computing devices. Typically, PTCAs form physical three dimensional (3D) topologies which readily support logical three dimensional topologies. PTCAs eliminate the need for traditional backplanes, racks and custom host circuit-board modules, while inherently composing coherent and scalable input/output (IO), power and cooling grids simply by abutting to neighboring modules in one or more dimensions. This highly novel concept offers unique possibilities in all three of those domains, and therefore quantifying PTCA capabilities and limitations is critical in establishing the desirability of such systems for future modular and heterogeneous HPC systems. The questions must then arise: is this a realistic paradigm?, and, can such a system be practically engineered? In this paper we contribute a number of insights, an analytical methodology for the evaluation of a specific class of PTCAs, based upon simple-cube and truncated octahedral modules arranged into cubic arrays, and we demonstrate the use of numerical methods and formulae to analyze the potential capabilities and limits of such novel systems with both existing reference points and future technology expectations. Whilst mapping out all aspects of this novel design-space is somewhat speculative, and beyond the scope of a single paper, we do conclude by identifying key challenges and ’road-map’ goals aimed toward finally reaching that objective.},

It helps the super market to increase their sales based on the model components such as seasonality, impact of holidays and weather. This time series analysis helps the inventory management to analyze the trends, which in return helps the super market to get optimal stock and to have minimal loss. In existing approaches, time series analysis is performed using the pure statistical and anomaly detection approaches but statistical approaches assume the linear relation between the features due to which the model cannot extract the complex patterns. Without extracting the complex patterns, the parallel processing becomes difficult and also customer segmentation becomes difficult. In this research, the model fine tunes the prophet, gradient boost regressor and ensembles them to forecast the sales on daily basis. Boosting regressor can efficiently extract the relation between both internal and external factors to understand the complex patterns and trends on timely basis. Boosting algorithm has the capability to perform data analysis and feature engineering simultaneously. While capturing the patterns, the model needs long term analysis because of seasonal changes, festival offers, weather impacts and other parameters, these are analyzed by the prophet model along with shifts in the trends and component analysis. By combining XGBoost Regressor and Prophet for retail sales forecasting, model gain the ability to model both time-dependent patterns (seasonality, trends, holiday effects) and non-linear relationships (promotions, pricing, external factors), leading to improved forecast accuracy, robustness to real-world data challenges, and better decision-making capabilities in retail environments.},

This study proposes using pretrained multimodal Large/Small Language Models (LLM/SLM), specifically GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5-Flash, for concrete defect detection without additional fine-tuning. Structured prompts (S-Prompt) were employed to direct the task instructions and to elicit structured JSON outputs. The models’ performances were evaluated in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, the latter including visual examples. Performance was benchmarked against a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model, employing standard detection metrics alongside newly introduced metrics: Class Presence Accuracy (CPA), Relaxed Localization Recall (RLR), and Unmatched Prediction Rate (UPR). Experimental results demonstrated that even in a zero-shot setting, the LLM/SLM models meaningfully identified defect presence, type, and approximate location (at an IoU threshold of 0.1) (GPT-4o: F1@0.1=0.487, CPA-F1=0.667). The few-shot scenario improved certain metrics (F1@0.1, CPA-F1, RLR@0.1, etc.) but exhibited trade-offs including increased UPR and reduced inference speed. Although the proposed method showed lower performance than YOLOv8 in precise localization tasks (higher IoU thresholds), it demonstrated significant potential as a training-free pipeline suitable for initial screening purposes without the burden of extensive data labeling and retraining.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an accurate and efficient approach to fitness activity recognition by combining inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data with deep learning techniques. We propose a novel architecture, 1D-CNN-ResBiGRU, which integrates one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with residual bidirectional gated recurrent units (ResBiGRUs) for temporal sequence modeling, enabling precise classification of diverse fitness activities. The ResBiGRU introduces residual connections within the bidirectional gated recurrent units, not just between layers. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated using the publicly available Running Exercise dataset, which comprises IMU recordings from 20 participants performing seven distinct running exercises. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent mobile fitness applications that provide personalized, responsive exercise feedback and performance monitoring.},

This paper presents a fine-tuning approach for adapting 7-billion-parameter instructed LLMs (Llama-3v and Mistral) to SatCom, using a proprietary corpus sourced from the European Space Agency (ESA) consisting of domain-specific PDF documents. The confidential nature of this corpus imposes constraints on both model training and evaluation, demanding a sensible text extraction pipeline capable of handling complex structures, such as tables, to preserve critical information. Our fine-tuning methodology employs a carefully configured process, followed by an automatic evaluation framework using a curated Q&A set tailored to SatCom. Models were created in both non-quantified and 8-bit quantized formats, ensuring feasibility for desktop-level inference. The fine-tuned models demonstrated a 6,6% improvement over the baseline LLM, as well as significant gains when compared to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. These results indicate a promising advancement in the development of LLMs for domain-specific applications within the SatCom field.},

This study introduces the concept of a minimal coalition of influencers capable of efficiently promoting a sustainability message to the public. To address this, we propose a novel framework for Approximate Relational Games (ARG), which quantifies the degree of dependency of a follower on an influencer through a Dependency Decision Table (DDT). The DDT tracks follower reactions, categorized as “Like only” or “Like and Share”, across a series of posts by the influencer. By setting a threshold for the degree of dependency, we focus on followers with stronger relational dependencies, eliminating those with weaker associations. This method enables the identification of a minimal winning coalition of influencers who can effectively disseminate the sustainability message despite resource constraints, both financial and non-financial. Utilizing combinatorial tools such as closure operators and choice functions, we present a method for determining minimal winning coalitions with polynomial time complexity. This approach offers a cost-effective solution for green organizations and governments aiming to maximize the impact of their campaigns. To validate the proposed model and algorithms, we conduct Python-based simulations using data from five real-world Facebook influencers, both macro and micro-tier, complemented by manual calculations. The results demonstrate the efficacy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in optimizing influencer marketing strategies for promoting environmental sustainability.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an interpretable and scalable graph-based system designed to predict biases in instructional achievement across diverse educational data. Aimed at large-scale learning platforms, the system identifies distinctive patterns of instructor-related biases by learning hierarchical features from a wide range of behaviorsąłincluding teaching styles, student interactions, and prior performanceąłusing weakly supervised methods to capture broad influencing factors. To refine these inputs, we apply a geometric feature selection process that removes less informative attributes, improving the quality of instructor and student representations. These refined features are embedded into a latent space where each instructor is characterized by a set of underlying bias-related behaviors. This facilitates a more nuanced understanding of disparities in achievement. Using these representations, we build a weighted similarity graph of instructors, connecting them based on shared bias-related patterns. Advanced clustering algorithms detect meaningful communities within this graph, grouping instructors who exhibit similar instructional biasesąłsuch as preferences for certain teaching methods or styles of student engagement. These communities reveal bias patterns at both broad and detailed levels within teaching environments. To enhance interpretability, the system links these community results with individual instructor profiles, offering personalized insights about instructional biases. By combining local instructional behaviors with broader educational trends, the system improves its ability to predict and address achievement disparities. We tested this approach on datasets containing millions of student and instructor interactions. The results demonstrate that the system scales efficiently and maintains high accuracy across different teaching contexts and instructor activity levels. Its ability to uncover hidden instructional biases and provide actionable feedback makes it a valuable tool for promoting fairness in education.},

To overcome the instability of empirical distributions, EMUAD is extended into a distributionally robust optimization portfolio problem (DR-EMUAD), which constructs a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered on the empirical distribution using the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, by applying suitable approximation methods, we obtained a convex version of DR-EUMAD. The Robust Wasserstein Profile Inference (RWPI) method is utilized to effectively determine the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity set. To ensure practical applicability, we embed a comprehensive set of real-world constraints—industry exposure limits, position size bounds, an explicit turnover cap, and a liquidity-driven transaction-cost budget. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both EMUAD and DR-EMUAD outperform traditional portfolio problems, with DR-EMUAD particularly effective at controlling return volatility, significantly enhancing robustness and practical utility in investment decision-making.},

  abstract     = {The swift advancement of UAV technology is accelerating the intelligent transformation of object detection methods. UAV applications now span both civilian and military sectors, playing a crucial role in scenarios such as aerial surveying, disaster response, and security monitoring. However, UAV image detection faces numerous challenges: targets are affected by flight altitude and viewing angle, leading to significant scale variations; dynamic flight results in constantly changing spatial layouts and complex backgrounds—such as dense vegetation and building textures—often weaken or obscure object features, making detection more difficult. To tackle these issues, we present a novel YOLOv8-based model tailored for small object detection in UAV images. In response to the prevalence of small targets in UAV images, the model enhances the multi-scale network structure and introduces the Large Separable Kernel Attention-enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast Layer (SPPF-LSKA), improving the model’s capability to extract features from and respond to small objects. Furthermore, the introduction of the Minimum Point Distance IoU (MPDIoU) and Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) enables effective detection of overlapping and occluded targets. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019 dataset show that, compared with YOLOv8, the improved model increases mAP@0.5 by 7.6%, reduces parameter count by 23%, and has a model size of just 5MB. Compared with other current algorithms, The enhanced model delivers the best detection performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Mobile network traffic prediction is critical for efficient network management in 5G and future 6G systems. Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple base stations (BSs) to collaboratively train prediction models without sharing raw data, preserving privacy. This paper presents a unified and extended study of FL for cellular traffic forecasting, integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models including recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).We evaluate these models on real 4G LTE traffic datasets (including recent publicly available data from 2018–2023) and additional large-scale synthetic scenarios. Our results show that FL achieves prediction accuracy comparable to centralized training while avoiding data transmission, and that advanced architectures (e.g. Transformer and graph-based models) can improve forecasting accuracy by up to 5-10% over federated LSTM baselines. We introduce a comprehensive sustainability indicator to assess the trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency of each approach. Through detailed experiments, we quantify the energy consumption and communication overhead of training and inference for each model. The Transformerbased FL model yields the highest accuracy but incurs increased training energy, whereas simpler models are more energy-efficient.We provide visualizations of the accuracy-energy trade-offs and discuss how attention and spatial graph modeling influence performance. The study concludes that FL is a promising solution for privacy-preserving and sustainable mobile traffic prediction. We offer insights into model aggregation strategies, personalization, and the benefits of incorporating external (exogenous) data features. This work uniquely integrates advanced Transformer and GNN architectures within a federated framework, explicitly highlighting improvements over previous recurrent-based methods and emphasizing sustainability metrics critical for practical deployments. Moreover, our evaluation shows that the federated LSTM model achieved up to 10% lower sustainability score (S) compared to centralized approaches, quantifying practical gains for real-world deployments.},

  abstract     = {As smart energy hubs (SEHs) evolve with the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their dynamic charging and discharging processes, they become increasingly susceptible to advanced cyberattacks, especially those targeting electrical and thermal demands. These attacks pose significant risks to integrated systems, including charging stations, vehicle-to-home (V2H) interfaces, and energy storage systems (ESS) comprising batteries for EVs and thermal storage (TS). The analysis focuses on how SEHs respond when subjected to stealthy data manipulation threats that evade detection, which exploit weaknesses in electrical and thermal loads to bypass conventional detection mechanisms and disrupt operational stability. To mitigate these threats, a robust machine learning (ML) framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed. This approach reconstructs compromised load data, restoring system integrity and enhancing resilience. Test scenarios demonstrate that tampered inputs may cause electrical consumption to vary by nearly 17% and thermal usage by approximately 25%, severely impacting SEH stability. Following the deployment of the defense mechanism, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is significantly reduced to 11.96% for electrical demand and 2.33% for thermal demand. The proposed RL-based strategy effectively enhances energy storage systems’ resilience against cyber threats, addressing key vulnerabilities and ensuring stable operations in smart grid ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Icing on wind turbine blades not only degrades aerodynamic efficiency but also poses a significant risk to structural integrity. However, conventional sensor-based or image-based detection systems remain costly and prone to weather-related interference. This study introduces a lightweight, multi-class diagnostic framework designed to classify turbine states as normal, icing, or other anomalies using native SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data. After standardizing and balancing the dataset, key features were selected using three complementary techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature importance, Random Forest feature importance, and Mutual Information ranking. Mutual Information is particularly utilized to identify the non-linear dependencies between features and turbine states, enhancing the feature selection process. Five ensemble learning models—XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and AdaBoost—were benchmarked. Among these, the Extra Trees model provided the optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving an F1 score of 99.54% while maintaining minimal training and inference time. Due to its strong generalization ability and low inference latency, this framework can be efficiently deployed on edge computing platforms or directly within SCADA systems. It offers a scalable, real-time solution for wind farm icing detection and maintenance decision-making, paving the way for cost-effective, rapid-response systems for proactive wind turbine management.},

The RL module adaptively adjusts encryption levels, density strategies, and transmission priorities based on simulated network conditions, while the CKF well filters noisy signals and identifies potential interfering or injection attacks in real time. The complete system is modeled and evaluated using MATLAB simulations, focusing on scenarios linking large model file transfers (up to 1.2 GB) over variable network conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains a 31.5% reduction in average latency, 27.8% increase in throughput, and 99.96% data integrity holding. The CKF-based anomaly detection module achieves a 98.9% detection accuracy with an incorrect alarm rate of 1.3%, and the RL-based optimization leads to a 22% improvement in encryption efficiency compared to fixed-policy systems.

This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76. 83% and 68. 30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.},

Examples of such operations include military engagements, reconnaissance missions, search and rescue efforts, and peacekeeping activities. The design of systems to support C2 is therefore challenging, as they must support structured communication and interaction means among participants. To address this, we developed a method called Method to Support Semantic Interoperability in Command and Control (MAISC2) to support C2, in which we have applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic techniques to pinpoint specific elements in sentences, thereby enhancing the participants’ understanding of the C2 communications. Microservices Architecture (MSA) are known to offer potential benefits over MA, particularly in terms of scalability, independence, and maintenance. Furthermore, some NLP applications have already been developed using MSA, confirming these benefits. This paper presents a version of our system developed using MSA and compares it to its Monolithic Architecture (MA) counterpart. Our objective is to evaluate whether the benefits of adopting MSA, observed in other domains, also apply to C2 support systems based on NLP and semantic techniques, as exemplified by the MAISC2 method. Our results show that MA outperforms MSA in many scenarios; however, as the application load increases, MSA shows increasingly better performance. In particular, although MA had shorter processing and delivery times under normal conditions, MSA delivered better processing performance when handling significantly higher levels of concurrent activity.},

It utilizes a multi-product flow model to balance cost-service trade-offs while considering vehicle scheduling feasibility. Evaluation results from a case study on a commuter rail line in Japan demonstrate the method’s practicality. The revised timetable successfully reduced the number of trips by 5% and the total number of carriages by 4%, whereas satisfying user-defined goals for service quality, such as congestion rates. Interactive searches can be completed within 6 minutes, even when user-defined goals are changed. The optimization process is completed in a timeframe suitable for interactive planning, enabling planners to efficiently explore trade-offs.

Accurate and robust classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for arrhythmia detection remains challenging due to noise, data imbalance, and the complexity of integrating spatial and temporal features. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model for automated ECG-based heartbeat classification, achieving an outstanding classification accuracy of 99.20%. The architecture integrates Residual Network (ResNet)-50 with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features from ECG signals. Unlike most existing methods that treat spatial and temporal components separately, this hybrid integration represents a key novelty, enabling joint learning of hierarchical spatial features and sequential temporal dependencies. Raw ECG waveforms are transformed into two-dimensional scalograms using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), enabling the extraction of rich time-frequency patterns. ResNet-50, enhanced with SE blocks, prioritizes diagnostically relevant spatial features, while LSTM models sequential dependencies critical for identifying cardiac irregularities. The model was trained and validated on a balanced dataset comprising three classes—Arrhythmia (ARR), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), and Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR)—using preprocessing techniques such as denoising, segmentation, and data augmentation. With precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 0.99, the model demonstrates robust generalization and significant potential for integration into clinical diagnostic tools, offering a scalable solution for improved cardiovascular outcomes.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal (Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains. Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study. This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion in biomedical signals is not about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic traditional feature selection methodology. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains. The broader applicability of this theory is discussed, extending its relevance beyond ECG to other biomedical domains involving multimodal time-series data.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid power converters that cascade switched-capacitor stages with conventional LC-based DC/DC switching converters have recently emerged as promising solutions for applications requiring a bipolar DC bus, such as photovoltaic systems and in-chip OLED drivers. However, despite clear advantages in efficiency, compactness, and implementation simplicity, their adoption has been limited due to the lack of accurate modeling and experimental validation. Traditional modeling techniques often fail to capture the static and dynamic behavior of these hybrid topologies. Some previous works either neglected capacitive losses or relied on empirical equivalent models without a clearly defined methodology. The Perilla SIBO (Single-Input Bipolar-Output) Boost Converter is a representative example of this new class of hybrid converters, integrating a conventional Single-Inductor Single-Output (SISO) boost stage with a switched-capacitor inverter. In earlier work, a static model for the Perilla Boost converter was derived using the small-ripple approximation and charge balance principles, assuming matched output capacitors and balanced load conditions—but without considering efficiency estimation. This paper extends the previous model to account for unbalanced loading and mismatched output capacitances and introduces a novel analytical expression to estimate converter efficiency. A comprehensive static modeling and experimental evaluation is presented under realistic operating conditions. The model is validated using a prototype operating across an input voltage range of 3 V to 10 V and delivering output power between 1 W and 20 W. The proposed model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 5.76% and a standard deviation of 5.68%, offering a reliable tool for steady-state performance prediction.

  abstract     = {Speech synthesis, the technology that converts text into spoken words, has advanced significantly for high-resource languages like English, Spanish, and Mandarin. However, many languages spoken by millions of people are still underserved by speech synthesis systems due to insufficient data to train accurate models. An analysis of current solutions and difficulties in low-resource language speech synthesis development is presented in this paper because these languages have restricted data and linguistic resources. The paper examines different research strategies for advancing speech synthesis techniques in these languages by borrowing data from rich-resource languages to enhance models used in poor-resource systems. The primary method involves the comparison of linguistic models that operate between highly supported languages to adapt them to languages that only have limited information available. Acoustic models requiring advancement represent a crucial need to process correctly the phonetic and prosodic attributes within these languages because their traits lack proper representation in small data collections. The paper investigates different data augmentation methods, which include synthetic data generation and multilingual corpus use to enhance available training resources. These methods enhance the quality of computer-generated speech by making it sound more natural while ensuring that the words remain clear and understandable, even in low-resource languages. Notably, data augmentation techniques expanded dataset sizes by up to 27 times, improving model robustness. Additionally, models like WaveNet achieved a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.21, while Tacotron-based systems reached MOS scores as high as 4.38, demonstrating high naturalness even with limited training data. Experiments using less than three hours of training data in low-resource settings initially showedWord Error Rates (WER) exceeding 50–80%, but data augmentation and transfer learning significantly reduced these error rates. By reviewing the present state of research, this paper offers an overview of the progress made in low-resource language speech synthesis. It identifies the potential future directions for this field. Ultimately, the goal is to make speech synthesis more accessible for underrepresented languages, helping with language preservation, assistive technologies, and broader accessibility.},

Current visual assistants often rely on annotations from sighted contributors, which may fail to capture BVI individuals’ preferences and expectations. Addressing this challenge, we explore how to develop optimal, conversational image descriptions that resonate with BVI individuals, and how to effectively scale their creation. We propose a semi-automatic approach that couples large language models (LLMs) with iterative, BVI-driven refinements. Starting with initial LLM-generated image descriptions, a small set of BVI experts refine them to better meet BVI individuals’ needs. These enhanced examples guide subsequent LLM outputs, which are then evaluated by BVI end-users to confirm improved quality and satisfaction. We contribute to constructing large-scale, BVI-centered training data, thereby advancing inclusive and conversational visual accessibility. Throughout our studies, the results showa significant improvement in BVI end-users’ satisfaction with image conversational descriptions when edited by BVI experts. Additionally, the results indicate promising improvements when the LLM regenerates descriptions using those edits as few-shot examples. Moreover, we got valuable insights from BVI participants’ focused mainly on optimizing clarity, relevance, and interaction patterns for image descriptions and conversational exchanges between AI and BVI individuals.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method for controlling a 23-level Single DC Source Hybrid Packed U-Cell (HPUC) converter. The HPUC topology generates a high number of voltage levels with minimal components but presents control challenges due to its numerous switching states and dynamic charging behavior. Unlike conventional control methods, which require accurate models and are sensitive to noise and parameter mismatches, DRL offers a model-free and resilient approach to the non-linear control of such complex systems. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent which is inherently model-free and suited for high-dimensional state spaces and discrete action spaces, is employed to address these issues. To validate the proposed method, simulations were conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed DRL method, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 2.71% in the output current under steady-state, maintaining stable capacitor voltage balancing, and exhibiting rapid dynamic response (e.g., settling within approximately 40 ms for current step changes). Furthermore, its resilience was highlighted by its ability to maintain control despite a 25dB SNR noise condition and up to 15% variations in capacitor values.},

  abstract     = {This research aims to formulate an optimal control algorithm for a hydrothermal air-conditioning system, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption while simultaneously ensuring occupant comfort. Traditional air-conditioning systems often exhibit difficulties in effectively responding to nonlinear dynamic characteristics and variable environmental conditions. Although centralized control strategies can improve energy efficiency, they frequently do not adequately fulfill thermal comfort requirements. To mitigate these challenges, this study introduces an optimal control scheduler that amalgamates machine learning and optimization methodologies, specifically utilizing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Genetic Algorithms. The proposed control scheduler consists of two principal phases. Initially, a forecasting model is constructed using a hybrid approach that integrates Random Forest for predicting water tank temperature and Gradient Boosting for forecasting indoor temperature. In the subsequent phase, an optimization framework is established employing a Genetic Algorithm, aimed at minimizing energy costs and occupant discomfort. This optimization model dynamically adjusts the comfort temperature range based on real-time occupancy estimations, thereby facilitating efficient and adaptive air-conditioning control. The efficacy of the optimal control scheduler was validated in a real-world testbed environment, where its energy efficiency and comfort maintenance were compared to manual control. The findings revealed an 11.41% reduction in energy consumption relative to manual control, alongside an improvement in the comfort maintenance rate from 56.2% to 91.7%, thereby affirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing both energy efficiency and thermal comfort.},

These shortcomings limit their reconstruction accuracy in scenarios with large-scale missing areas. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-scale stable field generative adversarial network (MSSF-GAN) based on U-Net. This method introduces a stable field operator into the generator’s skip connections, enabling effective reconstruction of missing regions in the encoder’s feature maps, thereby improving semantic consistency and feature continuity. Additionally, a multi-scale fusion strategy is adopted to enhance information interaction between features of different scales, thereby improving the model’s ability to perceive high-level semantics. Experimental results demonstrate that MSSF-GAN outperforms mainstream convolutional methods and matches or surpasses recent transformer-based models in challenging large or irregular missing regions. Notably, in face recognition, the generated face images exhibit excellent performance, further validating the effectiveness of our method in precise image reconstruction tasks.},

While these systems offer numerous advantages in monitoring and control, their complexity creates challenges in ensuring reliability and resilience.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML methodologies applied to PHM within the domain of CPS, while exploring key advancements, existing challenges, and future prospects.

The review also highlights emerging trends, including the growing adoption of deep learning techniques such as transformers and large language models. Additionally, it underscores the need for more holistic approaches that address the deeper integration of physical and cyber systems, the complexity of cascading fault scenarios, and the persistent gap between academic research and industrial applications.

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and is characterized by progressive visual field loss due to optic nerve damage. Early detection is fundamental, yet it is often hindered by the asymptomatic nature of the disease in its initial stages. In response to this challenge, advanced techniques such as Deep Learning (DL) and computer vision are emerging as potential tools to revolutionize glaucoma diagnosis. This article aims to systematically evaluate the current state of artificial intelligence approaches for fundus image-based glaucoma detection and to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities. Following the PRISMA methodology, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review examining a total of 63 publications available in Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE, and Web of Science databases, available in English and published during the study period between 2020 and 2024. The review revealed key techniques in the critical stages of automated glaucoma detection. Convolutional neural networks dominated recent literature, with ResNet architectures achieving optimal performance (accuracy range: 82.37%-98.48%). For localization and segmentation, U-Net variants, attention-guided networks, and advanced ensemble approaches were prominent. In feature extraction, methods exploiting structural and textural metrics, wavelet-based transformations, and attention mechanisms showed considerable potential. Classification tasks benefited from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimizations, attention-based architectures, hybrid models, and transformer frameworks, demonstrating high accuracy for both binary and multiclass glaucoma detection. Deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated significant potential for both binary and multiclass glaucoma classification from color fundus images. Key findings from this study include: i) attention mechanisms and transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing subtle disease features, with accuracies exceeding 95%; ii) hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques achieve better generalization across datasets; iii) curriculum learning strategies improve multiclass severity grading accuracy; and iv) challenges persist in standardizing evaluation metrics and managing variations in data quality. Future research should focus on developing more robust architectures that can handle diverse image qualities and incorporate clinical knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, systematic analysis revealed critical implementation barriers: only 30%-40% of studies included external validation, with significant performance degradation on independent datasets; approximately 60%-70% relied on structure-only approaches, excluding essential visual field correlation for clinical decision-making.},

The proposed model integrates self-organizing map (SOM) clustering with collaborative filtering (CF) and differential privacy to enhance both privacy and personalization. A local adjustment strategy is applied to balance data availability with privacy, supported by aggregation, generalization, ϵ-budget management, and Laplace noise injection to mitigate inference attacks. Social network signals were also incorporated to further refine user preference modeling. The system was evaluated using the MovieLens dataset, in which the trade-off between privacy and accuracy was examined under various ϵ values. Key metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to assess the prediction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that PPCF consistently outperforms traditional non-private models and several existing differentially private methods. The model shows improved clustering stability and recommendation accuracy even at lower ϵ levels, though results confirm that small variations in ϵ can notably affect clustering quality. These findings underscore the importance of privacy-utility tuning for practical deployment. Overall, the proposed PPCF approach offers a privacy-resilient, accurate, and scalable solution for collaborative filtering in environments utilize sensitive data.},

This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of industrial automation, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of assembly lines remains a critical objective, particularly as computer vision applications become increasingly pervasive. Traditional assembly line operations often rely heavily on manual labor, resulting in inconsistent performance and elevated error rates. Although conventional automated systems can reduce human intervention to some extent, they frequently lack the flexibility and precision required for handling complex component assembly tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced image analysis techniques to optimize assembly line performance. By leveraging state-of-the-art image processing algorithms, the proposed method enables real-time detection and precise manipulation of components during the assembly process. The system employs a combination of deep learning models for robust object recognition and spatial analysis, ensuring high accuracy in component placement and effective defect detection. The method demonstrates strong adaptability, allowing it to adjust dynamically to various assembly scenarios and production requirements, thereby expanding its applicability across diverse manufacturing workflows. Experimental evaluations reveal a substantial increase in assembly line throughput, alongside a significant reduction in operational errors compared to traditional systems. Our system achieves a detection precision of 92.4% on MVTec AD and 94.1% on KolektorSDD, while reducing false positive rates by 25% relative to baseline models such as YOLOv5 and FastDefectNet. The system also exhibits excellent robustness under different environmental conditions, further reinforcing its industrial viability. These results underscore the transformative potential of integrating sophisticated image analysis technologies into industrial automation systems.},

Designed for MOSFET channel leakage reduction in a voltage converter system, these charge pumps are fabricated in Intel’s latest 18A Gate-all-around (GAA) process technology where the channel leakage of MOSFETs is significant. With Vin set at 1.25 V, which is a SoC fixed input supply and a fixed input clock of 100 MHz from SoC, the designs have a nominal voltage ripple of around 25 mVpp. The design proposes a voltage feedback control with state-space averaging based stability analysis. As the electrical-overstress (EOS) limit for Ribbon FET, the type of MOSFET used in intel 18A, is smaller than 1.25 V, intermediate voltages are generated to tolerate Ribbon FETs’ EOS rules, and proper level shifters are applied to the switches and clock propagation circuits. The final design has a measured maximum current load of ~300 μA and a voltage droop or voltage overshoot from no load to the maximum load of within 40 mV. It also achieves the highest output current density among previous works.},

  abstract     = {An electrolarynx, a widely used assistive device for voice restoration for individuals with laryngeal impairments, often suffers from mechanical buzz and poor intelligibility, limiting its everyday applicability. This work presents a modified recursive least squares (M-RLS) algorithm specifically designed to enhance electrolarynx speech by attenuating the excitation noise characteristic while preserving speech quality. The proposed work is evaluated on data across 44 speech samples and benchmarked against a baseline method using three objective metrics: the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed M-RLS approach demonstrated notable improvements, with PESQ scores reaching 3.01, a median STOI value of 0.7, and an SNR performance comparable to that of the baseline. In addition, to evaluate its feasibility in embedded systems, the algorithm was synthesized in 15 nm technology to form an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power speech enhancement applications. The design occupies 0.289 mm², operates at 1 GHz, and consumes only 16.9 mW, yielding a power-delay product of 15.41 pJ, making it well suited for energy-constrained environments such as electrolarynx-based speech enhancement systems.

  abstract     = {Advanced amorphous oxide devices such as amorphous InGaZnO (α-IGZO) operate based on mechanisms that differ significantly from those of conventional Si-based devices, primarily due to structural differences. While both types of devices utilize field-effect mobility as the primary mode of charge transport, there is no consensus on the additional complexities involved in charge movement within α-IGZO devices, which arise from their unique material properties. The BSIM series model commonly used for silicon devices cannot fully explain the charge transport mechanism of α-IGZO devices. Unfortunately, physics-based compact models for α-IGZO, which reflect the intrinsic nature of charge transport involved in electrical conduction have not been completely proposed with a standard formula. This paper presents a compact model for α-IGZO TFTs that incorporates charge transport mechanisms such as percolation, Variable-Range Hopping (VRH), and Trap-Limited Conduction (TLC), along with a methodology for calculating surface potential using the Lambert W function. The model is implemented in Verilog-A for circuit-level simulation and provides high accuracy with fabricated devices measurement. The model’s performance is further evaluated using the MNIST dataset by comparing the classification accuracy across various shallow-layer neural network architectures, demonstrating the model’s potential in neuromorphic system applications.},

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel and publicly available dataset of children’s scanned drawings and their written explanations of how these drawings represent happiness or sadness. The dataset includes contributions from 5,430 students, with balanced representation across primary and secondary education levels. Gender and education level of children are provided as Metadata. We evaluated emotional classification using both CNN-based and vision transformer-based models, achieving an F1-score of up to 79.03% for emotion recognition from drawings. For the classification of children’s written thoughts, BERT-based models yielded an accuracy of up to 97.53%. Additionally, we trained a generative model by using our dataset to produce emotionally expressive drawings, and subjective evaluations showed that children often preferred AI-generated images over those created by peers.

  abstract     = {With the increase in the number of devices relying on Global Navigation Satellite Sustems (GNSS) and the wide use of such technology for critical applications such as in aviation and autonomous vehicles, security is a main concern. In particular GNSS spoofing attacks and their mitigation attracted much attention in the research community. Availability of efficient methods for combating spoofing are a significant factor in the use of GNSS technology. This paper considers GNSS spoofing detection without the need for despreading the received signal. As a specific application of our method we consider the most commonly used civilian GPS C/A L1 signal. The proposed system consists of two stages: the signal preprocessing stage and the detection stage. We show theoretically that signal samples at the output of the preprocessing stage follow a mixture Gaussian distribution, rather than a Gaussian distribution as infered from other publications based on measurement results. Using computer simulations we demonstrate the adequacy of our mixture Gaussian model. The consequence of our models is that detection methods for such application that are based on the Gaussian model may not be adequate. Then the second stage consists of a type-based technique for spoofing detection. Type detection is a trainable data oriented technique with foundations in Information Theory, and hence it can be considered as a learning algorithm. In our specific application such detector requires training only on a signal without spoofing. In order to apply the type-based detector in our system, a linear quantizer is used and the effect of the number of quantization levels is studied. Simulation results for Receiver Operating Characteritics (ROC) indicate that reliable performance can be achieved when using a type-based detector for GNSS spoofing detection. Furthermore, the shortcomings of energy detection in such applications are also studied. Both theoretical and simulation results indicate the advantages of type-based detection over energy detection in GNSS spoofing discovery.},

The results show that in noiseless conditions, the proposed controller achieves up to 8.40% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to baseline controllers.

As advertising companies and web services actively adopt these techniques to deliver personalized content, user tracking activities have grown more prevalent, often without proper consent, thereby intensifying privacy concerns. In response to this evolving landscape, recent studies have explored machine learning-based approaches to detect tracking behaviors by analyzing script characteristics. However, existing techniques face limitations in identifying previously unknown trackers due to their reliance on known filter lists and insufficient training datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel detection method based on data flow analysis using the Hermes JavaScript engine. By analyzing intermediate representation (IR) and applying a script deobfuscation process, the method effectively tracks data flow across stages such as variable assignment, propagation, function calls, and external leakage. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on large-scale web datasets, including high-traffic websites. The results demonstrate the method’s capability to uncover previously undetected tracking activities, offering greater transparency in how behavioral information is collected and shared. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and comprehensive tracking detection frameworks, strengthening user privacy protection in the modern web ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed an acceleration in the growth of wireless communication technologies, particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, with the direction towards integration with terrestrial networks in the domain of sixth-generation networks. This evolution promises to provide high-speed Internet,low-latency communication, and extended global coverage. However, the availability of sufficient spectrum has become a critical challenge. The purpose of this paper is to review existing literature on dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) between LEO and geostationary satellites, as well as between LEO satellites and terrestrial networks. The contribution of this research lies in its insight into key topics, including LEO constellation development, DSS techniques, spectrum regulatory compliance, current and future mobile satellite frequency allocations, and emerging trends related to providing direct connectivity to user equipment from space. The findings emphasize the importance of DSS as a vital technique to address spectrum scarcity and ensure coexistence between satellites and terrestrial networks. Based on the reviewed literature, we propose three approaches for future research directions that are crucial for providing additional spectrum resources and integration of next-generation satellites and terrestrial networks.},

  abstract     = {Sparse independent component analysis (SICA) variants, including the recently developed SICA-L using Laplacian distribution, excel at extracting interpretable spatial maps from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, these methods exhibit poor temporal recovery performance as they can only model the mixing matrix instead of achieving full temporal recovery. To address this limitation, we propose physiologically informed sparse ICA (PSICA), a framework with a novel mathematical modelY = UpU† pUqΨΦZq for decomposing the observed fMRI data matrixY. This model incorporates physiologically informed basis functions in Up across multiple temporal scales (hemodynamic response functions, discrete cosine transforms, splines, and polynomials) through the representation matrix A = U† pUqΨ and employs dissociation matrices Ψ and Φ for systematic disentanglement of overlapping SICA-L components in Uq and Zq. The algorithm employs efficient block coordinate descent optimization combined with adaptive soft thresholding for spatial component optimization, firm thresholding for background noise elimination, and correlation based greedy selection strategies for temporal basis selection. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of ICA variants by providing enhanced temporal and spatial recovery via representation and dissociation matrices. Comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and experimental datasets (block-design from three subjects and resting-state fMRI) demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed established state-of-the-art methods. It achieved 17% higher average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients compared to SICA-L across synthetic and experimental datasets, successfully addressing existing methods’ primary weakness while achieving superior spatial accuracy. Synthetic dataset and implementation code for all participating algorithms can be accessed at https://github.com/usmankhalid06/PSICA.},

Existing methods often underutilize K-shot support samples, perform poorly on novel categories, suffer from overfitting that degrades base-class performance, and lack efficacy for small objects. To address these, we propose Pseudo-Labeling FSOD (PL-FSOD) based on a teacher-student network.We design an Attention Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (APAFPN) to boost small-object detection via multi-scale attention fusion. The Multi-Branch Region Proposal Network (MBRPN) and Pseudo-Labeling Bounding Box Head (PLBBH) enhance proposal quality and novel-object recall.

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

This approach utilizes deep learning techniques to perform steady-state implicit modeling of the CLLC resonant converter, enabling accurate calculation of voltage gain across a diverse array of switching frequencies and varying load conditions. Based on this model, a deep learning model predictive control (DL-MPC) strategy is developed. The DL-MPC method leverages deep learning-based voltage gain predictions for direct multi-step control sequence prediction. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DL-MPC strategy outperforms conventional proportional-integral (PI) and model predictive control (MPC) control, effectively suppressing voltage overshoot and undershoot, achieving reductions of up to 60.9%, and reducing recovery time by up to 55.6% under load transients and reference voltage step changes, thereby enhancing dynamic response and stability. Experimental validation that DL-MPC achieves a 65.21% reduction in voltage dips and a 31.25% faster recovery time compared to PI control under load transients. Simulation and experimental results consistently show that the deep-learning-based modeling attains high fidelity, while the proposed DL-MPC strategy delivers superior control performance for the CLLC resonant converter, yielding a markedly improved dynamic response.},

This research proposes a hybrid blockchain framework that integrates Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable healthcare data management. Testing with simulated healthcare data across three institutional nodes demonstrated a significant 64% reduction in data retrieval time compared to traditional systems while maintaining exceptional 99.8% uptime reliability.

  abstract     = {Recently, buildings in cities are becoming increasingly larger, resulting in more complex indoor environments. As a result, there is a demand for providing indoor Location-Based Services (LBS). However, high-precision indoor positioning technology is required to provide high-quality LBS indoors. Outdoors, relatively precise positioning can be achieved using the Global Positioning System(GPS). When GPS is used indoors, positioning deteriorates due to walls and obstacles. Therefore, many recent studies propose using Radio Frequency(RF)-based wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ultra-Wide Band(UWB) for indoor positioning. Among these techniques, fingerprinting is adopted in most cases because it is cost-effective and can achieve high accuracy. However, RF-based communication technology causes significant fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) due to environmental uncertainty. In addition, it makes it difficult to distinguish between floors in a multi-story building and to precisely position oneself on a single floor as well. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of integrating fingerprinting and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), an Artificial Intelligence(AI) technology, in an indoor Visible Light Communication (VLC) scenario. VLC utilizes light for data transmission, enabling each floor separation. In contrast to RF, VLC can effectively address signal interference and variation issues. Additionally, DRL can significantly reduce the matching time of fingerprinting. To achieve this goal, we compare and analyze the performance of DRL such as Deep Q-Network(DQN), Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN), and Dueling DQN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly efficient in terms of processing time and positioning accuracy.},

However, social media platforms have increasingly facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, with misleading headlines often serving as vectors for fake news. Traditional methods, such as manual fact-checking, are inadequate in addressing the scale and speed of misinformation dissemination. This study investigates computational approaches for fake news detection in Arabic headlines using machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models specifically pre-trained for the Arabic language. We utilize two benchmark datasets: the AFND dataset—a large-scale collection of Arabic news headlines—and the Arabic News Stance (ANS) dataset, a smaller, unbalanced corpus of annotated claims. Transformer-based models demonstrated superior performance across both datasets. AraBERTv02 achieved the highest accuracy on the large-scale AFND dataset at 70.41%, while AraELECTRA reached 77% accuracy on the smaller ANS dataset. These results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of transformer architectures in capturing nuanced linguistic features relevant to fake news detection in Arabic. Additionally, our experiments reveal that preprocessing choices—such as the application of stemming—impact performance differently across model types, emphasizing the need for tailored preprocessing strategies. This study contributes to the growing body of research in Arabic natural language processing and offers practical insights to improve automated detection of fake news in Arabic media.},

This paper presents an objective method for evaluating QoE in adaptive streaming services, using the commercial tool Video-MOS, which allows real-time monitoring and analysis of multimedia content quality across various platforms and networks. The method aims to provide a precise evaluation that incorporates both technical and subjective factors. This approach integrates multiple factors that influence the overall user perception of adaptive streaming quality, offering greater flexibility and performance, which could contribute to more comprehensive future assessment. The method is validated by a test plan that incorporates a variety of content and scenarios to simulate various network conditions. The results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in predicting QoE, highlighting the rebuffering frequency as a significant factor. In optimal conditions, specific content types can achieve a QoE score as high as 3.36. Conversely, under unfavorable conditions, the QoE may decrease by up to 1.42 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) points, which represents an 80% reduction from its optimal level. Although the rebuffering frequency has a substantial influence, a long initial buffer can have an even more negative effect on QoE, particularly under adverse conditions.

  abstract     = {The rapid progress of deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced various remote sensing tasks. However, detecting changes in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images continues to be a challenge due to the complexity of the image details and limited amount of training samples. Currently, there is considerable research to achieve precise change detection (CD). This is particularly true for addressing issues such as improved detection of small targets, undulating borders and minimized noise in the output change features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the triple-attention network (TANet), which incorporates three robust attention mechanisms; namely, channel, spatial, and frequency attentions, across both spatial and frequency domains. This is achieved by using dynamic channel attention (DCA), spatial support attention (SSA) and frequency refinement attention (FRA). In addition, we propose an advanced fusion process namely geographic matching module (GeoMM) that efficiently combines complementary information from the input bi-temporal features enabling high accuracy predictions. By integrating these powerful modules, TANet improves the model’s capacity to accurately represent changes and dynamically refine deep features at each layer by concentrating on the most critical information. Experiments on two prominent CD datasets (LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD) demonstrate that the proposed TANet outperforms previous notable approaches, with extensive ablation studies evaluating the effects of attention modules and frequency components optimization. These findings highlight TANet’s potential as a state-of-the-art solution for precise and reliable CD in VHR remote sensing imagery.},

  abstract     = {Emerging applications such as extreme virtual reality, enterprise access, 5G front-haul / back-haul, and future 6G immersive services demand exceptional bandwidth and low latency. Next-generation passive optical networks (PONs), including 25G/50G-EPON (Ethernet PON) and 50G-PON, address these requirements. However, the telecoms sector faces sustainability challenges, with networks consuming over 75% of the sector’s energy and contributing more than 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is increasing with bandwidth demand. Fiber-based PON networks offer high-speed, low-latency, and energy-efficient solutions. To further enhance energy efficiency, we developed a dynamic bandwidth wavelength allocation (DBWA) algorithm for 50G-EPON systems, adapted for single- and dual-wavelength configurations. For single-wavelength (1 × 50G) configurations, the sleep mode aware algorithm (SMA) activates the optical network unit (ONU) sleep mode when no data are transmitted, reducing energy consumption and ensuring minimal delay due to the absence of wavelength switching. For dual-wavelength (2 × 25G) systems, the online restricted wavelength switching (RWS) algorithm dynamically allocates wavelengths upon receiving user reports, regulating the switching to minimize delays while achieving energy savings at the ONU. Finally, leveraging a predictive approach, the offline restricted wavelength usage and switching (RWUS) algorithm evaluates bandwidth demands over 0.1-second intervals, enabling energy-efficient wavelength switching and optimizing both optical line terminal (OLT) and ONU energy usage. The simulation results highlight the superior energy efficiency of the offline RWUS algorithm and the extended ONU sleep times, especially under low load conditions, while maintaining the lowest delay among multi-wavelength algorithms. Conversely, despite being less energy-efficient, the SMA algorithm scores slightly better in delay for single-wavelength systems. All algorithms ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), providing reliable bandwidth allocation for various profiles. These results support green PON deployments and recommend the RWUS algorithm for two-wavelength 50G-EPON systems (2 × 25G) and SMA for single-wavelength 50G-EPON (1 × 50G) to optimize energy efficiency, latency, and quality of service.},

An event-triggered communication-based matrix-scaled resilient algorithm is proposed to mitigate the influence of malicious nodes on normal agent convergence while significantly reducing communication overhead among agents. Furthermore, by employing system transformation, necessary and sufficient conditions for network topology are established to address the resilient matrix-scaled consensus problem.

  abstract     = {Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material’s complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot’s arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of cybersecurity, the extraction of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is vital for acquiring accurate Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) from reputable sources. The extracted CTI must be evaluated to ensure high quality, and different CTI platforms, such as VirusTotal, AlienVault, and MetaDefender, often yield varying evaluations. A robust method is required that automatically extracts CTI, evaluates it, and provides a verdict on IoCs, determining whether they are malicious, while also evaluating IoC information across multiple platforms. In this work, we propose an automated mechanism that first extracts TTPs and IoCs from reputable threat reports, submits the extracted CTI to multiple platforms, evaluates the platform responses using four key metrics —accuracy, freshness, completeness, and relevance, and provides weighted verdicts for IoCs. We tested 600 IoCs in February 2025, and the weighted verdict matched those of VirusTotal for 79.4%, AlienVault for 87.4%, and MetaDefender for 39.6% of the IoCs. The results also show that VirusTotal provides a consistent evaluation of various types of IoCs in terms of freshness, completeness, and relevance of information, whereas AlienVault shows inconsistencies across all IoC types, and MetaDefender shows inconsistency for some. VirusTotal also outperforms the other two when it comes to providing fresher and more complete intelligence, while AlienVault provides the most relevant information in terms of Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) 2.1 objects.},

  abstract     = {Integrating AI models with the medical domain is challenging as it involves more complex workflows compared to traditional machine learning operations (MLOps). Requirements such as model performance monitoring, calibration, and retraining on live medical data, as well as underdeveloped XAI and MLOps integration, have not yet been fully covered by existing works. This paper proposes the MLXOps4Medic, an initial machine-learning-and-explaining operations (MLXOps) framework based on the microservices architecture for AI model development in the medical domain. The framework focuses on four types of tasks in the MLXOps: training, model evaluation, XAI explanation generation, and XAI evaluation. It can orchestrate tasks between different types of microservices, automatically transferring the necessary data and configurations for task execution to reduce operational overhead. Additionally, the framework collects the provenance of the workflow metadata and builds a provenance network, which facilitates workflow tracing and reproducibility throughout the complex MLXOps lifecycle. Three case studies illustrate the key findings concerning the framework: (1) a significant reduction in operational overhead by approximately 72.55% resulting from complex AI experiments; (2) facilitation of MLXOps customization for complex workflows such as data drift monitoring, integration of multimodal medical AI models, and reproduction of historical training data; and (3) provision for prediction and explanation generation for medical AI models through a web portal. Furthermore, the framework is compared with the well-established MLOps framework called MLflow on a general domain MLX pipeline execution, demonstrating observable efficiency in terms of zero-code configuration for the training task and utilizing 36.14% less time for training task execution. These key findings demonstrate that the MLXOps4Medic framework delivers an efficient and highly adaptable MLXOps solution for AI and medical integration. By addressing identified challenges in workflow orchestration, it serves as a foundational framework with far-reaching implications for future research and applications across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {The modal analysis of structures containing ferrite materials is one of the greatest challenges of computational electrodynamics and goes beyond the scope of commercial software’s capabilities. The reason for this is the strong dependence of the ferrite parameters on frequency. From a numerical point of view, the task boils down to a nonlinear eigenproblem (NLEVP), the solution of which is not trivial. In particular, if the problem involves more complex structures (modeled using discrete techniques), NLEVP contains matrices of enormous dimensions and its solution seems impossible. The method proposed in this paper is based on the projection of the NLEVP onto a smaller subspace obtained by hybridizing finite element method (FEM) and the mode matching (MM) technique. This approach reduces the size of the problem, which directly improves the efficiency of the algorithm, but also allows solving NLEVP using methods whose results can be verified with controlled accuracy (unlike previous attempts to use Beyn’s method). The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been validated through numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrating a complex mode structure of a microwave spherical cavity strongly coupled to a yttrium iron garnet sphere. The results pave the way for rigorous electrodynamic modeling of spin-to-electromagnetic coupling with emerging applications in magnonic and quantum technologies. Finally, it is worth mentioning that NLEVPs are not exclusively used for electromagnetic problems and an effective algorithm for solving them could also find application in other fields of technology.},

To address this question, this paper explores how WM is represented in EEG-based HCI experiments, with the aim of informing interface and system design that more effectively aligns with users’ cognitive capacities and limitations. A total of 132 studies published between 2018 and 2024 were reviewed to identify HCI use-cases involving EEG to study WM, outline key WM concepts, and evaluate how these align with findings from other disciplines. The findings indicate that WM-related EEG studies in HCI aim to enhance user interaction through more efficient signal analysis and the development of adaptive systems and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the findings also highlight the lack of theoretical grounding for EEG-based WM research within HCI. Key cognitive theories are often overlooked, and the strong association between WM and Attention is rarely acknowledged. Although the neural basis of Working Memory (WM) is well represented, its conceptualization within HCI remains underdeveloped and often misaligned with advances in cognitive science and psychology—potentially limiting the development of safe, effective, and cognitively-aware user-centered technologies. Based on these findings, we recommend: (a) integrating alternative models of Working Memory (WM) into HCI system design; (b) incorporating Attention evaluation in EEG-based WM experiments; and (c) exploring the development of a custom WM foundation model to address conceptual limitations in HCI and variability across tasks, users, and environments.},

  abstract     = {Traffic sign detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, yet remains a challenging task due to factors such as small object sizes, distant placements, complex lighting conditions, and frequent occlusions. This paper introduces a hybrid detection framework that integrates three advanced models: YOLOv12 (a high-speed one-stage detector), Detectron2 with Faster R-CNN (a precision-focused two-stage detector), and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier. The proposed system is trained and evaluated on the Self-Driving Cars Dataset (SDCD) from Roboflow, featuring 15 traffic sign classes in complex urban environments. Detection outputs are merged using an overlapping box fusion strategy, and a ViT module further verifies predictions, resolves conflicting labels, and filters false positives. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid system achieves 97.7% mAP@50 and 88.3% mAP@50:95, outperforming individual detectors and previous hybrid approaches. Qualitative analysis shows substantial improvements in detecting small, occluded, and overlapping signs. The inclusion of ViT reduces both false positives and missed detections. While this ensemble increases computational complexity, it offers enhanced robustness, making it suitable for safety-critical applications. Future work will focus on improving inference efficiency and validating the system on larger and more diverse datasets such as TT100K to assess generalization performance across wider environments.},

  abstract     = {A microgrid network is characterized by a high R/X ratio, making the voltage more sensitive to active power changes compared to bulk power systems, where the voltage is regulated primarily by reactive power. Due to its sensitivity, voltage control approaches for microgrids should also consider the active power input coupling, making it very different from conventional power systems. Additionally, as the energy costs associated with active and reactive powers are different and the operational conditions of microgrids connected to active distribution systems vary over time, the ideal controller to provide voltage support must be flexible enough to handle these technical and operational constraints. This paper proposes a model predictive control approach to provide dynamic voltage support using energy storage systems. This approach uses a simplified predictive model of the system to solve the model predictive control problem. By proper selection of model predictive control weighting parameters, the quality of service provided can be adjusted to achieve the desired performance. A simulation study in Matlab/Simulink validates the proposed approach for the Cordova, Alaska microgrid.

The systematic performance evaluation of pairing-free PRE schemes for blockchain environments is conducted through extensive benchmarking of three schemes implemented in Go. Results show self PRE achieves superior security but incurs 13.7% higher execution time than certificateless schemes. To address vulnerabilities, this work proposes a secure CL-PRE framework with enhanced validation mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful tool for encapsulating high-dimensional data within neural network parameters, providing continuous and differentiable representations. However, INR faces challenges such as prioritizing low-frequency components over high-frequency details (known as the spectral bias problem) and slow convergence during training. To mitigate these issues, we explore the application of transfer learning for INR models. We observe that transfer learning not only accelerates model convergence but also improves learning efficiency and enhances the representation of high-frequency details. Furthermore, we find that source images exhibiting higher edge density and contrast, along with reduced homogeneity, significantly enhance the learning performance on subsequent target images. This study provides new insights into the application of transfer learning in INR models and highlights its potential to enhance image reconstruction quality.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new design for a reflectarray antenna (RAA) that utilizes a variable rotation technique (VRT) and features a compact, single-layer substrate without the use of vias or air gaps. The proposed design achieves performance comparable to that of complex, multi-layer structures in terms of high gain, broad bandwidth, circular polarization, aperture efficiency, and low sidelobe and cross-polarization levels. Additionally, it offers the narrowest beamwidth among similar designs, making it a promising solution for point-to-point communication systems that require precise directionality. The resonance characteristics of the proposed RAA unit cell have been analyzed using characteristic mode analysis (CMA). Each element in the RAA is rotated to a specific angle, creating the required reflection phase distribution across the array and steering the main beam toward the desired direction. Furthermore, to enhance overall performance, the RAA is center-fed by a wideband, dual-circularly polarized corrugated horn antenna. The main beam direction is set at (θ0 = –20°, ϕ0 = 90°), with a focal ratio of f / D = 1.1, which was selected to maximize aperture efficiency. A reflecting aperture measuring 143.43 mm × 143.43 mm, consisting of 37 × 37 elements, was fabricated and tested. The proposed RAA exhibits a measured 1.5-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 32% and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 27.5%, with a measured peak gain of 28.6 dBic. The measured total aperture efficiency (TAE) reaches 40.5% at 25 GHz. The measured sidelobe and cross-polarization levels are less than –19.2 dB and –26.3 dB, respectively.},

Our proposed Masked Deep Embedding of Patches (MDEP) pre-training method, an extension of the masked autoencoder (MAE) transformer, significantly improves dental caries detection performance compared to traditional baselines. Key contributions include utilizing self-supervised learning for limited dental radiograph data, replacing MAE’s patch reconstruction with the reconstruction of patch embeddings, and achieving notable performance enhancements in caries detection. This research paves the way for AI-driven solutions in dentistry, offering valuable tools for dentists and patients in the early detection and management of dental caries. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of our proposed method using another dataset, CariesXrays.

  abstract     = {Rotating machinery is crucial in industrial production, and its stable operation directly affects both efficiency and safety. However, diverse operating conditions, non-stationary signals, and complex environments pose significant challenges for fault diagnosis. To address these issues, we propose a multi-granularity information fusion network to improve fault classification in complex scenarios. FusionNet first applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to decompose time-series signals, enabling in-depth extraction of key time-frequency features. Next, the multi-granularity feature extraction module focuses on multi-scale and sparse features, dynamically capturing local variations in fault information to enhance and supplement the overall sequence while effectively suppressing noise interference. After that, the Swin-Transformer with window-based interaction adaptively fuses these multi-granularity features, progressively integrating both local details and global dependencies. Finally, the Multi-Granularity Feature Aggregation Module combines features from different scales layer-by-layer and incorporates channel attention to highlight critical fault patterns. Experiments conducted with two datasets, the benchmark CWRU, and a self-developed dataset, show that FusionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for fault diagnosis. In CWRU, it achieves an average accuracy of 99.67% in four operating conditions. In the self-developed Paper Delivery Structure Coupling dataset, it reaches 99.44%, outperforming conventional models like LSTM by 30.90%.},

The research demonstrates that current-generation LRM-based AI agents, when collaborating with human experts, can significantly expedite the development of complex algorithms. We test the hypothesis that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting plus domain-expert oversight reduces the derivation-error rate and development time of high-order numerical schemes relative to typical prompting. The primary objective of the present manuscript is to explore and assess the potential of currently available advanced reasoning Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to assist in the algorithm development process. To this end, the derivation of key formulae within the widely utilised Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) algorithm serves as a case study. We employ the WENO algorithm as a test case to help evaluate and demonstrate the capabilities of several AI models in this context, thereby laying the foundation for future research and development in this field. The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, a high-order algorithm applicable to various fields such as fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and medical imaging, was used as a case study. The interaction between a human expert and an LRM was examined in the context of designing and deploying a WENO scheme for simulating vortical flows. Initial AI-generated responses, while generally accurate, required iterative refinement guided by expert knowledge and a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to correct minor errors and optimise performance. This iterative process demonstrated the importance of user involvement, fostering both deeper engagement and a clearer understanding of the algorithm’s intricacies. Optimal performance was achieved through a collaborative partnership that leverages the AI’s computational speed and the human’s ability to perform logical decomposition and error detection. This collaborative approach facilitates the rapid development of tailored solutions. This study highlights the transformative potential of AI copilots in scientific research, showing that their effectiveness is maximised through synergy with domain experts.

ANFIS models were developed and validated using two real industrial cases: a local plastic manufacturer and a global food manufacturer to capture and analyze relationships within supply chains across key attributes—security, survivability, recovery, technological capabilities, and sustainability. This research highlights the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system (FIS), including membership function types within the ANFIS framework, in achieving computational efficiency and precision for modeling dynamic supply chain systems. The models were validated using two standard metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), ensuring accurate predictions. Results showed that the global food company had lower average errors, indicating a more stable and reliable supply chain with a testing error of 5%. In contrast, the local plastic company exhibited higher errors in some areas, with an average error of 8%, suggesting areas for improvement. Overall, this study underscores the potential of ANFIS as a powerful tool for providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of supply chains, thereby offering a robust approach to enhancing their resilience. The findings suggest that companies can significantly benefit from adopting this neuro-fuzzy model (i.e., ANFIS), particularly when combined with continuous data refinement and targeted improvements to address specific vulnerabilities in their supply chains.},

However, in ELAA systems, the required number of pilot signals can become excessive, especially in multi-user scenarios, making channel estimation for all antennas particularly challenging. In addition, ELAAs present challenges as the near-field region becomes more prominent, rendering traditional channel estimation methods inefficient. To address this, we propose to utilize a channel knowledge map for channel estimation in ELAA systems, enabling seamless near-field and far-field communication while reducing the pilot overhead. To enhance the practicality of the channel knowledge map in ELAA systems, we propose a channel angle distance map (CADM) database that provides the angles and distances of multipaths from the polar-domain for a given location. The estimated channel parameters are adopted as initial values and refined through the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm to minimize the channel estimation error. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CADM-based method outperforms benchmark schemes with reduced pilot overhead.},

Traditional control mechanisms, often based on rule-based systems, fail to cope with the dynamic and stochastic nature of these grids. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for load balancing, integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a dual-layer control architecture. This framework employs both local agent-based decision-making and a global critic network for system-wide optimization. The approach is designed to adapt to the temporal and spatial variability inherent in modern power grids, ensuring efficient load distribution and stability across various operating conditions. We introduce the Grid-aware Structured Embedding Network (GSEN), a novel model that enhances power grid state estimation by capturing multi-scale topological and temporal dependencies. GSEN integrates spectral graph convolutions and temporal attention mechanisms, providing robust, real-time predictions. The Stability-Aware Adaptive Inference Mechanism (SAIM) enhances the stability and adaptability of the model by dynamically adjusting inference pathways based on real-world grid conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional methods and state-of-the-art models, showing significant improvements in load balancing efficiency and energy dispatch precision.

  abstract     = {The enhancement of detailed facial features is a critical challenge in the application of inverse engineering within the medical field. However, existing methods: Position map Regression Network (PRNet), Detailed Expression Capture and Animation (DECA) exhibit insufficient accuracy in reconstructing mid-frequency details. To address this, we propose a single-view 3D face reconstruction method based on a multi-scale feature fusion encoder, which integrates local and global features to extract mid-frequency geometric details, thereby improving the fidelity of facial expression reconstruction. Furthermore, deformable convolutions are employed to optimize the generator network, enabling precise localization of mid-frequency detail regions associated with expressive geometry. This significantly enhances the accuracy of detail reconstruction, particularly for mid-frequency geometric features.Experimental validation on the FaceScape dataset demonstrates that, compared to the DECA algorithm, our network achieves a 9.1% improvement in Chamfer Distance and a 12.3% reduction in mean normal error. The evaluation on the REALY benchmark also achieved a significant 28.0% reduction in comprehensive frontal-view error compared to DECA, confirming its capability to accurately represent mid-frequency contour details of facial structures.},

  abstract     = {Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies are increasingly used to support individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet their usability and effectiveness remain underexplored. Individuals diagnosed with autism frequently engage with software applications; however, many fail to address core challenges outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), particularly in communication, social interaction, and behavior. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines usability evaluation methods (UEMs) and their role in enhancing life skills for individuals with ASD, focusing on these three domains. This study employs the Tollgate approach to establish clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. A comprehensive search across five major databases (ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) yielded 3,436 articles, of which 65 were selected for analysis. Findings reveal that questionnaires are the most commonly used UEMs (24.18%), with a stronger emphasis on social interaction and communication than on other ASD-related challenges. This SLR offers a systematic foundation for designing user-centered applications that improve social, communication, and behavioral life skills in individuals with ASD.},

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

  abstract     = {Epileptic seizures impair patients’ health and quality of life, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based prediction enables timely intervention. Early work on epileptic seizure prediction employed linear models, whereas recent studies employ more advanced machine learning and deep learning models. We review 149 studies (2018—May 2025), summarizing trends and gaps across the full pipeline in EEG-based epileptic seizure prediction. We find that four persistent challenges related to this domain remain. First, severe dataset imbalance, with overreliance on Children’s Hospital Boston–Massachusetts Institute of Technology EEG dataset (CHB-MIT), minimal use of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) datasets, and infrequent integration of public and private datasets. Second, preprocessing practices remain rigid, often involving segmentation into windows of 10 s or less, fixed preictal horizons of 30 to 60 min, basic filtering and undersampling procedures. Third, limited model diversity, as most studies use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with scant exploration of Transformers or graph neural networks (GNNs), dimensionality reduction is predominantly implicit and few linear baselines. Fourth, validation and deployment are fragmented, with fixed warning horizons, single evaluation protocols, missing clinical metrics, static thresholds or k-of-n voting, minimal interpretability, and few real-world implementations. Future work should assemble heterogeneous EEG datasets, adopt adaptive multiscale preprocessing, and build unified benchmarks that pit CNN, Transformer, GNN, and related models against well-tuned linear baselines—advancing flexible non-convolutional designs beyond the time-frequency paradigm, mandating ablations that contrast implicit with explicit, task-aware dimensionality reduction, and pairing these evaluations with clinically aligned validation, dynamic risk-aware thresholds, embedded interpretability, and prospective testing on energy-efficient edge hardware in ward and home settings.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

  abstract     = {Topic detection in social networks is extracting and summarizing frequent posts about an event or subject. Topic detection is a complex process and depends on language because it somehow needs to analyze text. There have been few studies on topic detection in Persian, and the existing algorithms are not remarkable. Therefore, we aimed to study topic detection in Persian. The objectives of this study are: 1) to conduct an extensive study on the best algorithms for topic detection, 2) to identify necessary adaptations to make these algorithms suitable for the Persian language, and 3) to evaluate their performance on Persian social network texts. To achieve these objectives, we have formulated two research questions: First, considering the lack of research in Persian, what modifications should be made to existing frameworks, especially those developed in English, to make them compatible with Persian? Second, how do these algorithms perform, and which one is superior? There are various topic detection methods that can be categorized into different categories. Frequent pattern and clustering are selected for this research, and a hybrid of both is proposed as a new category. Then, ten methods from these three categories are selected. All of them are re-implemented from scratch, changed, and adapted with Persian. These ten methods encompass different types of topic detection methods and have shown good performance in English. The text of Persian social network posts is used as the dataset. Additionally, a new multiclass evaluation criterion, called FS, is used in this paper for the first time in the field of topic detection. Approximately 1.4 billion tokens are processed during experiments. The results indicate that if we are searching for keyword-topics that are easily understandable by humans, the hybrid category is better. However, if the aim is to cluster posts for further analysis, the frequent pattern category is more suitable.},

  abstract     = {The upper 6 GHz band (U6 GHz, 6.425-7.125 GHz) has been identified as a new international mobile telecommunication (IMT) spectrum in the World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23). In the recent six generation (6G) workshop of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the U6 GHz band is also anticipated as a potential 6G core spectrum. Additionally, the industry at the 6G workshop shares a common vision to obtain significant spectral efficiency gain for the user for not being at the expense of excess energy consumption or excess transmit power. To meet the 6G vision for the U6 GHz band, it is promising to apply the extreme receive antennas (ERA)-aided multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) with the receive antennas in the mobile device at least twice the spatial streams in the MIMO system. For example, by applying 12 × 4 or 8 × 4 MIMO (12 or 8 receive antennas in the mobile device for 4 spatial streams), user experienced spectral efficiency can reach up to 37 bps/Hz in this study, which is more than twice that of the current fifth generation (5G) 4 × 4 MIMO with the same 4 spatial streams. Note that the significant spectral efficiency gain is obtained with the same transmit power as compared to 4 × 4 MIMO at the base station. However, for the mobile device, to accommodate sufficiently many receive antennas for the ERA-aided MIMO application is a challenging task. For this application, we present an extremely low profile (ELP, 0.5 mm only) four-antenna module covering the U6 GHz band for MIMO communications. To our knowledge, the ELP four-antenna module has the smallest thickness (0.5 mm only) among related MIMO antenna modules reported to cover the U6 GHz band. The ELP feature allows the four-antenna module to be easily accommodated in the backcover region of modern mobile devices. By applying three ELP four-antenna modules, the mobile device can conveniently be equipped with 12 MIMO antennas. We present details of the ELP four-antenna module and fabricate three of them mounted in a smartphone-like device for 4 × 4, 8 × 4, and 12 × 4 MIMO performance evaluation. Note that the 12 × 4 MIMO has not yet been reported and is demonstrated for the first time in this study. The results obtained indicate that the ELP four-antenna module works for the ERA-aided MIMO with four spatial streams to achieve significant spectral efficiency gain in the U6 GHz band.},

  abstract     = {Modern power systems are increasingly complex and interconnected, demanding intelligent, adaptive solutions for fault detection and operational resilience. Traditional methods often depend on linear approximations or computationally demanding simulations, which struggle to capture the nonlinear, time-varying dynamics of real-world power networks. To address these challenges, this study proposes an advanced framework that integrates spectral graph theory with deep learning, offering a more efficient and accurate approach to fault detection. Central to the framework is the Spectral-Temporal Energy Flow Graph (STEF-Graph), which models spatial and temporal interactions within the grid. By applying spectral filters in the graph’s eigenbasis, the system learns high-level spatial features reflective of the network topology. Concurrently, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) process temporal sequences, enabling robust predictions of system states under dynamic conditions. To ensure practical viability, a projection operator is applied to enforce physical constraints such as voltage limits, line capacity, and stability requirements. This ensures all predictions remain operationally feasible. Based on these predictive insights, the Graph-Informed Energy Adjustment Mechanism (GEAM) is introduced to guide control decisions. GEAM balances localized efficiency with system-wide coordination using a graph-regularized penalty, ensuring both adaptability and coherence. STEF-Graph and GEAM jointly constitute an integrated two-module framework that boosts fault detection precision while strengthening the grid’s adaptability to disruptions and fluctuations. This research contributes to the development of scalable, data-driven methodologies aligned with the evolving demands of modern energy systems, and reflects the journal’s emphasis on innovative computational methods for complex infrastructures.},

Further, a 2-stage constant current (CC) charging approach is developed for a solar-powered EV charging system. This work provides a detailed quadratic layout with boosting of the input voltage, steady-state operations, and inductor current conduction states. Additionally, it includes mathematical analysis considering non-ideal conditions, parameter design criteria, and performance comparison of the proposed converter with existing ones. The converter’s performance is initially validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations for a 3-kW power level. Afterward, the proposed topology is integrated into a PV-powered EV battery charging architecture. A feedforward neural network-based MPPT algorithm is implemented to extract solar power effectively. To enhance battery health, a 2-stage CC charging approach is applied where the charging current is dynamically adjusted with battery state of charge (SOC). To investigate the behaviour of the system under varying irradiance, simulations and real-time implementation on the OPAL-RT (OP-4512) platform under Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) with Texas Instruments (TI-F28379D) controller are conducted. Also, a 100 W scaled-down converter prototype is built to test its feasibility and efficacy under diverse conditions. The experimental efficiency is obtained as 95.6%. The resemblance among the experimental and simulation results, together with the results achieved in the CHIL environment, confirms the practical feasibility of the converter and establishes the proposed system as a prospective solution to intelligent solar-integrated EV charging infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {A flight control system must balance tracking accuracy, control smoothness, and energy use under nonlinear dynamics, disturbances, actuator dynamics, and delays. Existing schemes (e.g., LQR, MPC) typically treat the problem as single-objective with fixed weights, provide limited guarantees for multi-objective trade-offs, and often neglect actuator dynamics, delays, or automated selection of weights—making consistent performance under uncertainty difficult. This paper presents an adaptive Neural-network Pareto-based Optimal Control (NPOC) framework that formalizes a weighted four-objective cost—energy usage, state deviation, control smoothness, and time-weighted tracking error. We prove the existence of optimal solutions within the weighted multi-objective formulation and derive a new state-feedback control law with closed-loop stability established via Lyapunov analysis. Actuator dynamics and signal delays are explicitly modeled within the control synthesis. A multilayer-perceptron decision maker, trained on simulation-augmented data, maps desired performance metrics (RMSE and energy) to weight selections, enabling automatic adaptation of the controller. Validation on a nonlinear quadcopter with wind disturbances, sensor noise, and 50% mass variation shows improved tracking accuracy, smoother inputs, and favorable energy usage compared with LQR and MPC. Monte Carlo trials over multiple initial conditions and ANOVA tests (p-values above significance thresholds) confirm robustness and statistical reliability. These results demonstrate a mathematically grounded and adaptive control methodology for multicopters operating under complex nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty.},

By combining human adaptability with robotic precision, this hybrid model offers greater flexibility than fully automated systems. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on specific collaboration tasks such as order picking and storage, while important areas like human-robot coexistence scenarios and inbound/outbound logistics remain underexplored. This imbalance highlights gaps in understanding dynamic task allocation, safety considerations, and process integration across different warehouse stages. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on human–robot collaboration in warehouse environments, analyzing 52 representative studies across multiple dimensions. The review identifies key research gaps, including limited exploration of human-centered factors, insufficient integration of physical and decision-making collaboration, and a lack of unified frameworks for multi-agent and cross-mode coordination. To address these gaps, future research directions are proposed, focusing on dynamic cross-modal collaboration, trust and fatigue-aware systems, and leveraging natural language interfaces to enhance human-centered interaction. By emphasizing these aspects, this review aims to guide the design of more efficient, adaptive, and human-friendly collaborative warehouse systems that better meet the challenges of real-world operations.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication enhances safety by allowing moving vehicles to exchange real-time information. However, due to dynamic environment, V2V links are vulnerable to blockage due to obstacles.We propose the use of aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance V2V communication reliability by reflecting the signal between moving vehicles. Then we adopt the power consumption models for multirotor UAVs, where three flight statuses, i.e., forward flight, vertical ascent, and vertical descent, are included into the system model. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) position of ARIS and the transmit power of the system, while ensuring a minimum data rate requirement to meet quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, the EE optimization is solved using Dinkelbach’s iterative algorithm and interior point method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmark methods, with optimized hybrid ARIS yielding the highest EE compared to passive ARIS scheme.},

  abstract     = {Robust path tracking for intelligent vehicles represents a critical challenge due to model uncertainties and varying operational conditions. This paper proposes a novel model-data-driven sliding mode control (MDD-SMC) framework to address this issue. The core of this framework is a hybrid controller architecture. A model-based law, founded on SMC principles, governs the nominal vehicle dynamics to ensure baseline stability and robustness. This is synergistically integrated with a data-driven compensator, designed based on model-free adaptive control theory, which actively learns and rejects composite disturbances arising from unmodeled dynamics, parameter errors, and external interferences. Furthermore, a guidance law is employed to fuse lateral and heading errors into a single composite variable, simplifying the control problem to a provably stable single-input single-output system. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed MDD-SMC consistently achieves superior tracking accuracy and stability over conventional control methods, particularly in challenging high-speed and low-adhesion scenarios. This framework therefore provides a highly adaptive and effective solution, significantly enhancing vehicle safety and control precision.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has significantly transformed the way organizations utilize computing resources by offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Energy consumption has become a major research concern with the growing demand for cloud services these days. Adaptive energy optimization techniques are very much essential to minimize energy usage across cloud servers. The main objective of this research is to conserve energy across heterogeneous cloud servers in datacentres. The proposed adaptive energy optimization framework uses container orchestration utilizing Kubernetes framework by sharing the host system kernel and reducing resource overhead to maximize energy efficiency. The work also incorporates smart algorithms, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Swarm Intelligence, and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to enable the real-time, energy cognizant distribution of workloads according to the current demand, avoiding unnecessary consumption of resources. Kubernetes container orchestration to optimize energy usage, facilitating effective scaling and thus simplifying the management of applications. Two novel components, the Adaptive Resource Adjustment Algorithm (ARAA) and the Automated Resource-Aware Kubernetes Lifecycle Management (ARKLM), work together to dynamically adjust resource allocation and deactivate idle containers within the Kubernetes environment. Experimental results confirm the framework’s effectiveness, demonstrating that the DVFS algorithm achieved a low 0.94% average CPU usage, while the ACO algorithm delivered the fastest execution time. This dual-focus on energy efficiency and speed makes the framework a scalable and sustainable solution for modern cloud operations, aligning with UNSustainable Development Goals (7, 9, 12, 13, 17) by enabling energy-efficient, low-carbon, and collaborative cloud operations through intelligent automation.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of connected devices and the exponential growth of generated data have revealed several limitations of classical cloud-centric architectures, notably in latency, bandwidth saturation, and data privacy. In response to these challenges, fog and edge computing paradigms have emerged, promoting decentralized processing by bringing computation and storage capabilities closer to data sources. Federated learning is a distributed paradigm for training machine learning models, to preserve data privacy and reduce communication costs. Among the widely adopted strategies are federated stochastic gradient descent, which aggregates client-side gradients, and federated averaging, which computes an average of local model parameters. Nevertheless, these approaches often overlook disparities in data quality and the varying contributions of participating clients, which may degrade model performance, particularly in non-iid or heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel aggregation framework for federated learning, leveraging an orchestrator model to identify the client whose data distribution most closely aligns with the given input, rather than applying uniform aggregation across all client models, as done in FedAvg. In our methodology, each client employed a distinct machine learning algorithm trained on three categories of datasets: first related to human activity recognition, second the other comprising MRI data and MIMIC-III dataset. The proposed approach achieved high accuracies of 99.90% on the UCI-HAR dataset, 99.13% on the MRI dataset and 99.55% on the MIMIC-III dataset, and also, we compared the proposed approach with other well-known personalized federation methods such as FedPro, FedPer, pFedHN and Fed-Clustering.},

Each client enriches its local data with a domain-specific prompt to a frozen large language model (LLM), then performs proximal-regularized updates that are aggregated on the server under the Gaussian mechanism with client-level ℓ2 clipping. Each update is clipped to a fixed radius C, yielding per-round sensitivity Sr=2C/m for m participating clients, and noise scaled by σ ensures rigorous (ε, δ)-DP. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving an O(T−1/2) worst-client descent rate for non-convex objectives and a linear rate under γ-strong convexity, consistent with the empirical decay of gradient norms. On two real-world benchmarks, AFL–L improves low-percentile client accuracy by 4−7 points and reduces communication volume by 1.8× compared to FedProx. Grounding prompts in cognitive semantics enables the LLM to bridge symbolic descriptors (reaction schemas, device layouts) and sub-symbolic representations, showing that meaning-aware conditioning—not mere token frequency—drives the observed gains. Finally, we sketch an extension toward a federation of heterogeneous expert models, where secure aggregation can combine updates from specialized LLMs or surrogate genetic-algorithm experts without compromising convergence or privacy guarantees.},

Using PHIL offers significant advantages, such as reducing the risk of equipment damage and personal injury. In particular, the absence of a battery cell is a clear advantage regarding required safety measures. Additionally, it shortens development and testing cycles, as system testing can commence before the final hardware is available. The presented testing approach involves two physical battery modules, each with its real hardware module converters and control systems, but with emulated batteries. The remaining modules of the battery string are emulated using a wide-band power supply controlled by an OPAL-RT real-time simulator. The system also includes physical string controllers and a system master controller, with the string controller somewhat adapted to interface with the real-time simulator. During the PHIL testing phase, numerous minor and major software faults were identified and resolved early in the process. Furthermore, the control functionalities of a hybrid high-energy and high-power battery concept were tested and validated. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of integrating real and emulated battery modules with distributed converters within the same string of a multilevel converter in a PHIL test bench. It addresses the challenges and necessary adaptations for such a configuration.},

To address this, we propose three model-based techniques for real-time estimation of invisible mental states of humans. Each method adapts the extended Kalman filter and incorporates a validated dynamic model of human mental states. These mental state estimators are designed for human-robot social interactions and personalize their parameters using initial user data. When tested with 10 human participants interacting with a NAO robot, the mental state estimators reduced the average error in estimation and prediction of mental states across all participants by 3% (i.e., from 12% to 9%), with improvements of up to 13% for individual participants. These results demonstrate the potential of integrating such state estimators into the behavioral control systems of social robots to enhance their awareness of the mental states of users.},

  abstract     = {In an increasingly digitized marketplace, traditional marketing models struggle to capture the complexity of evolving consumer behaviors and multi-channel interactions. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel computational framework that combines probabilistic modeling with dynamic decision-making to enhance marketing analytics. Central to this approach is the proposed Stochastic Market Graph Embedding Model (SMGEM), which captures both latent consumer states and their behavioral responses to marketing stimuli over time. By embedding consumer interactions within a dynamic graph structure, SMGEM effectively models short-term responsiveness and long-term engagement patterns, while accounting for exogenous market influences and peer effects. To operationalize this model in real-time environments, we implement the Adaptive Market Response Integration (AMRI) strategy. AMRI leverages reinforcement learning principles and streaming data assimilation to continuously update marketing policies, enabling context-aware and personalized interventions. The strategic framework integrates structural constraints such as budget limits, marketing fatigue, and coordinated targeting, ensuring that campaign actions are not only effective but also interpretable and aligned with organizational goals. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets—spanning segmentation, influence modeling, ROI attribution, and brand perception—demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models in both predictive accuracy and robustness. The modular design of the system also supports explainability and flexible deployment in real-world marketing infrastructures. Together, SMGEM and AMRI represent a significant step toward intelligent, scalable, and responsive marketing systems that align with the broader goals of computational and data-driven decision-making. Despite its architectural complexity, the framework maintains low-latency inference and high throughput, making it feasible for real-time deployment with measurable improvements in campaign effectiveness.},

It reduces the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of hardware and computational facilities while enabling high-speed tunability, reconfigurability, and low-latency computing for beamforming and spectrum sensing. Photonics is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation wireless innovation as 6G moves closer to THz and AI-driven networks. Therefore, this paper presents a novel low-complexity, partially connected photonic hybrid beamforming architecture designed to generate multiple analog beams. Unlike conventional radio frequency domain hybrid beamforming methods that utilize a single analog beam employing phase shifters, our proposed architecture relies on multiple photonic precoders for downlink transmission. This architecture utilizes programmable single-fed serially connected true time delay lines (TDLs) that are capable of generating multiple independently tunable time delays, capable of avoiding the beam-squint effect inherent in phase shifter-based beamforming. This photonic-based configuration provides notable improvement in spectral efficiency with the same number of RF chains as the conventional architecture. Besides, the utilization of independently tunable delays provided by the single line-fed true time delay line reduces hardware complexity and energy consumption compared to conventional RF domain hybrid beamforming, which employs analog phase shifters.},

In this work, we propose a dual-band, tunable metasurface biosensor based on graphene that could be used for early in-vivo skin cancer detection. The sensor is designed to operate at two resonance frequencies: 1.092 THz and 3.18 THz. The double Debye framework was used to model optical properties of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The sensor's performance on the test sample showed a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 48 GHz and a resonance shift of 36 GHz. The sensitivity, figure of merit (FOM), detection limit and quality factor (Q) are found to be 0.2389 THz/RIU, 4.93 RIU−1, and 21.7, 0.19 RIU respectively. Tunability of the sensor is obtained by varying graphene’s chemical potential or Fermi voltage from 0.8 to 1 eV. The design of biosensor was simulated in CST Microwave Studio, and its equivalent circuit model was developed.

Specifically, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) achieves 96.52% accuracy on MFCCs, and performs with 90% when a new label is introduced, while MobileNet attains 97.91% on spectrograms, followed by 92.77% after adding a new label. These findings underscore the effectiveness of EWC in heart sound classification, making it a promising approach for real-world applications that require continual learning.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue continues to be a leading contributor to global road accidents, posing significant risks particularly in long-distance, night-time, and commercial driving contexts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion, and signal processing have led to the development of automated fatigue detection systems capable of providing early warnings to prevent collisions. However, the field remains fragmented in terms of data modalities, modeling techniques, evaluation standards, and deployment readiness. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 78 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2025, critically analyzing the use of behavioral, physiological, vehicular, and multimodal approaches for fatigue detection. The review identifies a clear methodological shift from handcrafted features and traditional machine learning toward deep learning models, particularly CNNs and hybrid CNN-LSTM frameworks, enhancing performance in visual and EEG-based fatigue detection. Despite high accuracies reported under controlled conditions (often exceeding 95%), only a minority of models were validated in real-world settings or evaluated for real-time, in-vehicle deployability. Explainability and personalization, essential for trust and usability in human-centered AI, were substantially underrepresented which featured in only 19.2% and 12.8% of the studies respectively. Moreover, the widespread use of small sample sizes, unimodal data, and non-standardized metrics impedes reproducibility and comparative analysis. Nonetheless, emerging trends such as federated learning, edge deployment, and privacy-preserving AI indicate a growing emphasis on ethical, scalable, and context-aware systems. This review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research: emphasizing multimodal integration, standardized evaluation, on-road validation, and transparent model architectures, to bridge the gap between experimental prototypes and real-world fatigue monitoring systems.},

  abstract     = {Effective deployment of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) is essential for the success of Europe’s energy transition. However, there are no clear criteria for sharing energy generation among community members, which conditions the rhythm of RECs penetration. The lack of transversal legislation gave rise to different approaches in EU countries for solving this issue, with the calculation of ’a priori’ and ’a posteriori’ energy sharing coefficients being the most extended ones. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to develop better optimization algorithms to make the most of RECs, to minimize the surplus of energy, and improve payback among end-users and their impact on the energy system. This paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art and proposes improvements to the linear programming (LP) methodologies devoted to obtaining an optimal calculation of renewable sharing coefficients; able to provide satisfactory results, no matter the size of the REC, while consuming affordable computation resources. The performance of the proposed method has been validated using real generation and consumption data collected from a Spanish DSO, considering both ’a priori’ and ’a posteriori’ remuneration schemes. The results prove the good behaviour of the proposed solution for different REC sizes and operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {The growing need for digitally preserving the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities has positioned the accurate segmentation and innovative utilization of traditional patterns as a pivotal challenge in both technological and cultural preservation domains. To tackle this challenge, a novel method for segmenting low-resolution batik patterns (MAR-Net) is proposed, and its potential applications in cultural and creative product design are investigated. Specifically, an adaptive rectangular convolution (ARConv) mechanism is incorporated into the conventional U-Net architecture to effectively capture the intricate and diverse texture features of batik patterns, while the AR-Net network is developed to facilitate improved feature extraction and the integration of local and global information. To further enhance segmentation precision, a mask attention mechanism (MaskAttention) is utilized to strengthen the network’s focus on critical regions, thereby improving detail restoration and pattern segmentation through dynamic adjustment of feature weights. To improve the model’s robustness and discriminative capacity, a composite loss function is formulated, integrating pixel-level cross-entropy loss with instance-contrast-based attention loss to enhance the discriminative power of the feature space. In terms of application, accurately segmented batik patterns are converted into resources for cultural and creative product design, and a digital batik pattern resource library is created, with the potential for incorporating traditional patterns into the AIGC creation process being explored. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAR-Net method not only markedly enhances precision in low-resolution pattern segmentation tasks but also exhibits substantial potential for application in cultural and creative product design, offering a novel solution for the digital preservation and innovative utilization of batik patterns, thereby significantly contributing to the study and preservation of traditional ethnic minority arts.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) plays a pivotal role across diverse sectors—including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and defense—by capturing rich spectral information that enables fine-grained material discrimination. Despite its advantages, the inherently high dimensionality and complexity of hyperspectral data present substantial challenges for reliable anomaly detection. Conventional approaches often fall short when confronted with subtle or context-dependent anomalies, underscoring the need for more advanced methodologies. In this study, we propose the Enhanced Spectral Graph Transformer Network (ESGTN), a novel framework that synergistically combines graph-based modeling, transformer architectures, and hyperbolic space embedding to improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectral anomaly detection. By representing HSIs as graphs, ESGTN effectively models both spatial and spectral relationships. The transformer component, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, adaptively emphasizes salient features, while the incorporation of hyperbolic embeddings provides a compact and distortion-minimized representation of the data’s hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that ESGTN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior precision, recall, and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the model’s robustness and practical applicability across a range of real-world scenarios. Moreover, this work contributes to the growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging, offering a scalable path forward for tackling the complex analytical demands inherent to high-dimensional remote sensing data.},

  abstract     = {Axial-field flux-switching permanent-magnet machine (AFFSPMM) is an outstanding topology for sustainable applications. This structure encompasses several advantageous features, including compact volume, high power and torque density, worthy rigidity, and a separate assembly. These attributes have rendered this type of machine an optimal choice for the mentioned purpose as well as electric transportation. The use of a permanent magnet (PM) in this type of machine can lead to the production of cogging torque (COT), which is due to the saliency of the stator and rotor parts. This phenomenon has led to concerns among machine researchers and designers regarding the presence of noise, vibration, torque ripple, and speed fluctuations. This drawback can be mitigated either in design and structural considerations or in control and excitation methods. The complexity and commercial concerns are the main motives for focusing on the machine parts modification rather than the control aspects. In this paper, first, a brief statement of the design procedure, the essence of COT, and the problem statement are introduced. An in-depth review of various design strategies aimed at reducing COT is then presented. Consequently, a comprehensive comparison is presented, including an evaluation of the advantages, disadvantages, cost, complexity, and other relevant factors, to help researchers, designers, and manufacturers select the most appropriate strategies for each application considering the requirements. The review not only involves the key achievements of the topologies, but also provides insight into the methodologies where the Finite Element Method (FEM) and experimental results authenticate the effectiveness. Indeed, the IEEE standard 1812-2023 considered to measure COT in both dynamic and static modes.},

Unlike prior approaches that treat the team as a homogeneous unit, we introduced the Victory Contribution (VC) metric to quantify individual player impact across four strategic domains—offense, defense, laning, and gold acquisition—while accounting for positional roles. Using professional match data from 10,390 games across three global leagues in 2023 and an independent test set of 9,670 matches from 2024, we trained four classification models—logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost (XGB)—on 13 selected features, both with and without the VC metric. Across all classifiers, extended models incorporating VC consistently outperformed baseline models. On the test set, the XGB model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 0.8686, recall of 0.8084, F1-score of 0.8601, and AUC of 0.9512. VC also outperformed traditional metrics such as Damage Share (DS) and Kill Participation (KP), yielding higher test recall and F1-score than both. All observed performance improvements were statistically significant across evaluation metrics (p < 0.0001). Cross-league analysis revealed no significant differences in positional VC ratios, suggesting structural consistency in role contributions across Legends Champions Korea (LCK), Legends European Championship (LEC), and Legends Championship Series (LCS). These findings demonstrate the practical value of incorporating role-aware metrics in predictive modeling and player evaluation in professional esports.},

Deep Residual Networks (DRNs) have emerged as a promising architecture for STLF, offering a balanced solution by combining training stability, deep feature extraction, and reduced gradient degradation compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. This study focuses on optimizing DRN for STLF by evaluating different combinations of multidimensional weather variables and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address feature complexity. Using the Malaysia dataset, which includes historical load, time, and weather variables such as temperature, rainfall, and wind speed, the impact of different variable combinations on forecasting precision is evaluated. Experimental results show that the DRN model outperforms baseline models including CNNs, RNN-based models, and Transformers, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.052514 and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.927993. Building upon this, the proposed PCA-DRN further improves forecasting performance, achieving a MAPE of 0.049994 and an R² of 0.934473, representing a 4.80% reduction in MAPE and a 0.65% increase in R² compared to the original DRN.

To address this limitation and build on our previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments. Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.},

  abstract     = {Health indicators (HIs) are measures that consolidate complex machinery characteristics into a single dimension and have been extensively studied for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL). Recent research has proposed HI-prediction models based on recursive cell structures that demonstrate promising performance. However, recent cell structures have limitations, such as saturation in hidden states and difficulty learning interdependent patterns among various components. Accurate RUL predictions require minimizing error accumulation in the recursive HI-prediction process, which can be achieved using a cell structure capable of capturing interdependent patterns. This study proposes a new cell structure termed the trend-fluctuation correlated attention unit (TFCAU) that employs a gate mechanism to capture interactions between divided trends and fluctuations in HI and an attention mechanism for robust long-term predictions. The superiority of the TFCAU was validated using a bearing dataset from the PRONOSTIA platform and a real-world dataset from the Korean weapons system. Comparative experiments using six sub-datasets demonstrated that TFCAU outperformed the state-of-the-art model—the gated transient fluctuation dual-attention unit—achieving a 169.37% improvement in the score metric and a reduction of 49.93 units in the mean-absolute error. An extensive ablation study experimentally confirmed that the TFCAU effectively captured the interdependent characteristics between trends and fluctuations. TFCAU delivered excellent performance for both rotating and non-rotating systems, suggesting its potential applicability across multiple operational scenarios.},

Traditional evaluation methods often fall short. This study presents ZCASNet, a new hybrid model for automated evaluation of AI-generated short films based on several significant indicators like visual coherence, scene rationality, detail reality, temporal consistency. In ZCASNet framework, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, is applied to extract spatial features from video frames. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) captures semantic and temporal relationships across frames. The Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) enhances the CNN-MHA architecture by refining hyperparameters to improve its performance. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to classify the optimized features. Our experiments show that ZCASNet outperforms baseline models, including CNN-only, CNN with MHA, Transformer models, and standard SVM. ZCASNet achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, demonstrating notable performance. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the RBF kernel function and each module in the model architecture. Overall, ZCASNet offers an effective and interpretable solution for evaluation in AI-generated video.

  abstract     = {With the arrival of Industry 4.0, manufacturing execution system (MES) as the core bridge connecting enterprise management and production workshop, its data processing capability directly affects the operational efficiency of enterprises. Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {As the only technology that can support kilometer-level underwater communications, the UnderWater Acoustic Communications (UWAC) suffers from low data rate which is unable to support various emerging marine applications. The recently proposed acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (aRIS) has been considered to have the ability to improve the data rate and the coverage of UWAC systems, since it can control the direction of acoustic signal propagation and realize beamforming. The deployment of aRIS is critical to realize its data rate and coverage enhancement capabilities. However, how to optimize the aRIS deployment in deep-sea long-range scenarios has not been studied. To fill in this gap, a transmission loss (TL) model for aRIS-aided UWAC systems is established in this paper, where the beamforming gain and signal amplification gain of aRIS are characterized. Then, based on the TL model, a deep sound channel axis focusing (DSCAF) deployment architecture is proposed and analyzed for aRIS-aided UWAC systems in deep-sea long-range scenarios. In the proposed architecture, one aRIS each is deployed near the transmitter and receiver at the depth of the deep sound channel axis. By utilizing the beamforming capability of aRISs, the proposed DSCAF deployment architecture can guide acoustic signals into and out of the deep sound channel. This will ensure the transmission is fully concentrated in the deep sound channel, thus reducing the TL and enhancing the coverage in a distant receiving area. The analysis proves that the proposed scheme enjoys asymptotic optimality of TL as the number of aRIS elements increases compared to deploying aRISs at other depths. Simulation results have illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce the TL and improve the spectrum efficiency in a long-distance receiving area.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommendation (SR) systems based on users’ past behavior sequences are widely used on online platforms to provide personalized suggestions effectively. Transformer-based SR models have demonstrated remarkable success by effectively learning the correlations between individual items in users’ item sequences. Although transformer-based SR models perform well overall, they often fail to capture changes in local trends within long interaction sequences, since they primarily deal with sequences on a global scale. Recently, various methods have been proposed to address this issue by emphasizing local preference information. However, these approaches focus solely on enhancing local preference information, often overlooking the transition information between local preferences. Consequently, they struggle to effectively represent dynamic user behavior sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-level learning framework for sequential recommendation called Patching Sequential Recommendation (PSR), which introduces patch sequences derived from local groups of items within original item sequences. The PSR method uses both patch sequences and item sequences as training samples, allowing for simultaneous training at the individual item level and patch level. Moreover, the proposed framework employs a user representation alignment module to improve user representation by aligning users’ item and patch sequence embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/kangvic0615/PSR.},

However, the dynamic nature of vehicular networks introduces significant challenges to service placement strategies due to the tension between fluid network topologies and static resource allocations. Specifically, three critical issues arise: (1) the spatial mobility of vehicles causes pronounced spatiotemporal variability in edge service demands; (2) the fixed nature of edge services limits the elasticity of service provisioning; and (3) persistent risks of node failures, stemming from hardware faults or software errors, jeopardize service continuity. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fault-tolerant service placement model that jointly optimizes latency minimization and load balancing.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the aging population, which is expected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, poses profound challenges for healthcare systems and quality of life of the elderly. Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. Although studies have explored the adaptation of DTs technology for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, significant gaps remain in comprehensive data integration, advanced predictive capabilities, and underutilization of Generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time support, limiting support for caregivers in elderly care. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that integrates diverse real-time physiological data to enhance personalized healthcare. The feasibility and applicability of the framework were validated by developing a cardiac DT incorporating real-time monitoring, prediction, and analysis of heart rate (HR), heart rate zone (HRZ), sleep quality DT model, and SpO2 monitoring DT model. Advanced predictive modeling demonstrated high accuracy, with LSTM achieving a 92% validation accuracy in predicting sleep levels. Bi-LSTM demonstrated robust performance in real-time HR (BPM) prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.2944 and MAE of 0.3410. The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision making and elderly self-management. This study contributes to advancing DT technology by creating an interpretable, scalable system for proactive elderly care, and sets the stage for future research into multiorgan digital twins and broader clinical deployment.},

This study addresses these issues by proposing an EfficientNet B0 architecture enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve classification accuracy and interpretability across multiple X-ray datasets: FracAtlas, Knee, and Lung X-ray. A robust preprocessing pipeline comprising LAB color space conversion, morphological filtering, gamma correction, Non-Local Means denoising, resizing, and normalization was applied to optimize image quality, with each step’s effectiveness verified through established image quality metrics. Additionally, geometric augmentation techniques were performed to increase dataset variability and improve model generalization. Comparative experiments with transfer learning, transformer-based, and attention-based models identified the attention-based EfficientNet B0 as the best performer. An extensive ablation study on the Knee X-ray dataset refined hyperparameters to maximize performance. The optimized model achieved high test accuracies of 98.09%, 97.12%, and 99.51% on FracAtlas, Knee, and Lung datasets, respectively. Further analyses, including noise robustness testing, k-fold cross-validation, and Grad-CAM visualization, demonstrated the model’s resilience, consistency, and explainability. The findings highlight the critical role of attention mechanisms in enhancing feature representation and generalization across heterogeneous medical imaging tasks.

  abstract     = {Controlling lower limb exoskeletons presents substantial challenges due to the nonlinear dynamics of human gait and the need for adaptation to varying user requirements and environmental conditions. To address these challenges a fuzzy sliding mode Control (FSMC) strategy as an advanced hybrid control solution for a 2-DOF lower limb exoskeleton robot designed to assist dynamic walking has been proposed in this paper. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in the integration of fuzzy logic into the sliding mode control framework, where the fuzzy inference system dynamically adjusts the control gains based on real-time tracking errors and their rates of change. This adaptive mechanism enables FSMC to leverage the advantage of the high robustness of sliding mode control and the smooth response characteristics of fuzzy logic systems. The proposed FSMC was benchmarked against classical sliding mode control(SMC) and Quasi-SMC across multiple walking scenarios, including variations in walking speed and random stop-start motions. Unlike these SMC methods, which often struggle with nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, and gait variability, the proposed FSMC approach offers superior improved tracking and robustness outperforming both the classical SMC and Quasi-SMC. Across all gait scenarios normal, increased, and random FSMC consistently outperforms both conventional SMC and Quasi-SMC in chattering suppression while maintaining superior tracking precision. Key performance metrics demonstrate FSMC’s dominance reduction in Chattering Index (CI), lower Total Variation (TV), and decrease in Chattering Energy Index (CEI), all while achieving better tracking accuracy with lower Integral Square error(ISE). The system’s ability to reduce chattering further supports its suitability for applications where energy efficiency and reduced mechanical wear are critical.},

To address these issues, we propose a lightweight wireless image transmission method based on a tiny ConvNeXt architecture (ConvNeXt-T), referred to as DeepJSCC-T. To reduce the system’s parameter size and storage requirements, to achieve a lightweight design, and to enable adaptability to varying bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we incorporate the efficient and lightweight ConvNeXt-T as the new backbone network for JSCC in the system’s architecture. Additionally, we design a lightweight SNR-adaptive module based on large convolutional kernels to further enhance the system’s adaptability and performance. The experimental results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed DeepJSCC-T achieves significant reductions in both parameter size and storage overhead. Specifically, DeepJSCC-T reduces the number of parameters by 24.65% and 27.52% relative to the Attention-based DeepJSCC (ADJSCC) and the variable-length DeepJSCC (DeepJSCC-V), while lowering storage overhead by 30.98% and 33.47%, respectively. Notably, despite its more compact architecture, DeepJSCC-T maintains competitive PSNR performance, demonstrates clear advantages in high-resolution image transmission, and exhibits strong adaptability under different SNR and bandwidth conditions, making it suitable for resource-constrained semantic communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In underwater sensor networks, the use of acoustic waves with large propagation delays and narrow channel bandwidth poses significant challenges for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols in reducing the number of retransmissions caused by packet collisions at the receiver node, thereby improving channel throughput. When packet collisions occur, the transmitting node enters a waiting state and will retransmit the packet at an appropriate time. However, if a node retransmits the packet at inappropriate times, it can lead to further collisions in subsequent transmission attempts. To reduce the number of retransmissions caused by collisions and improve channel throughput, in this study, we propose a Hybrid MAC protocol that combines asynchronous contention-free MAC with Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) and synchronous Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC protocols, along with an ARQ strategy applied to underwater communication channels, called the ARQ_HMAC (Automatic Repeat reQuest Strategy for Hybrid MAC) strategy. In the ARQ_HMAC protocol, when a node has a packet to transmit, it senses the channel state and operates according to the Contention-Free MAC protocol. If a packet collision occurs, the node switches to a waiting state and retransmits the packet using the TDMA protocol. The waiting time and the TDMA schedule are calculated based on the ARQ_HMAC strategy to avoid collisions in subsequent retransmission attempts.

  abstract     = {Fake comments pose a significant challenge for e-commerce by manipulating customer perception and harming legitimate business. We propose a novel approach using recurrent neural networks to detect anomalies in user behavior patterns. We model user activity on Cafebazaar e-commerce as a multivariate time series and employ a long short-term memory auto-encoder to determine periods of abnormal activities. By incorporating our model with existing methods, we observe significant improvement in the detection accuracy of fraudulent users, reaching 99 percent precision with the dataset. Our proposed model can improve other fake comment detection methods, especially if they suffer from a cold start problem with little information about the majority of users. The proposed system is implemented in a real-life application and has successfully removed 1.9 million fake comments from the Cafebazaar platform. We also provide a new dataset for fake comment detection that researchers can use to evaluate existing methods or develop new approaches.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems. Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder (AE)-based system. To improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper bounds of the sensing and communication performance. The NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to address the improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments (UEs). Our contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR conditions.},

The trajectory tracking error of the three-degree-of-freedom robot manipulating arm has been controlled and eliminated in this study using SMC with adaptive fuzzy control. In order to adjust the sliding surface gain parameter and help it converge and stay at zero, the adaptive fuzzy logic control system and the direct method of the Lyapunov stability of the robot manipulator has been applied.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly prominent in critical operations across various fields, including defense, agriculture, and logistics. Propeller damages and loosening of rotor screws in these systems pose significant threats to flight safety and disrupt operational continuity. In the literature, these two fault types have typically been analyzed separately using conventional methods based on either vibration or acoustic signals; however, a comprehensive study that simultaneously detects both faults on acoustic data using a hybrid deep learning-based model has not been reported. In this study, a hybrid model combining Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been developed using acoustic signals recorded via a microphone. The proposed model differs from traditional approaches based on Fourier-domain amplitude/frequency features (e.g., SVM, Decision Tree), as well as from deep learning models that utilize Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) or spectrogram features in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, it employs WST to extract multi-resolution, phase-aware, and deformation-stable features, which are then processed by an LSTM network. The model was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 750 one-second acoustic segments, approximately balanced across three fault classes through stratified sampling and cross-validation. A data split of 75% training, 15% validation, and 10% testing was employed for model development and evaluation. By integrating time–frequency-based multi-layered features into a time-sequential deep learning framework, the proposed model enables the simultaneous detection of both propeller damages and rotor screw looseness, reaching a high accuracy of 98.93%.. This approach offers an innovative perspective for acoustic-based fault detection in UAV systems and makes a significant contribution to enhancing operational safety.},

  abstract     = {Human pose estimation reconstructs 3D human joint positions from monocular images or videos, enabling applications in healthcare, sports, AR/VR, and animation. The challenge lies in depth ambiguity, temporal coherence, and complex motion patterns. Recent deep learning advancements, such as SMPLs, GCNs, and Transformers, have improved estimation precision. Most techniques evaluate poses in 2D before converting them to 3D, often ignoring temporal dynamics and encountering depth ambiguity, resulting in multiple 3D poses from a single 2D setup. While GCNs are effective for joint interactions, their dependence on pre-defined graph structures limits their capacity to capture global dependencies and adapt to varying joint configurations. To address these limitations, we proposed PRAMGraphConv, a novel graph convolution approach that dynamically models joint relationships. It is characterized by an expert routing block that dynamically assigns importance weights and alters joint relational patterns in an adaptable manner. Furthermore, the model enhances its ability to capture intricate, non-local linkages while maintaining processing efficiency, addressing depth ambiguity, and scaling issues, through the incorporation of an ANModGCN. We integrate these components into PRAMGCN-Net, a unified framework to achieve robust performance in challenging occluded scenarios. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, HumanEva, and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in 3D human pose estimation, while maintaining high accuracy with an efficient, lightweight architecture.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by vehicular engine systems has necessitated the development of efficient frameworks for real-time big data processing. Existing solutions such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, have been widely adopted in various domains due to their respective strengths; Hadoop’s distributed storage capabilities and Spark’s in-memory processing efficiency. However, these standalone frameworks present limitations when applied to vehicular systems, particularly in handling real-time analytics, low-latency requirements, and efficient use of network and energy resources. Previous research, including approaches like the one by [1], which combines Spark with Hadoop YARN for remote sensing data, and [2], which investigates parameter tuning for Hadoop and Spark, highlights the difficulties in achieving optimal performance in dynamic environments, particularly when managing varying data loads, noise levels, and non-numeric attributes. This paper introduces a novel Optimized Hybrid Framework that integrates Hadoop’s distributed storage and Spark’s in-memory processing while addressing the limitations of existing hybrid models. Unlike prior approaches, our framework incorporates a dynamic switching mechanism based on business logic, data urgency, and noise levels, providing an adaptive and efficient solution for real-time vehicular big data analytics. Moreover, the framework introduces controlled noise injection strategies and special handling for non-numeric attributes such as decision and driver behavior data, ensuring data integrity in real-world vehicular datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Framework outperforms both Hadoop and Spark in key performance metrics, achieving an execution time of 0.030 seconds, latency of 1.67e-7 seconds/row, and a network load of 55.01%. These results highlight the framework’s ability to optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce energy consumption, making it particularly suitable for predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and adaptive vehicular control systems. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, scalable, and low-latency solution for vehicular big data analytics, addressing the shortcomings of both standalone and hybrid approaches in the automotive manufacturers domain, fleet operators, and researchers for a more effective tool for vehicle health monitoring. The enhanced data processing capabilities facilitate better vehicle maintenance, increase safety, and reduce operational costs, delivering substantial benefits to the broader community through more dependable and efficient transportation solution.},

  abstract     = {Birds represent an important component of ecosystems, holding substantial ecological and human interest, and significantly contributing to ecological equilibrium via their roles as pollinators, seed dispensers, and predators. If identified correctly, the wild life departments, farmers, ecologists, and various other experts can ensure saving endangered bird species, improving crop yield and ensure seed safety, and plan safe sanctuaries for birds, etc. Due to the vast array of bird species and the often subtle distinctions among them, human-driven manual classification poses a formidable challenge. The manual classification of bird species is a labor-intensive and error-prone process, predominantly reliant on domain experts. However recent algorithmic developments and progress in the deep-learning based object detection and classification models has made this difficult and time-consuming task easy and accurate. Nevertheless, numerous existing CNN models have been trained or fine-tuned on limited datasets, rendering them ill-equipped to handle the classification of a substantial volume of diverse bird species. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel approach based on transfer learning and the ResNet-50 model to ensure accurate identification of endangered species. Our methodology involved fine-tuning the ResNet-50 model on the 100 Bird Species dataset, with the training data consisting of 85,000 images, representing 525 distinct bird species with each species comprising of 130 or more diverse pre-processed images, including 25 endangered and 12 critically endangered species. The transfer learning based mechanism applied on the large dataset achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 87% in bird species classification through deep learning. Our results showed that out of 12 critically endangered species like California condor, Ashy storm petrel, California quail and other quails, none is misclassified by our system. Similarly, none of the 25 endangered species is misclassified by our system, indicating a solid performance for use in identification of endangered and critically endangered bird species. This study shows that deep learning and transfer learning can be successfully deployed to identify birds, and ensure the safety of endangered and critically endangered species of birds, making it a powerful and adaptable approach for the future.},

Traditional supervised machine learning methods have shown promise in this domain but suffer from limited generalizability, high labeling costs, and overfitting. Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) offer new opportunities for effective requirement classification through zero-shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) learning. This study investigates the effectiveness of ZS and FS PLMs, including prompt-based generative large language models (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3), in classifying functional vs. non-functional requirements and non-functional subtypes, such as usability, security, operational, and performance requirements.We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five classification tasks using two widely adopted datasets: PROMISE and SecReq. The study compares six PLMs, including two ZS, two FS transformer models, and two generative Large Language Models under both ZS and FS settings. We benchmark these models against state-of-the-art and domain-specific baselines, and complement the quantitative analysis with a detailed qualitative error analysis. FS models, such as All-MPNET, All-DistilRoBERTa, and GPT-4o in the FS setting, consistently outperform ZS models across all tasks, achieving superior performance in multi-class NFR and security requirement classification. While NoRBERT remains superior in binary FR/NFR classification, our FS models outperform or match its performance in other scenarios. ZS models, such as GPT-4o, also demonstrate strong results without requiring training data, highlighting their practical utility. Error analysis reveals that annotation issues and lack of context are major sources of misclassification. Our findings establish that ZS and FS PLMs, especially prompt-based generative large language models, offer viable and scalable alternatives to traditional supervised approaches. This study lays the foundation for the broader adoption of prompt-based PLMs in requirement engineering.},

The system integrates a minimally invasive drive-by-wire interface for throttle, braking, and steering; a GNSS-based localization module; and a lightweight perception suite comprising a 2D LiDAR and a monocular camera. A modular ROS2-based architecture supports real-time perception, planning, and control. The platform was tested on an off-road track in Brazil across eight driving scenarios, including straight paths, curves, and obstacle avoidance at varying speeds. A spatial evaluation framework was implemented using arc-length reparameterization and KD-Tree nearest-neighbor matching to compare actual and reference trajectories. Metrics included lateral and heading RMSE, IAE, ITAE, jerk, and obstacle clearance. Results showed consistent high lateral tracking accuracy, with RMSE reaching 0.15 m in straight segments and remaining below 1.0 m in most complex scenarios. Scenario T8, involving curvature and obstacle deviation, surpassed this threshold due to increased control demands. Across 40 runs, heading RMSE remained below 10°, obstacle clearance above 1.5 m, and jerk below 0.5 m/s³. Geometrically modeled references yielded more stable heading control, while manually recorded paths resulted in smoother dynamic profiles. Statistical analysis confirmed that increased trajectory complexity degrades performance. Scenario T6 outperformed others in lateral stability, though results were statistically like T1 under simpler conditions. The platform demonstrated reliable tracking and real-time operation in scenarios representative of off-road agricultural tasks. Future work will focus on mitigating GNSS latency, improving post-obstacle recovery, and integrating sensor redundancy and adaptive planning to enhance deployment in agricultural logistics.},

  abstract     = {Embedded systems serve as the foundation for modern computing in industrial, IoT, and defense applications. However, their increased adoption exposes them to security threats across multiple levels, from application software to operating systems and hardware. Traditional security mechanisms often focus on a single layer, missing cross-layer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sophisticated attacks. This paper introduces a unified multi-layer vulnerability detection framework that integrates software, operating system, and hardware-level security analysis into a single LLAMA3-based deep learning model. The framework leverages a combined dataset consisting of source code vulnerabilities (C programming), Linux Kernel exploits (system calls), and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware security risks in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and bitstream analysis. By merging these diverse vulnerability types into a single learning model, the framework is capable of detecting security threats across the entire embedded system stack. Applying static and dynamic analysis techniques across multiple layers, the proposed LLAMA3-based model achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy across embedded system security domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated framework outperforms existing layer-specific models, achieving 99.30% accuracy for software vulnerabilities, 99.16% accuracy for OS-level exploits, and 95.6% accuracy for hardware security threats.},

  abstract     = {Object navigation remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly when agents must reach targets specified by semantic categories. While existing approaches often treat semantic understanding and navigation as separate components, we demonstrate that their tight coupling is crucial for robust performance. We present SegDT (Segmenting Decision Transformer), a novel architecture that jointly learns to predict semantic segmentation masks and navigation actions through a unified transformer-based model. Our key insight is that temporal information from sequential observations can simultaneously enhance both segmentation quality and navigation decisions. To address the inherent challenges of transformer-based navigation—notably poor sample efficiency and computational complexity—we introduce a two-phase training approach: offline pretraining on expert demonstrations followed by online policy refinement through knowledge transfer from a recurrent neural network. Extensive experiments in the Habitat simulator demonstrate that SegDT achieves higher results using predicted segmentation masks, outperforming single-frame baseline with pre-trained semantic segmentation model and approaching the performance of systems using ground truth semantic information. Our ablation studies reveal that SegDT’s temporal processing also improves segmentation quality, highlighting the synergistic benefits of joint optimization. When integrated into complete object navigation systems, SegDT enhances overall performance by 9.6% in path efficiency compared to state-of-the-art method. The code of SegDT is made publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/SegDT.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image super-resolution faces significant challenges, including detail loss, sensor noise, and atmospheric interference that compromise image quality for critical applications. Current deep learning approaches struggle with three key limitations: insufficient multi-scale feature extraction, inadequate attention to crucial image regions, and poor preservation of refined spatial details during reconstruction. We propose HybridATNet, a novel CNN-Transformer architecture that addresses these limitations through three primary innovations. First, our shallow feature extraction integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), Multi-scale Spatial Attention (MSA), and Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (RASPP) to capture features across multiple scales in both channel and spatial domains. Second, we employ an Activated Sparsely Sub-Pixel Transformer (ASSPT) for deep feature extraction that efficiently captures long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency through a novel sparse attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to approximately O(n log n). Third, we introduce a dual-domain approach that combines multi-scale spatial refinement with frequency-domain processing to preserve structural details while simultaneously reducing high-frequency noise. Extensive experiments on the UCMerced and AID datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple scale factors (×2, ×3, ×4), achieving PSNR improvements of up to 0.26dB on the UCMerced dataset and 0.13dB on the larger AID dataset. Visual comparisons confirm superior preservation of fine details and improved noise reduction, particularly in complex structural regions. HybridATNet delivers high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational efficiency, requiring approximately 15% fewer parameters and 18% fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than other transformer-based models, making it well-suited for practical remote sensing applications.},

Traditional approaches, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based models such as Deep Q-Networks, often suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability, limiting their applicability in large and dynamic environments. This paper introduces AAPDEM, an Automated Attack Path Discovery and Exploitation Model, which integrates real-time network scanning, structured vulnerability analysis, and heuristic pathfinding to address these limitations. AAPDEM constructs attack graphs based on discovered vulnerabilities and employs a cost-aware A* search algorithm to identify optimal attack paths. This eliminates the need for model training while significantly reducing memory and processing overhead. The framework adapts efficiently to network changes by incrementally updating only the affected portions of the graph, maintaining high accuracy and responsiveness. Comprehensive experiments were conducted across various network scales using real-world vulnerability data. AAPDEM was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including Random Walk, Greedy Search, Genetic Algorithms, and DRL-based approaches. Results show that AAPDEM consistently achieves higher path accuracy—improving up to 12%—while reducing execution time by 35% on average. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong resilience in dynamic environments by maintaining stability across fluctuating vulnerability conditions. Overall, AAPDEM offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for automated penetration testing, equipping cybersecurity professionals with a practical tool for attack path discovery and risk assessment in evolving network infrastructures.},

Recently, state space models have demonstrated great potential in image restoration tasks, offering advantages in global information modeling while maintaining low computational complexity. However, we observe that existing Mamba-based image dehazing methods rely on a fixed-scale spatial-aware scanning mechanism, which presents limitations when applied to complex remote sensing scenarios characterized by objects and features at varying spatial scales. In this paper, we propose an effective scale-aggregation content-driven state space model for remote sensing image dehazing, called SC-DehazeMamba. Specifically, the proposed framework integrates both coarse-to-fine and multi-patch strategies into a unified parallel multi-branch architecture, where each branch leverages multi-scale learning to enhance robustness against diverse degradation appearances. In addition, we design a content-driven dynamic adaptive scanning mechanism that can adaptively determine the scanning order and regions based on the input remote sensing image. Through a series of extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets, our proposed framework has shown its effectiveness and favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis to ensure effective clinical management. This is particularly important in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), where neurological monitoring plays a key role in assistive and diagnostic applications. In this context, Electroencephalography (EEG) is the primary diagnostic modality; however, traditional manual analysis is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-expert variability. Automated machine learning techniques offer a promising alternative to manual EEG analysis. The opaque, "black-box" nature of many Machine Learning (ML) models often raise concerns about their reliability in clinical settings, which can hinder their practical implementation. To tackle this issue, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a transformative solution, providing greater transparency and shedding light on the critical features driving model predictions. In this study, we introduce Explainable LIME-based Selection of EEG Electrodes (XLISEE), a novel approach that not only enhances EEG channel selection but also strengthens interpretability by leveraging XAI methodologies. The suggested approach is evaluated using the dataset provided by Guinea-Bissau Hospital. The most important EEG channels are identified by XLISEE to differentiate between epileptics and healthy subjects, reducing data complexity without sacrificing the precision of the diagnosis.With accuracy rates of 99.76% for both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifiers, our experimental results show that the suggested method delivers remarkable classification performance. It also attains 100% accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score, as well as a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 1.0. Moreover, lower computational demands improve efficiency, making real-time epilepsy detection more practical and feasible for clinical use. Beyond performance gains, integrating XAI enhances clinician confidence by offering interpretable, evidence-based insights, promoting wider adoption of AI-driven diagnostics.},

Although machine learning (ML) algorithms promise better results, existing frameworks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in EEG data, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture of a prediction model that uses resting-state EEG data as input. This architecture synergistically combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), which enables accurate discrimination between poor and good prognosis of moTBI. The BiLSTM component extracts complex features from the EEG signals, while AdaBoost serves as a classifier discriminator, replacing the conventional softmax function to optimize performance. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model achieves impressive under the curve (AUC) performance of 99.51 ± 1.36% and 98.91 ± 2.47% for preprocessed and 98.91 ± 2.47% for unprocessed EEG sequences. Notably, the model outperforms conventional DL architectures and other hybrid models, showing improvements of up to 14.14% over DL-only models and 24.51% over traditional ML approaches. This innovative architecture of the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model represents a significant advance in EEG-based decision support systems for moTBI and rapid assessment of a potentially overlooked poor prognosis.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the total ionizing dose (TID) effect on the six-transistor static random access memory (6-T SRAM) consisting of a novel device, a nanosheet field effect transistor (NSFET). Via technology computer-aided design, we simulate the hold, read, and write static noise margin (HSNM, RSNM, and WSNM) degradations by the oxide trap, using stationary simulation. In the stationary simulation, the HSNM and RSNM decrease about 75% and bit flip occurs under the oxide trap conditions, respectively. The voltage stored at the VCH (VCL) node reduces owing to the leakage current of the pull-down (PD) transistors. The detail degradation mechanism for the SRAM operation (hold/read/write) problems due to the oxide trap is confirmed through the time-dependent simulations. In the read operations, the leakage current at PD transistors causes a bit flip of the CH node. Moreover, the CH node voltage decreases under hold and write operations (ΔVCH = 15.7% and 14%). Significantly, when the adjacent cell (word-line (WL)2) of the target cell (WL1) operates to write data (VBL down from VDD to 0), the voltage drop at the target cell (WL1) CH node (decreased by 23.3%) is enhanced under hold operation of the target cell. To mitigate the effects of oxide trap that cause electrical characteristic degradation in NSFET 6-T SRAM, we applied a partial dielectric isolation (PDI) structure that locally deposits an oxide (SiO2) on the bottom of the source/drain (S/D). SRAM cells incorporating the proposed PDI technique demonstrated that variations in SNM caused by oxide trap were suppressed to less than 1% across read, write, and hold operations. Additionally, through time-dependent electrical characteristic analysis, it was confirmed that the potential changes in Vch and Vcl converge 1% under various operation modes and adjacent cell activation conditions, thereby demonstrating the effective blocking of the effects of oxide trap occurring in the shallow trench isolation (STI) region.},

  abstract     = {Electronic cash (e-cash) systems must provide users with anonymity while preventing criminal misuse and enabling selective tracing of malicious actors, such as double-spenders. One of the most ingenious solutions, introduced by Chaum and Brands, involves deploying observers on users’ devices to enforce legitimate payment behavior without compromising anonymity. In this paper, we propose a novel e-cash scheme based on BBS+ signatures and open-source observers running within Attested Execution Secure Processors (AESPs). Our construction employs zero-knowledge proofs to conceal private information, while the open-source observer program—installed within a tamper-proof secure element—acts as a proactive gatekeeper, preventing double-spend attempts before they succeed. The AESP-based attestation mechanism binds each output to the program’s hash, guaranteeing that the officially vetted observer is indeed installed and operating unmodified on the user’s device. This scheme provides three key properties. First, it achieves anonymity and one-more unforgeability using a technique inspired by Brickell et al.’s EPID. Second, it ensures robust double-spend prevention and traceability of double-spenders, even if the AESP assumption is compromised. Third, the scheme remains reversible: if the observer is compromised, it gracefully reverts to the basic scheme without the observer, which preserves anonymity and unforgeability. Overall, this work bridges cryptographic privacy and practical regulatory oversight, providing a transparent and extensible foundation for secure digital payments.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is a critical challenge in credit scoring, where the dominance of majority class samples reduces predictive performance for minority instances. Traditional methods, such as SMOTE and random undersampling, attempt to rebalance datasets but often introduce synthetic noise or discard valuable data. This paper introduces Augmentation Based on Uncertainty and Difficulty (UDDA), a novel real-data augmentation framework that avoids both synthetic data generation and majority class removal. UDDA leverages a hybrid of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Active Learning (AL) to identify and prioritize real, informative, and difficult-to-classify samples. This approach enhances model robustness while preserving dataset integrity. Experimental evaluation on twenty benchmark imbalanced tabular datasets demonstrates that UDDA outperforms established methods, including SMOTE and undersampling, across key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. UDDA sets a new direction in imbalanced learning by offering a practical, interpretable, and effective solution for improving classification performance in credit scoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Ontology matching is a key technology for solving the problem of semantic heterogeneity between ontologies. In past years, scholars have proposed many approaches committed to improve the quality of ontology matching. In particular, the metaheuristics-based ontology meta-matching approaches have been proven to be able to achieve better results because it can adaptively combine multiple basic matchers according to application scenarios. However, beside quality, the execution efficiency of the system is also of great importance in dynamic applications. If the system’s response time is too long, it will lead to a decline for user experience and even abandonment. To address such issues, in this paper, a novel compact flow regime algorithm for improving the efficiency of metaheuristics-based ontology matching system is proposed, named CFRAOM. The proposed approach uses the probability representation of population behavior to avoid the algorithm consuming a lot of time and memory during the execution of matching, thereby improving the execution efficiency of the matching system. To demonstrate the efficiency and matching effectiveness of the proposed approach. The CFRAOM algorithm has been executed several large-scale ontology matching tasks and compared with other metaheuristic-based methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach not only improves the execution efficiency of the metaheuristic-based system but also achieves better matching quality.},

  abstract     = {As the demand for high-frequency (HF) radio platforms grows, existing HF systems are becoming increasingly contested by high levels of interference and traffic. Although many HF systems demonstrate robust performance against limited amounts of interference, their reliability degrades as greater numbers of users occupy the same transmission band. To improve reliability in these congested channel conditions, we propose a filter-bank based multicarrier spread-spectrum waveform with noncontiguous subcarrier bands. Using noncontiguous subcarrier bands enables the use of a robust, wideband system while retaining the frequency agility of a narrowband system. In this study, we modify a filter-bank transmitter structure to accommodate noncontiguous subcarrier bands and consider several immediate impacts of this change, such as elevated peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPRs). A receiver architecture to process the noncontiguous spread-spectrum signal is also introduced, along with details regarding wideband channel estimation. We develop efficient transceiver structures and study their complexity to support practical system implementations. We conclude by comparing the performance of contiguous and noncontiguous systems through both simulation and over-the-air testing. The results show that the noncontiguous system remains robust in typical HF channels while significantly outperforming the contiguous system in congested spectral conditions.},

  abstract     = {Classical Arabic (CA) presents unique and significant challenges for computational syntactic analysis, primarily due to its complex morphosyntax, pervasive ellipsis, flexible word order, and the critical scarcity of comprehensive annotated resources. This paper introduces Noor, a novel multi-stage pipeline framework specifically engineered for robust, high-performance syntactic parsing of CA. The Noor framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a dedicated pre-parsing module (TAQDIR) employing a hybrid rule-based and heuristic approach for explicit ellipsis resolution; (2) parallel dependency (ARC-IIRAB) and constituency (ARC-MAHAL) parsers utilizing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based representations and tailored transition systems; and (3) a synthesis mechanism generating enriched hybrid syntactic representations. A primary contribution of this work is the creation and public release of the Quranic Treebank—the first complete, validated, and fully machine-readable hybrid syntactic resource for the CA, reconstructed and augmented using the Noor framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Noor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CA parsing, with the hybrid parser significantly outperforming previous benchmarks by over 4.6 F1 points on the Extended Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS). The framework is complemented by IIRAB Vis, a novel visualization tool designed to render complex hybrid structures in alignment with traditional Arabic grammatical principles (I'rāb). By providing both a validated SOTAmethodology and a foundational public dataset, this research substantially advances the computational analysis capabilities for CA across Natural Language Processing (NLP), digital humanities, and linguistic studies.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) presents a promising paradigm for decentralized machine learning, particularly well-suited for data-sensitive cyber-physical systems (CPS) where privacy preservation and low-latency inference are paramount. However, FL deployments at the edge face acute challenges in fault tolerance and communication efficiency due to the inherent unpredictability and heterogeneity of edge environments. This research addresses these issues through the development of a hierarchical federated learning framework that strategically combines clustered edge servers, the transfer-learning capabilities of pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 and TabNet models, and an enhanced aggregation approach based on FedProx to deliver superior robustness and efficiency. The proposed architecture introduces a multi-cluster aggregation mechanism, where edge servers within clusters coordinate local model updates before participating in higher-level aggregation, reducing inter-device communication overhead and overall latency. A distinctive contribution of this work is the explicit modeling and evaluation of system reliability by defining a “paralysis ratio” to quantify failed or unresponsive edge servers, and conducting real-time simulation experiments with incremental data delivery. Through this, the framework’s resilience is demonstrated, maintaining model accuracy above 93% even under up to 40% server paralysis. In comparative benchmarks against the established Multi-Cluster Hierarchical FL (MCHFL) baseline, the framework achieves a 4–6% increase in classification accuracy and a 25% reduction in average communication latency. Beyond quantitative improvements, the study analyzes hyperparameter trade-offs, notably the impact of the FedProx constraint (μ), and highlights the practical value of real-time transfer learning EfficientNet-B0 for images and TabNet for complex time-series accelerating convergence under non-IID conditions. Collectively, these innovations advance FL by delivering a fault-tolerant, latency-aware, and transferable aggregation strategy validated through real-time simulation, significantly broadening the applicability of FL in complex, real-world edge and CPS deployments.},

The RRA element features an octagonal reflective patch integrated with four phase delay lines, each controlled by PIN diodes. By adjusting the ON/OFF states of the diodes, 1-bit phase reconfigurability for linearly polarized (LP) waves and 2-bit phase control for circularly polarized (CP) waves are achieved. To validate the concept, a 16×16-element RRA prototype is fabricated and experimentally tested. An FPGA-based BCS is employed to enable dynamic electromagnetic functionality. Measurements confirm a ±60° beam-scanning capability. In the 1-bit LP-to-cross-LP mode, a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 10.6-12.8 GHz (~18.8%) is achieved, with a peak gain of 21.6 dBi and an aperture efficiency of 21.9%. For the 2-bit CP-to-co-CP mode, an AR < 3 dB bandwidth of 21.3% and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 18.4% are observed for both LHCP and RHCP. Peak gains of 23.8 dBic and 23.7 dBic are measured at 11.2 GHz, with aperture efficiencies of 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Point-interactive image colorization is a task that enables users to add color to grayscale images by providing sparse color annotations (hints) at user-defined locations. These hints are then propagated across the image to generate a plausible colorization result with minimal user effort. While existing methods have demonstrated effectiveness in leveraging user input, they often suffer from excessive color diffusion and color bleeding beyond object boundaries, compromising visual fidelity. In this work, we present an extended version of our previous method, iReWindColor, which introduced a window-based Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for efficient and fine-grained colorization. The extended framework incorporates two key improvements. First, we enhance the Window Encoder by integrating Window-Connecting Convolution module, which enables information exchange across adjacent windows. This addition mitigates discontinuities at window boundaries and improves spatial coherence in the colorized output. Second, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to quantitatively assess the impact of each architectural component and design choice, offering deeper insights into the effectiveness of the proposed modifications. Our approach employs small patches to achieve detailed color propagation while maintaining computational efficiency through localized attention. The Residual Embedding mechanism remains integral to aggregating global context, whereas the proposed Encode Block, which combines Self-Attention and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), strengthens inter-patch relationships and improves the utilization of user-provided hints. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the extended model consistently outperforms the original iReWindColor as well as other state-of-the-art methods, producing visually coherent, user-aligned colorizations with improved computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Learning to hash effectively addresses the challenges posed by massive data due to its low storage cost and fast search speed. Under multi-label scenarios, pair-wise hashing is typically determined by roughly counting the number of shared labels. However, this approach overlooks the intrinsic semantic information, leading to significant intra-class variations and ambiguity in neighborhood relationships. In this paper, by learning semantic class centers, the novel Deep Neighborhood-aware Hashing framework, termed DNaH, is designed to generate a highly discriminative Hamming space, thereby preserving binary codes with rich neighborhood information. Specifically, by building cross-block non-local information transmission, the simplified and effective hierarchical transformer encoder is introduced into the deep hash stream to capture distinguishing semantic descriptors, which achieves the distinctive representation capability of sophisticated networks while effectively promoting convergence efficiency. The binary representations from the Label Network are viewed as the semantic centers of categories, in which the class-guided loss is proposed to encourage the learned hashing codes to be close to the corresponding class centers. Moreover, by maximizing the semantic similarity between the relative position of binary-like representations and corresponding centroids, the position quantization strategy is developed to decrease projection errors and significantly enhance the distinguishability of the discrete codes. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets reveal that the DHaN framework delivers better performance in visual similarity search compared to several leading deep hashing approaches.

In addition, traditional methods have difficulty modelling the various factors associated with psoriasis symptoms. This research provides an enhanced method based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which includes data augmentation and transfer learning, to overcome the difficulties of limited data access and class imbalance in medical image classification. The dataset used comprises 1307 images categorized into two classes representing psoriatic and non-psoriatic images.

The model’s improved accuracy and reliability has the potential of early diagnosis of psoriasis and assisting dermatologists for making informed decisions. Furthermore, ViT’s ability to effectively capture lesion variation in different skin tones, textures and lighting conditions, highlighting its advantage over CNN-based approaches.

Each satellite was further evaluated by form factor and operational status to determine mission success rates. The results show that Earth observation accounts for 39% of all CubeSat missions, with the 3U form factor being the most commonly used and most successful in this domain. Educational missions are significantly underrepresented in launch frequency. Scientific missions, though more frequent, remain below Earth observation and communication in terms of mission volume.

However, conventional hydrogen production is associated with harmful emissions and relies heavily on depleting fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have been offered as alternative energy supplies to minimize fossil fuels and ensure lower emission levels, therefore, providing a sustainable energy transition. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT), are gaining wide attention for the production of green hydrogen. This article focuses on the storage of renewable energy generation to enhance the production process of green hydrogen. One of the main obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy is the need for inexpensive, highly efficient energy storage. Integrating renewable energy sources into green hydrogen production stands out as a promising solution to this problem. This work aims to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production by electrolysis from solar PV and wind energies. The implemented methodology is a theoretical model of a caustic electrolyzer connected to a solar PV panel and a wind generator. The study assessed the input/output power of solar and wind energy and calculated the green hydrogen production rate to underline the efficiency of the MPPT controller and renewable-based hydrogen production systems. According to the simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the hydrogen production system performs effectively, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Taking into account the final results, the Wind energy demonstrates superior performance in green hydrogen production, achieving 90% efficiency and a rate of 1.2 Nm³/h, significantly outperforming solar photovoltaics’ 82% efficiency and 0.66 Nm³/h.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of terrestrial sensor network applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for efficient ground coverage. This paper presents a two-step methodology for 2D ground coverage using UAV-enabled sensor networks, integrating antenna tilt modeling with angle-aware path optimization based on ant colony optimization (ACO). This combination enables more efficient control of the turning angle while maintaining competitive path lengths. In the first step, an optimal set of waypoints is generated for the movement of the UAV. This is achieved through aerial decomposition, incorporating the antenna footprint with and without tilting. The ground area is divided into UAV footprints, with each footprint’s center serving as a waypoint for the UAV’s movement. The decomposition is optimized using a metaheuristic approach to balance the inner and outer sensing coverage. The proposed method is evaluated using three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA). The second step focuses on path planning to visit all generated waypoints while minimizing travel distance and turning angles. The turning angle is measured in terms of the yaw angle, which defines the rotation of the UAV around its vertical axis. We employ an ACO-based coverage path planning algorithm to minimize both the path length and the turning angle. Performance is compared with two existing methods, showing an approximate improvement of 32.78% in the reduction of the turning angle.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, requires an early and accurate diagnosis. Deep learning models have advanced automated DR detection, but their reliance on high-dimensional features creates computational bottlenecks, limiting real-world deployment. This literature review (2019–2024) evaluates optimized Feature Selection (FS) techniques to address these challenges. We analyzed 70 studies focusing on FS methods integrated with deep learning models for DR classification. Our findings reveal that hybrid FS methods achieve higher accuracies, up to 98.9%, by combining filter-based dimensionality reduction with optimization-driven feature refinement. These methods reduce computational overhead by 40–60% compared to traditional techniques, enabling faster inference on resource-constrained devices. Classical techniques like LDA also show promising results but risk omitting non-linear biomarkers. Despite progress, challenges persist—class imbalance in public datasets skews models toward majority classes, while aggressive FS risks discarding critical features like microaneurysms. This survey provides a detailed analysis of FS techniques that reduce inference time and discusses accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, inference latency reporting, and future directions for real-time clinical deployment in the domain.},

  abstract     = {As urban mobility trends shift toward greater customization and flexibility, selecting between Fixed-Route Transit (FRT) and Demand-Responsive connector (DRC) systems remains a key challenge, particularly in low-density areas. This study develops a dual-perspective service quality model that integrates passenger utility and operator cost to determine the Critical Demand Density (CDD)—the threshold at which switching between FRT and DRT becomes optimal. The model captures core components of travel time (walking, waiting, riding) and operational characteristics. Under non-subsidized conditions, FRT is more suitable in compact, high-demand regions, while DRT better serves decentralized, low-demand areas, with the CDD threshold at approximately 13 passengers/hour/km². Incorporating fiscal subsidies, the model reformulates utility functions to include passenger-based marginal subsidies. Results show that subsidies significantly shift the mode transition threshold, increasing the CDD to 22 passengers/hour/km² and improving DRC’s competitiveness. Sensitivity analyses reveal that factors such as service area geometry, walking time importance, and subsidy magnitude markedly affect CDD values. The model provides a practical, policy-relevant tool for optimizing transit mode decisions based on spatial demand and financial support. This work highlights the strategic role of subsidies in enhancing DRT viability and contributes to sustainable and inclusive urban mobility planning.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

In a field deployment across 12 small-to-medium commercial offices (SMOs) in Fukuoka, Japan (September–November 2024; N=57), the platform was evaluated using a dual-track design. Statistical analysis of hour-level observations across valid workdays (baseline: n = 511; intervention: n = 421) demonstrated substantial energy reduction with large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.72, t(930) = 10.94, p < 0.001), representing a 23.3% decrease in non-HVAC consumption. Targeted evening analysis confirmed intervention effectiveness, with lighting consumption declining 21.4% during notification periods (t = 2.98, p < 0.01, d = 0.51). The action-window analysis isolated user-behavior effects from automated prompts; peak savings of 70.9 Wh were observed within 15 minutes following air-conditioning alerts. The awareness–behavior correlation increased from r = 0.336 (n.s.) to r = 0.634 (p = 0.020), Δr = +0.298. In addition, 69.2% of participants shifted toward more conservation-oriented profiles in a four-quadrant behavioral classification.

  abstract     = {Transformer models are significantly advancing the field of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in tasks such as the extraction of concepts and relationships from texts. However, while various studies employ single transformer models for one or both tasks and achieve performance improvements, there remain some limitations. A single model may struggle to optimize for both tasks simultaneously, resulting in poor performance in one or both areas. Furthermore, a single model may experience increased computational and memory demands when used for both tasks, as it must process and retain both entity-level and relation-level features. This can lead to inefficiencies and poor performance, especially on large or complex datasets. Moreover, when a single transformer model handles both tasks, errors in concept extraction can directly affect relation extraction, as the latter relies on accurate identification of entities. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel Multimodal Transformer-based Fusion (MTF) model that integrates token-level representations and entity representations from different transformer models for enhanced relation classification. The proposed MTF model employs a fused cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these heterogeneous representations within the transformer encoder, leveraging complementary linguistic and entity-specific information. Through a structured tokenization process, we generate unified token and entity embeddings, enabling the model to learn a more distinctive representation space for improved relational understanding. The proposed MTF model is evaluated on five transformer-based architectures using the Conll04 and NYT benchmark datasets. The transformer-based architectures include three models for concept extration, namely, BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa, and two models for relation extraction, namely, LUKE and mLUKE. The comparison of individual model results reveal RoBERTa and mLuke as the best performing models for concept extraction and relation extraction, respectively. On both tasks, fusing the best two performing models results in the proposed MTF model outperforming the best individual models in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the results with related studies, shows the superior performance of the proposed MTF model with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 96.86%, 96.89%, 96.86%, 96.87%, respectively.},

To address these challenges, recent studies have integrated cognitive thinking into jamming decision-making, enabling the development of cognitive jamming systems. While prior research has explored jamming decision-making at various stages, a comprehensive, phase-based framework remains underdeveloped. This study bridges this gap by formalizing the mathematical logic of radar jamming and introducing a systematic decision-making framework encompassing four critical dimensions: (1) jamming resource allocation, (2) jamming pattern selection, (3) jamming waveform optimization, and (4) jamming timing determination. Leveraging the proposed framework, we conduct a detailed review and comparative analysis of the existing literature, categorizing approaches into traditional and cognitive jamming decision-making paradigms. We provide a focused review of reinforcement learning-based cognitive jamming decision-making with a systematic analysis of four critical aspects: problem modeling, radar state representation, reward function setting, and algorithmic implementation. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and provide forward-looking insights into the future evolution of radar jamming decision-making.},

In this paper, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed for more efficient verification of the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of some sampled pentagons are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect matches of keypoint can then be identified easily with homography estimated from these pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate estimation of homography can be obtained efficiently and more accurately for planar scenes of the HPatches dataset, based on keypoint matching results provided by LoFTR [21]. Besides, a new way of showing inliers (and outlier) for the above matching results and possible extension of the approach for multi-plane situation are also demonstrated.},

The present study analyses in detail how data collected with FocalVid are related to human gaze data.

Such a comparison is critical to justifying the use of FocalVid or similar platforms, and for choosing suitable user interface settings to produce results most similar to human gaze. Cursor movements in FocalVid are shown to have notable similarities with eye movements. For example, distributions of cursor velocities and fixation durations are qualitatively similar to those of eye movements.

While formal verification techniques, such as Timed Automata (TA) models analyzed with UPPAAL, provide strong offline assurances, transitioning these models into reliable executable systems remains a major challenge, especially when integrated with unverified legacy systems. This paper shows that combining formal verification with runtime monitoring can effectively bridge this gap and enhance system reliability. We introduce a novel framework that automatically translates UPPAAL-verified TA models into executable Go programs, leveraging a new intermediate formalism, Timed Automata with Disjoint Actions (TADA), to make time progression explicit and resolve semantic ambiguities in code generation. By integrating lightweight runtime monitors into the generated code, our approach ensures continuous enforcement of timing invariants even when verified components interact with legacy elements. Compared to prior work focused solely on offline verification, our hybrid approach offers a robust safety envelope in heterogeneous environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study on an industrial control system, showing that it successfully detects and mitigates timing violations introduced by legacy components, significantly improving overall system resilience.},

With the rise of multilingual applications, ensuring secure interaction between different programming languages has become a critical aspect of software security. However, prior analysis approaches for Android applications have primarily focused on Java, Python, and C, leaving the risks in C#-based multilingual applications largely unaddressed. We propose a static taint analysis approach tailored for C#-based multilingual applications, along with an implementation for the Xamarin platform, named Xades, to detect sensitive data leaks. Xades offers an overview of how C# code interfaces with other programming languages by constructing a comprehensive call graph that captures cross-language method invocations. To ensure accuracy, Xades analyzes C# code in detail, addressing accessor methods and method chaining to produce a precise call graph. It, then, performs context-, flow-, field-, object- sensitive taint analysis with the call graph. Following the analysis of the C# codebase, Xades produces a taint analysis summary and translates it into Jimple IR, to analyze Xamarin.Android applications through a modified FlowDroid. We evaluated Xades on our benchmarks and real-world apps. As a result, Xades successfully detected all data leaks with interactions between C# and Java in benchmarks. It, also, detected 395 out of 6,087 real-world Android applications leak sensitive data.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for ultra-reliable, high-capacity wireless networks necessitates efficient channel state estimation (CSE) in 6G-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Conventional estimators like least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) suffer from significant performance degradation under limited pilot symbols, creating a critical bottleneck for spectral efficiency. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep neural network (HyDNN) architecture that synergizes a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) to jointly exploit spatial-temporal channel correlations. The model is trained offline on multipath fading channel data and deployed online as a pilot-assisted estimator, requiring no prior channel knowledge. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that HyDNN reduces the symbol error rate (SER) by 34% (at 15 dB SNR) compared to MMSE with only 2 pilots, while achieving near-optimal performance with 64 pilots. The Adam-optimized HyDNN (CNN-GRU variant) outperforms standalone CNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, showing robustness to reduced cyclic prefix lengths (e.g., CP=12). Notably, with 2 pilots, HyDNN achieves an SER of 0.228 (vs. 0.465 for LS at 10 dB SNR), reducing pilot overhead by 75% without sacrificing accuracy. These advancements position HyDNN as a scalable, resource-efficient solution for next-generation NOMA systems, aligning with 6G goals of low-latency and high spectral efficiency.},

To promote human-machine collaboration and to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) in Industry 5.0, advanced sixth generation (6G) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology play an important role. They offer capabilities of enhanced coverage, improved connectivity, remote monitoring, efficient data collection and advanced automation. This paper presents a 6G powered framework for UAV network assisted with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). The IRS-aided UAV communication exploits the IRS beamforming capabilities with UAV mobility. An optimal phase control strategy of IRS is presented considering the total power consumption at the IRS and UAV. Further, an association scheme is proposed that smartly assigns users to the specific IRSs for maximum line-of-sight (LoS) channel power gain with optimal phase control. The impact of transmit power pmax, number of time slots and number of IRS elements N on the average sum rate is evaluated under the proposed association and phase control. It is observed that the proposed association scheme promises an average sum rate of 12.8 bps/Hz with N=500. Also, the sum rate further improves by 6.49% with optimal phase control. colorblackIn the end, the system incorporating random association scheme is compared with conventional system with no association introduced.},

By accurately predicting the output of the feedback controller at the next moment and using the predicted results as feedforward compensation inputs, the overall performance of the control system is significantly improved. First, a Parallel GRU-Transformer neural network was constructed to compensate for the limitations of LSTM and GRU neural networks in parallel processing due to their recursive structure, enabling the network to accurately predict the control output at the next moment. Then, a control strategy integrating Parallel GRU-Transformer feedforward compensation was designed, and the predicted results were introduced into the feedforward compensation control strategy to compensate for the output of the feedback controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing its prediction accuracy with the State-of-the-Art neural network model and the original control strategy. The experimental results show that the neural network based on Parallel GRU-Transformer has excellent prediction ability. Introducing its prediction results into the feedforward compensation control strategy significantly reduces tracking error and its Moving Average (MA) and Moving Standard Deviation (MSD), improving tracking performance.

Aiming at the problem of inaccurate results of VMETRIC model under low availability, an inventory optimization model of repairable parts of any level and any tier based on the process of generation and destruction is established. By predicting the demand rate and arrival rate of each level of station and each type of spare parts, it builds a model of the birth and death process of each part, and proposes a method of calculating the equipment availability based on the birth and death process. Taking the equipment availability of the whole security system as the constraint index and the lowest total purchase cost of spare parts as the goal, the optimal spare parts allocation plan is obtained by using the marginal algorithm, and a simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimized plan. The simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimization scheme. Combined with the example, the simulation results are used as the test standard, and the authoritative VMETRIC software is selected to compare and illustrate with the analytical model in terms of optimization performance, calculation accuracy and applicability. The results show that both the analytical model and the VMETRIC software have a certain scope of application, and the combination of analytical model and simulation is undoubtedly more adaptable.},

Existing edge shape-based template matching algorithms have prolonged matching time, severely impacting efficiency. To address real-time positioning of coordinates and angles during flying die piercing, this paper proposes an algorithm based on edge feature reconstruction, ensuring robustness, accuracy and real-time performance to enhance transfer efficiency. Firstly, in template creation, a sparse edge point strategy balances accuracy and time. Relative gradient amplitude filters non-critical edge points to reduce computation, while keeping template reference points unchanged to ensure stability. Secondly, in image matching, the minimum region two-step search limits the target area, reducing matching points. The minimum similarity threshold restricts offset angle search, excluding incorrect templates in real time. Experiments used 40 single-chip images to verify optimization effectiveness, compare angle recognition effects, and evaluate performance against other algorithms. The results show that compared with NCC, SSDA and LGSC algorithms, the proposed real-time positioning algorithm can significantly improve the positioning efficiency(Avg time 3.85 ms) while ensuring the positioning accuracy(Avg precision 96.33%), and meet the robustness, accuracy and time requirements of the machine vision system for the positioning chip during the massive transfer process of Mini LED.},

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based diagnostic framework integrating hybrid feature extraction with advanced classification models. The framework is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive real-world dataset of 3,000 labeled samples, each characterized by 80 features. A dual-stage feature extraction methodology is employed, utilizing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multiresolution time–frequency analysis and Matching Pursuit (MP) for adaptive sparse decomposition, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to mitigate redundancy and enhance class separability. Four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures are comparatively evaluated: a Deep Ensemble of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), a Time Series Transformer, a CNN–LSTM hybrid, and a Conv1D–BiLSTM network. Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble MLP architecture achieves superior diagnostic performance, attaining peak accuracy of 99.50% coupled with a minimal false alarm rate of 0.33%, and consistently outperforms the comparative models across a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics. These findings substantiate that ensemble methods and attention-based transformer models offer significant advantages over traditional recurrent-convolutional hybrid architectures for this task. The proposed framework demonstrates substantial potential for enabling robust, high-precision fault classification in real-time transformer condition monitoring systems.},

Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes.

However, discrete sensors such as accelerometers and strain gauges face limitations in observing vibration distributions in multicopters due to restricted attachment points and their potential impact on flight performance. To address these challenges, we propose a model-tracking-based 3D vibration measurement method for flying multicopters using ground-installed stereo high-frame-rate (HFR) cameras, avoiding the need for onboard sensor installation. Our method utilizes digital image correlation (DIC) on stereo HFR images to achieve precise 3D vibration displacement measurements in the audio frequency range, leveraging thousands of tracked measurement points on a 3D multicopter model for whole-body vibration analysis. To validate our model-tracking method, we analyze stereo 1920×1080 images at 500 fps in the frequency domain, capturing a hovering multicopter with four rotors rotating at hundreds of rps. Along with estimating its 6-DoF trajectory and rotor rotation speeds as operational status indicators, the 3D vibration distribution at 3518 tracked points was visualized by referencing a pre-measured 3D model of the multicopter, including 3D frequency component images at peak frequencies ranging from 0 to 250 Hz, which correspond to structural properties, control errors, and rotor-induced forced vibrations.},

  abstract     = {Laterally Constrained Inversion (LCI) is presently a popular method for robust interpretation of geophysical data, particularly in defining subsurface structures with greater lateral continuity. The traditional standalone 1D inversion methods, while computationally efficient, often produce unrealistic discontinuities between adjacent soundings in the retrieved models. LCI overcomes this limitation by enforcing lateral constraints that enforce smooth variation across adjacent models, producing quasi-2D results that are more realistic in some geological settings. This paper presents a systematic review of the recent advancement in LCI and its methodological extensions like Weighted LCI (WLCI), Iterative LCI (ILCI), Minimum Gradient Support LCI (MGS-LCI), and Bayesian LCI. All these techniques offer more flexibility while handling heterogeneous subsurface conditions, hard contacts, and uncertainty estimation. A full methodology is given, with emphasis on mathematical formulae and regularization strategies for controlling lateral as well as vertical smoothing. Incorporation of a priori geological knowledge and constraint design, resolution versus smoothness trade-offs, and computational considerations are also covered. A case study from the Horn River Basin, Canada, demonstrates the application of LCI approaches to airborne TEM data and indicates improved model continuity, geological coherence, and interpretability. This review points out that while LCI methods have significantly enhanced the potential of geophysical inversion, future research has to be focused on hybrid methods, automatic tuning of constraints, large-scale algorithms, and multi-modal data fusion. These developments will be crucial to dealing with increasingly larger and more complex datasets and delivering more accurate and reliable subsurface models for a variety of geoscientific and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Image enhancement is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to improve the quality of images and enhance visual elements, making them more informative and aesthetically pleasing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool in the field, showing promise in enhancing and restoring image quality. Despite their potential, GAN-based methods often face challenges such as instability, high computational costs, and the risk of generating unwanted visual artifacts that degrade the final image quality. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel architecture called ViTRA, which combines the capabilities of the Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Relative Positional Encoding (RPE)-based attention mechanism. The ViTRA architecture is integrated into the HVI-CIDNet framework, specifically within the Light Cross-Attention Block (LCAB). By incorporating RPE, the architecture is enhanced, leading to the creation of a new attention mechanism known as the Relative Light Cross-Attention Block (RLCAB). This innovation allows for more effective feature extraction and attention distribution across the image, resulting in better image enhancement and fewer artifacts. Additionally, ViTRA implements automatic loss function weight optimization using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO) which is designed to improve stability and efficiency during model training. Experimental results demonstrate that the ViTRA architecture significantly improves image quality in both qualitative and quantitative terms when compared to traditional GAN and transformer-based approaches. On various benchmark datasets, including the LOLv2-Syn dataset, ViTRA outperforms existing models across all test metrics. Specifically, it achieves a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 25.716, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.946, and a Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.0446, highlighting its superior performance in producing high-quality images. This work establishes ViTRA as a promising solution for enhancing image quality, overcoming common limitations in GAN and transformer-based models, and providing a robust approach for future image enhancement applications.},

This study explores how graph-based techniques can address the challenges of data availability and label quality. An approach is formalized that leverages graph theory to enhance entity-resolution performance by augmenting datasets and identifying mislabeled data points. To evaluate three methods of the graph-based approach, that is data augmentation, consistency check, and loss-outlier detection, a framework to generate entity resolution datasets with varying properties such as label noise, class distribution, or amount of entities is developed. The methods are then evaluated using this framework and ten different real-world datasets. The main findings are as follows: On average, the amount of usable data can be increased by a factor of 2.5 without introducing additional label noise. Among the methods aimed at identifying label noise, the consistency check is able to detect approximately 16% of incorrectly labeled data points. The loss-based outlier detection method removes about 26% of the false labels, although this entails discarding 10% of the overall data points. Further analyses are conducted to investigate the factors influencing these methods and to better understand their mechanisms of action. The contributions of this study include: (1) formalizing previous preliminary work on graph-based augmentation, (2) developing a framework for entity-resolution dataset generation, and (3) providing in-depth evaluation of the performance and influencing factors of graph-based augmentation and label-noise identification.},

  abstract     = {This research studies transmit pre-processing designs using two millimeter wave (mmWave) active arrays with a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) software-defined radio (SDR) platform under an over-the-air (OTA) communication emulator. It covers the fast Doppler, line-of-sight (LOS) with small delay effect, and MIMO array interference effects. In this emulator, we propose spatial nulling and MIMO pre-processing cancellation techniques to eliminate the MIMO streams interference. First, differential training sequences are utilized to acquire and compensate for the LOS fast Doppler offset. Next, a maximum power beam scanning scheme via the phase shifters of mmWave arrays is employed to estimate the arrival angles between MIMO array transmitter and receiver stations. Subsequently, the steering vectors of the desired and interference signals via these estimated angles are adopted by the phase-only optimization algorithms to calculate the spatial beamforming weights of the two mmWave arrays, which can null the interference stream and retain the desired stream. Because we observed that the residual MIMO interference lingers in the MIMO receiver even after the spatial nulling processing with the interference mitigation, we further propose a MIMO pre-processing filters using the least square method to cancel the residual MIMO interference. Finally, the measurement results of the two mmWave arrays SDR platform with the fast Doppler and the OTA scenarios confirm that the proposed joint spatial nulling and MIMO pre-cancellation techniques can eliminate the MIMO interference and provide the high-quality error vector magnitude (EVM) performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in adversarial machine learning have shown that defenses previously considered robust are actually susceptible to adversarial attacks which are specifically customized to target their weaknesses. However, whether the adversarial examples generated by customized attacks, are effective on other defenses, is an open question. In this work we seek to explore three important security questions: First, do different defense strategies exhibit the same low transferability properties as different model architectures and, if so, how can this low transferability be utilized to improve robustness? Second, how can a white-box adversary design attacks to specifically thwart multi-defense based setups? Last, how can game theoretic analysis further improve the robustness against an adversary capable of implementing multiple state-of-the-art attacks? To this end we provide multiple contributions, including the first transferability study between multiple defense strategies, three new attack algorithms designed to break random transform and ensemble defenses, and two game theoretic frameworks for analyzing and optimizing robustness over a combination of adversarial attacks and defenses. Empirically, we show our framework is 18% more robust on CIFAR-10 and is 27% more robust on Tiny-ImageNet than the best single state-of-the-art defense that we analzye.},

  abstract     = {The increasing adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems has intensified the challenges in managing output fluctuations. Although corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs) offer long-term renewable energy procurement, research on integrated on/off-site energy management, business continuity planning (BCP)-compliant frameworks, and optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) operations within CPPA models remains limited. This study proposes a CPPA business model for three customer types, each equipped with on-site PV systems, a BESS, and access to an off-site solar power plant with additional BESS. An algorithm is developed to generate optimal day-ahead planned power flows (PPFs) while considering BCP requirements and managing real-time BESS operations. The model comprises: (i) on-site CPPA for direct power supply and (ii) off-site CPPA, enabling remote energy supply from a solar power plant and facilitating power sharing among customers. The algorithm employs multi-objective optimization to minimize grid dependence, maximize surplus electricity sales, and balance PV utilization with revenue maximization through a weighting coefficient. A lower coefficient increases PV utilization, whereas a higher value increases revenue. Simulation results demonstrate that optimal BESS operations effectively reduce PV generation prediction errors, reduce reverse power flow, fulfill PPF requirements, and ensure BCP compliance with approximately 97.5% backup power reliability, irrespective of weighting coefficient. The optimal coordination of on-site and off-site CPPAs enhances local consumption of PV-generated electricity while aligning power transactions with market prices to maximize revenue. These findings provide insight into the developing advanced business models and algorithms for CPPA projects and PV plant operators, particularly in post-feed-in tariff (FIT) agreements.},

This study (n = 64) investigates the effects of negative attitudes and varying degrees of distraction on human interaction with a delivery robot in a virtual reality (VR) setting. Participants were divided into two groups exposed to video descriptions aimed at influencing their attitudes toward robots positively or negatively, or to a baseline group without an intervention. The experiment followed a 3x4 mixed-design methodology with three groups (positive, negative, and baseline) and four distraction conditions: none, cognitive, visual, and combined. Participants’ acceptable distances, subjective discomfort, and perceived safety were measured. The results did not show significant differences in attitudes, distances, or discomfort between the three description groups, suggesting that the videos did not effectively alter attitudes. However, the baseline group reported significantly lower feelings of safety. Participants with high negative attitudes before the experiment showed a significant reduction in negativity regardless of group assignment, indicating that these individuals’ attitude benefited from the exposure. These individuals also maintained significantly greater distances and evaluated the interaction with the robot as less safe. Further analysis revealed a negative correlation between perceived robot weight and safety, with both video groups estimating the robot’s weight higher than the baseline group. Simultaneous distractions caused the highest discomfort, while no distraction resulted in the lowest. These findings highlight the importance of considering distraction, potential attitudes, and perceived threat when designing robot behavior for safe and satisfactory interactions.},

More detailed scientific research and practical tools are needed to identify and analyze ES interdependencies in this area. The research gap mainly concerns the need for more transparent procedures to enable ES operators to understand the interdependencies between operators, hamper effective risk management. The article aims to develop a method for identifying and eliminating ES interdependencies. The method is intended to detect ES interdependencies that threaten the continuity of operation of more than one ES. The author applies Gorbatov’s Principle of Characterization, which makes it possible to create graph models of interdependence and identify so-called forbidden figures or undesirable patterns of interdependence. By analyzing such patterns, it is possible to identify places where there are potential risks and propose structural changes that will eliminate them. In the context of the available research work on considering ES interdependencies and their impact on business continuity risk, the author’s proposed method fills the research gap on the analysis of the static structure of ES interdependencies, in terms of looking for structural defects.},

  abstract     = {In conventional educational environments, it is labor-intensive, subjective, and susceptible to human error to hand-mark descriptive answers. This article introduces AIvaluate, a modular, rubric-guided multi-agent system for theory-based student answer script marking automation. The system combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Azure Document Intelligence with a Cleaning Agent powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Azure AI Foundry that cleans the text obtained without losing semantic information and ensures anonymization. Answers are parsed using RegEx to de-sentence question identifiers and mapped into corresponding correct answers and faculty-defined marking schemes in a MongoDB database. The system supports structured input prompts, where rubrics are dynamically injected into the evaluation context for consistency and flexibility across subjects. An Evaluation Agent, also driven by the LLM, matches the sanitized student answer to the correct answer and provides both a score and one-line feedback. To supplement this generative scoring, a semantic similarity-based scoring is employed via FAISS and the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 transformer model; however, this vector-based pipeline is used purely for research benchmarking and does not contribute to the final marks. Experimental outcomes indicate strong correlation between AI-computed scores and human faculty ratings, particularly in the LLM-based pipeline. This system is designed particularly for technical and theory-based academic tests, and not for literary or creative questions where language usage is the prevailing criterion. The suggested approach reduces evaluation time by approximately 70–80% compared to manual correction, without compromising fairness and transparency.},

Distribution networks connect domestic and light commercial loads to the wider grid, and operating outside of their design criteria will compromise reliability and may result in outright loss of supply. Owing to the extensive scale of distribution network assets in the form of transformers and underground cable networks, estimates of the remaining available headroom and its erosion through connection of new low carbon technology is unclear. The approach contributed in this paper enables appropriate scaling of electrical heat load, sensitive to local gas-equivalent use, facilitating the assessment of distribution network threats in the absence of monitoring data. Geospatially linked historical fiscal demand data is used as a proxy for detailed physical and behavioral model inputs and impacts are demonstrated experimentally via power flow calculations carried out on models of actual distribution feeders. Measurement of impact was assessed via voltage and thermal violations against statutory limits. This contribution can support distribution network operators in forestalling the localized impacts of various electric heat pump penetration scenarios, reducing potential of overloads, as well as informing optimal reinforcement investment decisions.},

We propose MedFD, a FL framework tailored for cross-institutional MIC under realistic constraints. MedFD enables each client to train a personalized model by incorporating both global and historical local knowledge in a unified distillation process, improving adaptation to heterogeneous data without accessing raw samples. To enhance communication efficiency, MedFD compresses model updates via low-rank decomposition guided by adaptive energy-retention constraints, substantially reducing transmitted parameter volume. We provide theoretical analysis on convergence and generalization under non-IID settings. Experiments on four public 2D and 3D medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that MedFD consistently outperforms strong FL baselines in both accuracy and communication efficiency, making it well-suited for scalable and privacy-preserving clinical deployment.},

In this paper, we propose a plaintext recovery attack against their scheme under an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack model. We further identify critical flaws in both the scheme’s design and its accompanying security proof. To address these issues, we propose a revised construction that mitigates the identified vulnerabilities and restores the intended security guarantees. Our modification incurs only minimal overhead; hence, the computational and communication efficiency of the modified scheme remains almost equivalent to that of the original design.},

However, this data-driven interconnectivity exposes manufacturing to sophisticated cyber-attacks, one of the well-known attack is a backdoor that silently impairs AI systems. Traditional defence mechanisms are often rigid and not tailored to the unique requirements of Industry 4.0. To address this, we introduce CyberGuard, a novel Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework designed specifically for detecting backdoor attacks in smart manufacturing environments. Unlike methods focusing on direct attack recognition, proposed CyberGuard models normal system behavior and identifies deviations as potential threats. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer AutoEncoder (TAE) to detect anomalies within feature maps. Further, extensive testing on multiple datasets confirms CyberGuard’s capability to detect subtle yet crucial irregularities. We have conducted a comprehensive experiment against multiple backdoor attacks and compared and evaluated CyberGuard with Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Active Clustering, and Spectral Signature. In addition, an additional experiment is also conducted by employing a T-test statistical analysis to demonstrate the significant differentiation between normal and compromised feature maps, thereby validating CyberGuard effectiveness without prior distribution knowledge of the attacks. The results demonstrate that CyberGuard significantly outperformed traditional defences by achieving approximate 100% detection with high F1-score compared to existing defences.},

  abstract     = {Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a crucial technique for maintaining model accuracy at extremely low-bit precision (i.e., 4-bit or lower). However, the fake quantization operation of QAT introduces significant training time overhead compared to post-training quantization (PTQ). To address this challenge, we propose SQUAD, a scalable hardware accelerator designed to perform fake quantization operations in any precision at high-performance and energy efficiency. Our proposed SQUAD consists of multiple parallel and pipelined quantization accelerator cores (Agents), with peripherals such as buffer, control units, etc. According to our analysis on QAT of ResNet, MobileNetV2, and DeiT, SQUAD reduces the fake quantization latency by 93.1% and energy consumption by 97.6%, compared to a commercial edge GPU. When SQUAD is applied to QAT on an edge GPU, it significantly accelerates the forward pass, resulting in 48.8% lower latency and 51.2% lower energy consumption. Consequently, these improvements contribute to an overall training latency reduction and energy reduction of 14.6% and 15.3%, with only 0.43% area overhead.},

  abstract     = {The accurate diagnosis of skin diseases, particularly in distinguishing between visually similar conditions such as Measles, Monkeypox, Chickenpox, and Normal skin states, remains a critical challenge in clinical dermatology. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.},

However, with the upcoming advent of quantum computing, conventional security methods are encountering new and significant challenges, requiring the revaluation of pre and post-quantum security measures. This study provides an in-depth analysis of security measures before and after the advent of quantum computing for intelligent IoT applications enabled by 5G-connected network. The survey thoroughly analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of conventional public key cryptography methods such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Secret Sharing, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which are susceptible to quantum risks, and postquantum cryptographic methods such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate based techniques, which may provide protection against quantum attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the suitability of these strategies in the context of 5G-enabled IoT deployments, taking into account the distinct requirements and obstacles presented by interconnected IoT devices. Although pre quantum public key cryptographic algorithms are still in use, but active research is going on to design and implement PQC algorithms to secure 5G IoT, while hybrid schemes have shown great promise being backward compatible with traditional cryptographic approaches at the same time bring quantum resistance. The survey offers significant insights into the latest pre and post-quantum security solutions for 5G-enabled IoT Applications.

  abstract     = {As the practical implementation of autonomous driving technology accelerates, the ability to accurately recognize surrounding objects during driving and to stably track their movements have become essential. In particular, 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) is a core technology for safe path planning and collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles, because it is important to not only identify the current positions of objects but to accurately understand their trajectories. Recently, camera-based 3D MOT has been studied as a cost-effective alternative to expensive LiDAR sensors. However, this approach tends to rely heavily on deep learning detection models, resulting in a significant degradation of tracking continuity in environments with limited computational resources, or in situations where detection fails. To solve that degradation problem, this study proposes a geometry-based motion optimization method that can predict object movement to enable continuous tracking without deep learning inferences. The proposed system operates by optimizing object acceleration and yaw angle in the prediction stage of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on the 3D bounding box and the constant turn rate and acceleration (CTRA) model, which reflect the physical characteristics of vehicles. In particular, by introducing a line sampling technique that utilizes segments inside the bounding box and corresponding points in the image—based on an extended form of epipolar geometry—the geometric validity of motion prediction is secured. The optimization process is based on quadratic programming, ensuring both numerical stability and computational efficiency, and the generated pseudo-detection can be used as a substitute observation, even in time intervals where actual detection does not occur. Experiments using the nuScenes dataset evaluated the performance of the proposed method under various detection interval conditions. As a result, while fast, poly-based tracking systems show increased tracking fragmentation and error as the detection interval grows longer, the proposed method demonstrates more stable tracking performance in terms of six metrics. In particular, we quantitatively and qualitatively confirm that the proposed method predicts object motion in near real time, even in frames where deep learning detection is absent. This study presents a practical alternative that ensures both real-time performance and reliability from camera-based 3D MOT, and demonstrates its applicability in real-time autonomous driving systems where using high-performance GPUs or continuous deep learning inference is not feasible. Furthermore, it proves that high-performance tracking can be achieved without relying heavily on appearance features, but by using only geometric constraints and a physics-based prediction model. Future research plans will expand the proposed framework into a more generalized 3D MOT system by applying various motion models tailored to different object motion characteristics beyond the currently used CTRA model.},

This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 96 peer-reviewed studies, following the PRISMA guidelines. Based on this foundation, large language model use cases across industries were identified, categorized, and structured using the primary and secondary activities of Porter’s value chain as a classification framework. The analysis reveals that LLM adoption is heavily concentrated in technology-focused and internal operational activities across industries, where they offer immediate benefits at lower risk. In contrast, areas such as logistics, procurement, and customer-facing functions remain largely unexplored, mainly due to challenges related to integration, data governance, and regulatory requirements. The analysis shows that current deployments are primarily limited to isolated, manageable use cases, leaving substantial innovation potential unrealized in underexplored value chain activities. These findings provide a foundation for further research and for the strategic adoption of large language models throughout the industrial value chain.},

  abstract     = {Lightning strikes have posed a severe threat to the operational safety of wind turbines. As an additional lightning-protection measure, metal meshes have been deployed on a number of turbines. However, under high-amplitude lightning currents, the mesh undergoes erosion, potentially compromising its lightning-protection effectiveness. Currently, blade-mounted meshes directly follow aerospace mesh standards, and the relationship between structural parameters and erosion mass on curved blade geometries is seldom reported. Therefore, This paper develops a parametric grid structure-based lighting strike simulation model for wind turbine blade metal mesh. The model analyzes the influence weights of mesh thickness, wire width, and grid size on the ablation mass of the metal mesh. The validity of the simulation model was verified through A+C combined lightning current ablation tests. A multivariate nonlinear regression equation for the ablation mass of the metal mesh was established, providing a quantitative method to evaluate the lightning protection capability of metal meshes with different structural parameters. The results show that under a density of 800 g/m³, the test group’s metal mesh had an ablation mass of 800 mg after exposure to the combined waveform, while the calculated ablation mass using the regression equation was 748 mg, yielding an error of 6.5%. The proposed equation provides a method to quantify the lightning protection capability of metal meshes with varying grid structural parameters.},

  abstract     = {Operational delays and air traffic complexity have increased with the growing global demand for air traffic, leading to irregular and less predictable traffic patterns. Although existing air traffic models have effectively addressed these challenges, they often trade off scalability, realism, and generalizability, particularly in en-route airspace, where both horizontal and vertical maneuvers matter. This paper proposes a two-dimensional cellular automaton model for simulating aircraft behavior in both the route direction and flight level. The model integrates realistic phase-specific aircraft dynamics and selectively applies separation controls (e.g., vectoring, holding, and speed control) only when operationally relevant. The proposed model is part of the Aerospace Bricks framework, which uses minimum simulation units (‘‘bricks’’) to represent specific airport and airspace features. Two case studies were conducted. The first used 10-day arrival traffic data from eight major Japanese airports to validate the model’s fidelity. The model successfully reproduced typical vector patterns and agreed closely with actual flight distances with spacing delays, averaging 95.3 s per flight within 80 NM of Tokyo International Airport. The second study simulated a full day of traffic in the Fukuoka Flight Information Region and identified high-complexity upper sectors at FL335 and above. The analysis detected several hotspots, such as flights with spacing adjustments and flights with traffic conflicts. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently reproduce realistic traffic dynamics and quantify delay and conflict risks. The proposed framework enables users to configure simulation environments that are easily tailored to specific operational scenarios.},

The HA-RCAE is augmented with regularization techniques and a novel hybrid attention mechanism for enhanced feature extraction.

The proposed method exhibits excellent generalizability, characterized by minimal performance discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, its applicability extends to EEG anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across clinical tasks.

The proposal focuses on frequency support during contingencies, especially in terms of Synthetic Inertia (SI), for the Wind Power Plant (WPP), and Fast Frequency Response (FFR), for the BESS, allowing for a consistent decarbonization strategy throughout the operation. In particular, the BESS is analytically designed to provide the desired FFR for a contingency situation, allowing the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) of the system to be mitigated according to a design criterion that only requires the grid inertia and rated parameters, without relying on complex formulations or optimization methods. It is observed that the established design criterion is conservative and the enhancement in RoCoF values is above the expected. Furthermore, the synthetic inertia of the wind power plant can have an individual limited impact on the system’s RoCoF due to design and power ramping time, while the fast frequency response of the BESS has an additional impact due to the lack of power ramping requirements. Real-time simulation results validate the proposed methodology for an offshore industrial application within the Oil & Gas (O&G) industry.},

  abstract     = {With the growing demand for high-mobility next-generation wireless environment, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) has emerged as the best transformative modulation technique due to its unique potential to provide reliable next-generation communication amid high mobility and doubly dispersive channel conditions like vehicular communication and aerial communication networks. The reliability and robustness of the OTFS system rely heavily on the equalization techniques employed. To ensure robustness and to improve reliability, this work proposes a novel equalization technique called Hierarchically Guided Residual Aware Equalization (HGRAE). This framework of doubly iterative Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization encompasses the Transpose-free Quasi Minimal Residual (TFQMR) solver along with an Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner. HGRAE uses a two-stage iterative approach, in which the Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) MMSE equalizer exchanges extrinsic information with the SISO decoder through multiple turbo iterations. These two iterations, namely TFQMR and AMG, are used to suppress the residual errors, respectively. TFQMR is used as the outer solver, which iteratively refines the solution to the linear equation without the need for matrix transposition while ensuring the algorithm’s numerical stability. AMG is a multilevel preconditioner that accelerates the convergence via multigrid decomposition of the MMSE problem matrix into a hierarchy of progressively coarser problems. The proposed synergistic equalization design circumvents the need for direct matrix inversion by utilizing the residual-based efficient iteration technique of TFQMR and achieves convergence through AMG’s hierarchical estimation of the regularized channel system. Simulation results prove that the HGRAE approach achieves a superior Bit Error Rate (BER) performance level and enhanced convergence rate and reduced complexity when compared to the state-of-the-art equalizers, specifically in high mobility scenarios, and it proves to be a promising OTFS-based system to be deployed in the next generation of wireless communication networks.},

  abstract     = {Offshore production of hydrogen using seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) technologies offers a promising pathway for green hydrogen generation from renewable energy sources (RESs). Realising this potential requires the integration of the SWRO unit and PEM electrolyser into a single system, with precise modelling to address the variability of RESs. Nevertheless, there are limited studies in the literature that examine a coupled SWRO-PEM electrolyser model. Therefore, in this article, an integrated SWRO-PEM electrolyser model is developed, detailing the modelling steps for each component. The models are subsequently validated against experimental data and upscaled to reflect a realistic scenario. Finally, a straightforward control method for the SWRO unit based on the electrolyser operation is suggested. The PEM electrolyser model showed an average relative error of 0.66% in static operation and 3.93% in dynamic operation. Meanwhile, the SWRO unit demonstrated an average relative error of 3.64% for water quantity and 1.48% for water quality compared to experimental results at low total dissolved solids (TDS) values, and 2.74% and 0.13% for water quantity and quality, respectively, at seawater TDS levels. Also, the control method estimated the water demand of the electrolyser with an average error of 1.20%.},

A building physics model including the BIPV system was incorporated and integrated within the power electronics device models. This joint model assesses the impact of surrounding conditions on power inverters and optimisers and explores various practical placement scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted under different environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of airflow rates, BIPV ventilation cavity opening dimensions, and radiation-convection ratios on the system’s thermal behavior. Results indicate that proper placement strategies with sufficient airflow can significantly enhance cooling, reduce thermal stress, and improve the lifetime of the IGBT. This is particularly evident in the case of the inverter, where the DC IGBT (IGBT in the DC-DC converter stage) located in an isolated ceiling has a reduced lifetime of 9.8 % compared to an inverter placed in a utility room. This work provides valuable insights for the design and optimisation of BIPV systems in real-world applications, aiming to improve the operational lifespan of the systems.},

SPD-LKA-YOLO4H integrates Space-to-Depth convolution (SPD-Conv) to preserve fine-grained details and Large Kernel Attention (LKA) to enhance global and local feature representations. A further refined variant, SPD-LKA-YOLO4H-CBAM, incorporates a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to refine the feature selection and suppress noise. A high-resolution detection head is also included to improve small object detection. The extensive evaluation on a combination of controlled and challenging real-world sonar datasets demonstrated consistent performance improvements. Specifically, the SPD-LKA-YOLO4H model achieved superior performance on a real-world dataset, demonstrating its generalization ability with a strong balance of accuracy and speed. The SPD-LKA-YOLO4H-CBAM model, although slightly slower, achieved a 13.21% gain in mAP@50–95 on the complex UATD dataset, making it ideal for tasks requiring high precision. The study also highlighted that the efficacy of these enhancements is highly sensitive to module placement, underscoring the critical role of architectural optimization.

Owing to the compact size of wearable devices, their close proximity to the human body, and the requirement for multi-band communication, the antenna design faces multiple challenges, including size miniaturization, frequency reconfigurability, flexible beam switching, and compliance with human safety regulations. In the sub-6 GHz antenna, the switch of the diode causes the sub-6 GHz antenna to form a short circuit and an open circuit to achieve the frequency switching effect. Millimeter-wave antennas use a DC voltage to allow the diode to change the direction of current flow to form a circuit switching effect to achieve beam switching for 6 antennas, and 11 modes of beams are realized through different diode switches. The signal is fed into the antenna through the GCPW with a center feed, which reduces signal transmission losses and allows the antenna to maintain good operating bandwidth when the diode is operating in the on/off function. Finally, the proposed D-band monopole antenna at the top layer of the wearable device has upward radiation and near-field communication performance. The sub-6 GHz antenna can be used for multi-frequency switching applications when the diode operates the switching function. The millimeter-wave antenna can keep the same operating range when the diode is turned on in any state. When the diode switch is turned on, 360° beam switching can be achieved. D-band monopole antennas have the ability to not interfere with other antennas by being located on the uppermost layer and radiating upwards. In order to ensure that the proposed antenna is in compliance with the International Organization on Radiation (IOR) regulations, the effects of the proposed antenna on the human body under various modes of electromagnetic waveforms are investigated by simulating the absorbed power ratios and power densities in the human body. The antenna can be used for wearable devices in sub-6 GHz, millimeter-wave band and D-band.},

Results show an improvement in the robot’s ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control strategy.

  abstract     = {Ultrasound image denoising is a promising approach to improving visualization quality and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, with speckle noise removal remaining a central focus in medical imaging research over recent decades. Among various denoising techniques, the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter is especially appealing for ultrasound images since it provides an effective noise reduction while preserving edges and fine anatomical structures—critical for clinical interpretation. However, the classical SG filter and alternative approaches suffer from under-smoothing and over-smoothing issues due to in-optimal regularization coefficient. Then, the noise can be risks leaving unfiltered or the structural details may be blurred. In this paper, we propose Automated Elastic Regularized Savitzky–Golay (AERSG) filter which augments the conventional Savitzky–Golay (SG) framework with an adaptive Tikhonov regularization mechanism to determine the regularization coefficient automatically via the L-curve curvature maximization criterion. Then, the AERSG filter dynamically adjusts smoothing strength according to local image characteristics, effectively suppressing speckle noise while maintaining edges and fine anatomical features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional SG and regularized SG methods in balancing noise suppression and edge preservation, making it particularly suitable for high-precision medical ultrasound imaging.},

  abstract     = {Diversity measures employed in blind source separation methods typically exploit single statistical properties such as independence, sparsity, or temporal structure. This limits their effectiveness when underlying sources exhibit diverse statistical behaviors, which results in suboptimal separation performance. Although some recent studies have explored multiple statistical properties through single or multi-objective optimization, most methods remain constrained to exploiting at most two properties. To address this limitation, we propose a unified statistical properties framework named bi-dimensional and multi-statistical (BDMS) for source separation that simultaneously exploits spatial regularization and multiple spatial statistical characteristics through unified temporal optimization. The proposed method integrates spatial regularization through adaptive soft thresholding and a unified temporal optimization framework combining three statistical diversity measures (kurtosis, spectral entropy, Hoyer sparsity) with reconstruction fidelity constraints. Spatial properties are integrated through magnitude-matched gradient descent with performance-based optimized weighting factors that systematically balance the contribution of each statistical measure and reconstruction fidelity. Additionally, domain-specific post-processing enhances robustness by including discrete cosine transform basis expansion for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) temporal smoothness. The proposed framework demonstrates superior separation accuracy and robustness to noise and strong spatiotemporal dependencies compared to single and dual-property methods and maintains computational efficiency. Experimental validation on synthetic and real fMRI datasets demonstrates 19.5% improvement in source recovery accuracy and 2.6 times faster execution time compared to SICA-EBM (dual property multi-objective framework) across four different experimental conditions. To ensure reproducibility, we provide the synthetic dataset and complete source code at https://github.com/usmankhalid06/BDMS.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces CLARiC (Contrastive Learning and Root-cause Inference with Causality), a next-generation AI framework that unifies anomaly detection, causal inference, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to advance the state of smart manufacturing. Unlike existing methods limited to correlation-based insights or opaque “black-box” models, CLARiC stands out in four key ways. First, it employs multimodal contrastive learning—fusing sensor streams, text logs, and images—to robustly distinguish normal from anomalous data, even under severe class imbalance or shifting operational conditions. Second, the approach extends beyond correlation by integrating causal inference (e.g., propensity score matching, difference-in-differences), thereby identifying high-impact factors that genuinely drive process deviations. Third, through counterfactual simulations in the learned embedding space and controlled real-world interventions, CLARiC verifies whether modifying specific parameters actually enhances manufacturing outcomes—reducing defects, boosting yield, and mitigating equipment drifts. Finally, the framework’s built-in XAI components deliver transparent, fine-grained explanations, enabling domain experts to trace anomalies back to root causes with clear causal pathways rather than post-hoc guesswork. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm robust representation learning and consistent causal predictions across heterogeneous environments. Empirically, CLARiC lowered real-line abnormal rates by 34 % in a 30-day WBG semiconductor trial and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline by ≈ 3 percentage points in accuracy and F1-score, underscoring its effectiveness from wide-band-gap semiconductors to automotive assembly lines. By bridging anomaly detection, interpretability, and validated causal interventions, CLARiC offers a decisive step forward in industrial AI for mission-critical manufacturing.},

However, the decentralized and heterogeneous nature of IoT-enabled CPS increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks, including unauthorized access and probing attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in CPS commonly employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, typically trained in centralized learning (CL) or federated learning (FL) settings. Both approaches, however, face significant challenges due to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of IoT data, particularly under data and label skew conditions, which adversely affect model convergence and detection performance. While existing studies have primarily focused on data skew, the combined impact of data and label skew remains underexplored. Moreover, prior evaluations have relied on limited performance metrics, providing an incomplete understanding of learning behavior and system robustness. This study addresses these gaps through a comprehensive evaluation of CL and FL for IDS in IoT-enabled CPS under both IID and non-IID conditions, with an emphasis on data and label skew scenarios. Performance is assessed using an extended set of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, training loss, test loss, and client-level fairness indicators such as F1-score variance and fairness gap (ΔF1-score) across clients. Experimental results show FL outperforms CL in IID settings with better accuracy and stability. In non-IID environments, FL is vulnerable, especially with label skew, leading to poor convergence, lower accuracy, and more client disparity, even with complex models. While FL handles data skew moderately, it struggles with label imbalance and client dropout. These findings highlight limitations of standard FL in heterogeneous IoT deployments and emphasize the need for fairness-aware, client-adaptive learning for robust intrusion detection in real-world CPS.},

  abstract     = {Accurate building footprint extraction from high-resolution imagery is essential for rural infrastructure planning, disaster response, and supporting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {To address electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure concerns and enhance network performance, this work proposes an energy efficiency (EE) optimization algorithm for 5G networks operating in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted environments, considering both power and EMF exposure constraints. The algorithm tackles the challenge of maximizing a constrained EE utility function in multi-active RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by introducing a joint transmit and reflect beamforming approach. Specifically, EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming weights and RIS reflection coefficients under stringent power and EMF exposure limitations. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, a novel algorithm is developed to decouple the optimization variables, with its convergence behavior thoroughly validated. A quadratic transform technique is utilized, introducing a coverage identifier vector to recast the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems solvable using the CVX toolbox. Simulation results demonstrate that integrating RIS significantly boosts energy efficiency, with the performance gap between RIS-assisted and non-RIS scenarios widening over iterations, ultimately achieving a 31.7% improvement compared to systems without RIS. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving 3.3% and 4.8% higher EE than the Truncated and Boosted beamforming (TBBF) and Equalized beamforming (EBF) techniques, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Interrupt request (IRQ) handling is a crucial capability of modern computing systems that greatly affects system functionality and responsiveness. The necessity of OS intervention for IRQ handling is a system performance bottleneck. Existing OS solutions have no direct improvement on interrupt latency, i.e., the interval between IRQ occurrence and handler invocation. In this paper, we propose the Immediate Response by Interrupt Caching (IRIC) mechanism to reduce the interrupt latency by eliminating OS intervention. We observe that, in many workloads, there is a strong correlation among interrupts, and the currently occurring interrupts are likely to come from the same sources as the recent interrupts. We name this phenomenon interrupt locality, which refers to the tendency of interrupts to originate from the same sources in a short period. Based on this discovery, we propose a caching mechanism that stores the required information for the next IRQs inside the processor for immediate interrupt handling on a match. IRIC monitors the sequence of all IRQs using a tiny history table and loads the program counter with the handler address on a match after saving the processor state. This mechanism eliminates the need for OS intervention in handling the interrupts by caching their required information. The system protection in our general solution is guaranteed by enabling the OS to dynamically designate the list of trustful handlers in advance to take advantage of IRIC. The proposed mechanism shortens the interrupt latency by an average of 76.9% compared to the OS mechanism and decreases the standard deviation by 57.6%, which results in a significantly lower jitter and up to 2.4x speedup in workload execution. The improvements come at low hardware overhead.},

  abstract     = {The interconnection of smart medical devices is becoming an important trend in healthcare. As the demand for health monitoring continues to grow, the battery run time on which these devices primarily rely is challenged. Due to the differences in task requirements and power reserves of smart medical device clusters, if some devices run out of energy prematurely, it may lead to a decrease in the performance and reliability of the whole system, which makes it particularly important to globally optimize the battery run time state of smart medical device clusters. This paper proposes a task migration strategy for the battery run time collaborative optimization of smart medical device clusters. Firstly, a feature factor of device run time is proposed to evaluate the difference in the distribution of remaining power and pending tasks in the device cluster. Secondly, each device regulates the local scheduling according to the feature factor, so the dominant device reserves more free time for task migration. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy is proposed, where a graph neural network embeds graph features on the feature factor and its associated device features and sub-task features. The task migration actions are selected based on the graph features for collaborative optimization of battery run time for smart medical device clusters. Validated in the distributed medical device lithium-ion battery drive hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform, the results show that in the cluster with balanced battery run time, the proposed method effectively extends the overall battery run time of the cluster by up to 4.35%. In the cluster with unbalanced battery run time, the proposed method can effectively extend the battery run time of the cluster by more than 19.5%.},

In this work, we present a signal-processing-driven framework that integrates scalp EEG and intracranial ECoG signals using Dynamic Exponential Log Time Warping (DELTW) for temporal alignment and a robust artifact suppression method, Skewness Independent Percentile Kurtosis Analysis (SIPKA). The aligned multimodal signals are decomposed using a Discrete Lyapunov ExponentsWavelet Transform (DLEWT) to extract nonlinear dynamical features associated with seizure activity. The proposed method was evaluated on the CHB-MIT EEG and OpenNeuro ECoG datasets. Compared to baseline methods, the DELTW-aligned fusion achieved an accuracy of 96.1%, an AUC of 0.92, and an AUC-PR of 0.90 while reducing the false alarm rate to 0.17 h−1 and the mean detection latency to 4.6 s. Statistical significance testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) confirmed that these improvements were significant (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that combining DELTW-based alignment, SIPKA artifact rejection, and DLEWT-based nonlinear features can substantially enhance seizure detection accuracy and reduce false alarms without requiring deep learning models, offering a computationally efficient solution suitable for clinical deployment.},

This work presents a methodology for classifying foot types using ML algorithms, requiring minimal information to be effective. Ten algorithms were trained on a dataset of 626 images and evaluated using a test set of 268 images. Hyper-parameter tuning of ten algorithms is achieved through Bayesian Optimization (BO), utilizing a descriptor based on the attention mechanism of a vision transformer. The results obtained by optimizing the Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) with BO are promising for flatfoot disease, achieving an accuracy greater than 95% in foot type classification. The methodology is also implemented in biomedical datasets to compare the results obtained with Flatfoot and define a methodology that provides good results for the type of flatfoot images analyzed.},

Establish a high-frequency perceptual loss function to guide the network to focus on texture defects and structurally blurry areas, improving depth prediction accuracy. In addition, adopting a knowledge distillation strategy from a pretrained external teacher network, which transfers both global semantic context and fine-grained geometric cues to the student model, enhances generalization ability in different environments.

Crucially, these methods focus solely on 2D reconstruction without mechanisms to control pseudo-LiDAR quality. To address this, we propose a novel depth-completion network that jointly predicts a dense depth map and a per-pixel confidence map. The confidence map enables selective back-projection by filtering out unreliable estimates during pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generation. Furthermore, as LiDAR returns exhibit increasing sparsity at longer ranges, our confidence map learns to prioritize reliable long-range estimates. This learned compensation mechanism mitigates sensor limitations while enhancing detection performance for distant objects. On the KITTI 3D benchmark, detectors trained on our pseudo-LiDAR outperform those using raw 32-channel data by 14.2% in 3D AP, narrowing the gap to full 64-channel sensors by 63%.},

The proposed approach integrates six key phases: IP discovery (1), DNS verification (2), port, protocol and service identification (3), operating system profiling (4), web application analysis (5), and comprehensive risk assessment using a customized risk matrix (6). This study contributes by (1) conducting a systematic literature review to identify gaps in existing ICS security frameworks, (2) developing a structured methodology for risk assessment across different ICS lifecycle phases, (3) applying the methodology to a real-world case study to validate its effectiveness, and (4) demonstrating its capability to systematically identify vulnerabilities, quantify risks, and provide actionable security insights. The results reveal critical security gaps, such as outdated software and unencrypted communication channels, emphasizing the need for improved security controls. By quantifying the attack surface and assessing risk levels, the proposed model enables stakeholders to prioritize remediation efforts effectively. The findings highlight the urgent need for proactive security measures in ICS environments, reinforcing the importance of continuous monitoring and risk mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructures against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).},

  abstract     = {With advancements in information and communication technology (ICT), the use of big data has become increasingly prevalent, particularly in the power industry. This study proposes a novel data synthesis methodology to enable the secure sharing and utilization of data containing personal information while retaining the utility of the original data. To model the key components of electricity consumption data, a segmented seasonal trend decomposition using loess (STL) synthesis methodology is proposed, focusing on capturing temporal patterns and characteristics. Segmented STL synthesizes electricity consumption data by segmenting into smaller units and using Gaussian process regression (GPR) and generalized extreme value (GEV) models to effectively capture temporal patterns while enhancing privacy protection. A comparative analysis was conducted on row-wise shuffling, segment-unit row-wise shuffling, and the proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using various metrics, including population stability index (PSI), principal component analysis (PCA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). In addition, a case study was conducted to determine whether the proposed method properly estimates the potential of a demand response service. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively reflects the time-series characteristics and electricity usage patterns of the actual data with an error margin within 0.1% while providing a high level of privacy protection.},

To address the challenges posed by the unknown nonstrict terms (each involving all state variables), fuzzy systems are employed for function approximation. Specifically, a novel fuzzy basis function inequality is developed to enlarge the modulus of the fuzzy system in a way that restricts its dependence to only the first i state variables. This facilitates a smooth implementation of the backstepping design. Furthermore, by introducing switching functions, a switching controller is constructed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error within a predetermined time. The controller ensures that the absolute tracking error eventually falls below a prescribed positive threshold, thereby achieving practical finite-time stability for the NFS. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed control scheme.},

The proposed model introduces a dynamic field superposition structure driven by Gaussian kernel functions, enabling intuitive three-dimensional visualization of congestion propagation. To meet the demands of real-time urban mobility management, we design a spatial parallel processing architecture that significantly improves computational speed while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Empirical validation using large-scale real-world traffic data demonstrates that our model improves prediction accuracy by 26.2% over standard LSTM methods while reducing CPU usage by 75%. Moreover, the proposed framework supports a dual-driven decision paradigm by linking micro-level driver behavior with macro-level congestion evolution, offering interpretable insights for smart traffic control policies such as dynamic lane assignment and variable speed limits.

  abstract     = {Cognitive impairment, which commonly occurs after stroke, adversely impacts rehabilitation outcomes. The administration of traditional screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can be challenging for patients with communication or motor limitations. This study aimed to determine whether routinely collected functional assessments can effectively predict cognitive impairment in stroke patients undergoing robotic-assisted gait training with the Lokomat system. In this retrospective analysis, data from 274 stroke patients who received Lokomat-based rehabilitation were examined. Patients with complete data on the MMSE, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were included in the final analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score < 24. Five supervised machine learning models—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost—were developed to classify cognitive status using FMA, MBI, and TUG as predictors. The performance of each model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Logistic regression demonstrated the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.92, accuracy = 89.5%), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.88) and XGBoost (AUC = 0.87). FMA was identified as the most significant predictor in tree-based models. Patients classified as cognitively impaired exhibited significantly lower functional scores than their unimpaired counterparts (p < 0.001). Functional assessments routinely performed during stroke rehabilitation can provide a practical and accurate method for identifying cognitive impairment, especially when cognitive screening is constrained. These results support the incorporation of machine learning–based tools into clinical decision-making during robotic rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. To detect active lesions in this disease, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These materials can have side effects for the patient after several injections. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning methods to detect active lesions in MRI images without using contrast agents. Our data included 9097 lesions from 130 patients from four different imaging centers. First, the lesions were identified, and each one was separated from the images as a patch. Texture features were also calculated for each lesion. Then, the study was conducted based on the input type in three different phases, including image intensity, texture features, and the combination of image intensity and texture features. In each phase, a proper CNN network was designed. In addition, 13 pre-trained CNN networks were also applied to predict lesions in the third phase. The ensemble technique was another method used in this phase to categorize lesions. Additionally, inter-center variability and cross-center generalizability assessment analyses were conducted to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. The statistical results for the designed network of the first phase were obtained as an accuracy value of 85%, specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 74%, and AUC of 0.90. These values for the second phase were 77%, 90%, 63%, and 0.85, respectively, and for the third phase, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 0.94, respectively. Among the pre-trained networks in the third phase, the EfficientNetV2M showed the best performance with an average accuracy of 88%, specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 86%, and AUC of 0.92. This study indicates that while using image intensity and texture features separately effectively distinguishes active from inactive lesions, their combination yields even better results.},

The proposed structure is shown to produce stable, chattering-free estimations while maintaining a well-damped transient response. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that the steady-state estimation error for the j-th derivative is O(T + ϵ/λ), where T is the sampling period, ϵ is the smoothing parameter, and λ is a tunable gain. The effectiveness of the proposed differentiator is validated through extensive simulations. In noise-free scenarios, it achieves high-precision estimation up to the sixth derivative for various signals—a feat rarely demonstrated in the literature. Furthermore, its robustness is confirmed under measurement noise, where the algorithm maintains stability and accurately tracks the true derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Gallium Nitride (GaN) Gate-All-Around (GAA) FETs are developed to be promising candidates for high-frequency, superfast circuitry and RF applications mainly due to their superior electron mobility and wide bandgap. A variety of GaN GAA FETs are developed incorporating gate underlap, spacer technology and source/drain engineering. A comprehensive analysis of DC and AC/RF performance parameters of high-k spacer-wrapped underlap-induced GaN GAA FETs with source and drain enlargements are attained. The impact of this spacer engineering on threshold voltage (Vth), drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), subthreshold swing (SS), ON-current (IOn), leakage current (IOff), and switching speed (IOn/IOff) are systematically evaluated. It is inevitably determined that integrating a high-K spacer substantially improves electrostatic control, thereby mitigates short-channel effects while achieve a near ideal SS of ~62 mV/decade. A refined underlap design with high-k wrapping effectively subdues fringing field effects by reducing parasitic capacitances and resistances acquiring cut-off frequency of ~7.2 THz, improves AC performances. The underlap region suppresses DIBL, maintaining excellent gate control while achieving a higher IOn/IOff ratio of ~19×108 instigating development of the novel device for superfast circuitry applications. The analysis is calibrated and validated with experimentally fabricated devices while Vth is analytically modelled. Comparison with existing research and proposed IRDS 2028 of 1.5 nm technology node shows the underlap-induced GaN GAA FET is advantageous, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing power dissipation, and enhancing switching performance. These findings confirm the design is well-suited for next-generation low-power, high-performance, superfast circuitry and RF applications offering superior energy efficiency and reliability in ultra-scaled transistor architectures.},

The goal is to optimize the average utility of the synthesized beam pattern. The analysis is based on full-wave electromagnetic field theory and its analytical solutions. In particular, we make use of the theory of multiple scattering to model the electromagnetic interactions between the RIS elements. We consider three geometries of the receiver array: (a) linear, (b) wedge-like, and (c) circular. The scattering elements in the arrays are taken to be circular cylinders of infinite length, so that the model is effectively two-dimensional.

This study presents a hybrid extractive QA model tailored for Kazakh, a morphologically complex and digitally underrepresented language, by integrating dense retrieval mechanisms with ontology-based semantic prefixing mechanism. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on retrieval and reading comprehension, our architecture injects dynamically constructed semantic definitions for domain-specific terms into the answer context, enabling more profound understanding and improved accuracy. Leveraging a novel dataset of Kazakh QA pairs generated through GPT-4 with expert validation, we introduce a dual-stream hybrid model (Hybrid B) that combines ontology-driven enrichment with fine-tuned transformer models for the retriever and reader components. The proposed system achieves a significant leap in performance, with 88% F1 and 76% exact match scores, substantially outperforming established baselines, including KazQAD. By anchoring the QA pipeline in a custom-built educational ontology relevant to the target domain, this research demonstrates how semantic structure can compensate for linguistic and data scarcity, paving the way for scalable QA systems in other low-resource languages such as Turkish. Beyond its empirical results, the study contributes a reproducible and modular framework for retrieval-augmented, ontology-aware QA, with implications for educational platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, and domain-specific information access. Through this work, we argue that the future of multilingual QA lies in hybrid architectures that combine symbolic structure with neural adaptability.},

Firstly, the preprocessing of synchronized sound and photoelectric signals are achieved through L2 norm, logarithmic normalization, and grayscale image conversion. Then, a lightweight model is formed by combining depth-wise separable convolution (DSC) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently recognize the fusion state.

However, its direct application to the complex domain of histopathological images—where multiple tissue and cellular features co-occur—remains underexplored. In this study, we propose HistoCLIP, a CLIP-driven framework for the multilabel classification of histopathological images. At its core is cross-modal matching learning that fuses class-specific text embeddings—generated from a zero-shot classifier built on a set of carefully designed prompt templates—with visual features extracted by a frozen CLIP encoder. Specifically, the text embeddings function as queries, whereas the image features serve as keys and values in a multihead cross-attention module, enabling the model to relearn and redefine the alignment between linguistic and visual modalities. We evaluated the proposed HistoCLIP on two tissue-level benchmarks (BCSS-WSSS and LUAD-HistoSeg) and a cell-level multilabel dataset (PanNuke). The experimental results show that the proposed HistoCLIP achieves category average accuracies of 91.21 % on BCSS-WSSS, 95.07 % on LUAD-HistoSeg, and 88.24 % on PanNuke, respectively, significantly surpassing existing CLIP-based shallow multilayer perceptron head fine-tuned methods and pathology-pretrained models.

By directly inferring patient similarities from data, IPFL enables personalized model training without requiring assumptions about cluster structures or interpolation with a global model. We validate IPFL on two real-world healthcare tasks: epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia detection, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that IPFL naturally leads to interpretable collaboration graphs: patients with similar disease characteristics tend to collaborate more frequently.},

  abstract     = {Deep Learning (DL) detects intrusions in Industry 4.0 applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) since it can grasp complex patterns from large datasets and identify irregularities. Current DL-based techniques for IoT-based Industry 4.0 suffer from catastrophic forgetting, computational inefficiency, security and privacy concerns, and false positive predictions. A new intrusion detection method for Industry 4.0 systems employing Evolving Continual DL (ECDL) addresses these issues. Model flexibility, accuracy, computational efficiency, security, and privacy are ECDL goals. ECDL includes local IoT model data gathering, pre-processing, feature engineering, and classification. In pre-processing, the problem of missing values and noisy data is addressed, and then it is normalized to facilitate the training process. In ECDL, each IoT model pre-processes and trains locally obtained data with advanced DL layers. The methodology is adaptable since the proposed DL layers are connected with Incremental Learning (IL), allowing for the integration of new IoT data and learning without the need for extensive re-training. The locally trained models are sent to the global model, where the Federated Learning (FL) technique is employed for aggregation. FL-based trained model disseminated to each local IoT model and SoftMax classifier for intrusion detection. In ECDL, FL with IL trains feature learning locally and adaptively in dynamic IoT contexts, resulting in complete efficiency. Implemented in real time using relevant IoT datasets, ECDL is assessed for accuracy, computational complexity, model flexibility, security, and privacy. Each IoT model uses Raspberry Pi, and the global server model uses Jetson Xavier. ECDL has 3.9% greater accuracy and 16.77% lower computing complexity than previous methods. The ECDL delivers effective security for Industry 4.0 design and implementation with model flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Palmprint verification systems have shown great potential as a reliable biometric modality due to their distinctiveness and stability. However, developing robust palmprint verification models requires large-scale and diverse training data, which is often difficult to acquire. This paper investigates the effectiveness of leveraging synthetic palmprint data for enhancing the performance and generalization capabilities of palmprint verification systems. We utilize the PCE-Palm, a novel two-stage synthetic palmprint generation method that transforms parametric Bézier curves into realistic palmprint images via an intermediate Palm Crease Energy (PCE) domain, to generate 1.6 million synthetic palmprint samples representing 50,000 subjects. Our approach involves pretraining deep learning models on synthetic data followed by fine-tuning on real palmprint datasets. We propose a Region of Interest (ROI) extraction method based on circular fitting for accurate palmprint region localization and employ EfficientNetV2 with Circle Loss for feature extraction and classification. Extensive experiments across ten diverse public palmprint datasets demonstrate that models pretrained on synthetic data significantly outperform models initialized with ImageNet weights. Specifically, our synthetic data-driven approach achieves superior results with Equal Error Rates (EER) as low as 0.0026 on COEP, 0.0045 on IITD, 0.0046 on TCD, and 0.0622 on PolyU_V2 datasets. These results highlight the potential of synthetic data for improving the generalization and robustness of palmprint verification systems across various acquisition conditions and population demographics.},

In real-time status monitoring systems, like smart warehouses, quantifying the freshness of the Internet of Things (IoT) data based on the age of information (AoI) metrics becomes quite crucial. As source nodes are battery-constrained, a balanced trade-off between AoI minimization and preservation of source node battery energy is essential. In this paper, in a smart warehouse scenario, we address the problem of minimization of the average weighted sum of AoI subject to the available energy constraint of each source node. We focus on joint optimization of packet transmission and energy may not be suitable for finding a solution in a reasonable time. To address the issue, we develop a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm that enables us to a simultaneous reduction of the state-space dimension with learning of the age-optimal policy in unknown environmental dynamics. Taking account into the limited energy constraints of the user nodes, the proposed DQN algorithm aims to minimize the long-term average weighted sum-AoI of the user-transmitted data. Finally, we produce multifaceted simulation results in terms of convergence, learning process, and change of average sum-AoI under different energy constraints that shows the effectiveness of the proposed DQN algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Early detection and accurate diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images remain challenging due to subtle pathological alterations across multiple retinal layers. In this paper, we present Fused-AETNet (Fused AutoEncoder–Transformer Network), a novel deep-learning framework that uniquely combines clinically interpretable handcrafted OCT biomarkers with a robust variational autoencoder and a transformer-based classifier. Unlike prior OCT–DR approaches that directly utilize raw intensities or generic CNN-derived features, our method begins with precise segmentation of eleven retinal layers in the central OCT B-scan using an atlas-guided probabilistic approach. From each layer, we extract three clinically validated morphological descriptors—reflectivity, Laplacian-based thickness, and boundary tortuosity—and summarize them through percentile-based Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) to capture regional variability in a compact, size-invariant form. These descriptors are fused into a smooth latent embedding via variational autoencoding, enabling robust modelling of cross-layer dependencies and uncertainty. The latent space is then refined using a lightweight transformer-inspired attention module that selectively amplifies diagnostically relevant embeddings while suppressing irrelevant variations. This biomarker-driven design enhances both the specificity and interpretability of the diagnostic decision process. Our training employs a composite loss function that jointly enforces accurate descriptor reconstruction, latent space regularization, and high classification accuracy. We validated the framework on OCT scans from 481 subjects, achieving superior performance compared to traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art deep networks, with an average accuracy of 93.08% ± 4.21, precision of 93.33% ± 4.84, recall of 96.00% ± 5.96, and F1 score of 94.48% ± 3.21. By explicitly modelling layer-wise biomarkers and integrating attention-guided latent feature selection, Fused-AETNet offers a compact, interpretable, and clinically relevant solution for OCT-based DR diagnosis.},

This paper proposes a novel Inception-ViT hybrid model for Locomotion mode recognition based on hip, knee, and ankle joint angle data collected from six IMU sensors. The study focuses on five motion patterns: level ground walking (LW), stair ascent (SA), stair descent (SD), ramp ascent (RA), and ramp descent (RD). we employ variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose raw joint angle signals into three intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and generate enhanced features by subtracting different IMF combinations. In the feature extraction stage, Inception convolutional layers are first utilized to extract local features. Subsequently, global feature modeling is performed through an improved Vision Transformer (ViT), where traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers are replaced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to strengthen the model’s nonlinear fitting capability. To validate the effectiveness of the model, comparative experiments were conducted with traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), standard ViT, and Inception models. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, noise resistance, and generalization capability for Locomotion mode recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully captures both local and global dynamic information of locomotion modes. It achieves recognition accuracy exceeding 98% across all motion patterns (average 98.92%), confirming its superior performance in motion pattern recognition.},

  abstract     = {In multi-step Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Question Answering (QA), the re-ranking phase following initial fast document retrieval is critical in determining the final answer quality by providing the most relevant context passages. This step typically relies on the ranking of candidate documents using deep neural network classification models that assign relevance scores based on their prediction probabilities. However, conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers often generate poorly calibrated probability estimates when minimizing prediction loss. This miscalibration leads to inaccurate document rankings, undermining the reliability of the re-ranking stage. To address this issue, we propose the Evidential Document Re-Ranking (EDRR) model, which leverages Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to better calibrate the prediction probabilities to true accuracies and thus provide better ranking performances. EDRR enables better calibration by simply modeling the full posterior distribution over class probabilities, which alleviates the overconfidence problem observed in DNN models. In addition, this approach facilitates active learning by identifying uncertain predictions, allowing for more effective sampling of diverse or underrepresented instances. Experimental results on the Wikipedia-NQ, MSMARCO, and HotpotQA datasets show that EDRR consistently outperforms Cross-Encoder, ColBERT, and Dense Passage Retrieval, achieving the highest mAP@10 scores across all three benchmarks. This demonstrates that incorporating well-calibrated uncertainty estimates can meaningfully enhance retrieval performance in the QA systems.},

The optimal number of clusters was determined using validation techniques, including the Elbow method, Silhouette Coefficient, and confusion matrix analysis, ensuring strong cluster cohesion and separation under non-standard operating conditions. The clustering process revealed four distinct clusters. Subsequently, the Cuckoo Search (CS) optimization technique was applied to fine-tune relay settings within representative network topologies from each cluster, optimizing the Time Multiplier Settings (TMS) to minimize relay tripping times while maintaining system reliability. Comparative analyses demonstrated that non-standard relay characteristics significantly improved fault detection and protection coordination compared to standard ones. To validate the proposed methodologies, both ETAP simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing were conducted, achieving effective Coordination Time Intervals (CTI) in real-time scenarios. The detailed setup, procedures, and validation results of the HIL experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed scheme under realistic operating conditions.

Next, the impact of wireless channel coefficients correlation on the performance metrics using Copula theory, as the most convenientway for describing the dependence between several variables, is investigated. By applying the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) Copula function, we obtain closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) under positive/negative dependence conditions. It is shown that the fading correlation improves the OP for a negative dependence structure.

  abstract     = {Using a high signal-to-noise ratio remote microphone (RM) with hearing aids (HAs) is advantageous for HA users. However, the benefit depends significantly on the properties of the wireless channel. In contrast to reality, existing literature often assumes an error-free and instantaneous wireless transmission channel. In reality, however, wireless transmission of audio typically undergoes latency, which introduces a time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the local HA microphone signals and the wirelessly transmitted RM signal received at the HA. We first observe that, as the distance between the HAs and the RM increases, the TDOAs decrease, making the signals received from a distant RM more beneficial than those from a nearby RM. Next, we propose two methods to combine aRMsignal with the HA, under realistic TDOAs. Acting in either the complex spectral domain or the magnitude spectral domain, the methods make a binary selection in each time-frequency tile between minimum mean-square-error estimates determined from the HA microphone signals and RM signal, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the resulting estimate in terms of their signal quality and speech intelligibility using objective and subjective tests. We show that the proposed methods outperform their baselines that use only HA signals, for TDOAs in the range of 30-60 ms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, several personalized assistants based on AI have been researched and developed to help users make privacy-related decisions. These AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants (AI-driven PPAs) can provide significant benefits for users, who might otherwise struggle with making decisions about their personal data in online environments that often overload them with different privacy decision requests. So far, no studies have systematically investigated the emerging topic of AI-driven PPAs, classifying their underlying technologies, architecture and features, including decision types or the accuracy of their decisions. To fill this gap, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to map the existing solutions found in the scientific literature, which allows reasoning about existing approaches and open challenges for this research field. We screened several hundred unique research papers over the recent years (2013-2025), constructing a classification from 41 included papers. As a result, this SLR reviews several aspects of existing research on AI-driven PPAs in terms of types of publications, contributions, methodological quality, and other quantitative insights. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs, delving into their architectural choices, system contexts, types of AI used, data sources, types of decisions, and control over decisions, among other facets. Based on our SLR, we further underline the research gaps and challenges and formulate recommendations for the design and development of AI-driven PPAs as well as avenues for future research.},

  abstract     = {Iraq is struggling with a significant electricity crisis, especially in rural and remote areas where ensuring uninterrupted and reliable power access remains a long–standing problem. The electrical grid of the country is under growing pressure to meet expanding demand, as it continues to be heavily reliant on fossil fuel–based generation. Mini–grids with hybrid renewable energy sources may represent a promising sustainable solution, particularly for rural areas. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of hybrid mini–grid power systems for electrifying rural areas in Iraq. The focus is on identifying the most cost–effective and reliable system through size optimization as well as techno–economic and sensitivity analyses using HOMER software. Comprehensive assessments are conducted on multiple system types, such as technical, economic, electrical, and environmental analyses, reinforced by thorough sensitivity studies on key parameters such as fuel cost, system reliability, and the nominal discount rate. The hybrid system configuration, comprising a 666 kW of solar PV array, 47 wind turbines (WTs), a 2,000 kW large diesel generator, a 600 kW small diesel generator, 864 kWh of battery storage, and a 699 kW power converter, offers the optimal balance of cost, environmental impact, and reliability among all feasible options. It achieved a net present cost of $9.13 million and a cost of energy of $0.123/kWh. The results show that the integration of solar PV and WTs with diesel generators could provide cost–effective and reliable solutions to address the electricity shortage problem in Iraq. The analyses and insights presented in this paper may assist decision makers in Iraq by highlighting the strategic advantages of utilizing renewable energy sources, aiming to diversify power generation sources in the country.},

This research investigates the evolving landscape of HRO decision-making principles across industries, evaluating which sectors successfully implement these models, the key features of the models proposed, and the benefits and challenges of such implementations. The study divides industries into two groups: those that focus on practical implementation through case studies and process reviews, and those proposing theoretical models for future implementation. A systematic literature review process was conducted resulting in the inclusion and analysis of fifty studies. This analysis explored proposed models, highlighting recurring features such as decision-making processes, resilience, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Key benefits of HRO implementation, such as improved safety, decision-making, and organizational resilience, were identified, with organizational dynamics—particularly resistance to change and leadership challenges—were cited as significant barriers to implementation. The results of this study reveal a rich array of insights, highlighting a notable shift toward the digital platform sector as a leading area for both theoretical research and the practical application of HRO principles—particularly in cloud computing, data management, and automation. The findings also emphasize a persistent gap between theoretical models and their practical implementation in technology-driven industries, underscoring the need for the development of actionable frameworks to bridge this divide. Additionally, the study introduces potential new metrics designed to support emerging technologies, not only to enhance system resilience but also to navigate complex organizational dynamics that currently hinder broader adoption of HRO models. This SLR offers original insights by emphasizing the critical need to adapt HRO frameworks to incorporate emerging technologies and shifting organizational structures, thereby enhancing decision-making effectiveness in increasingly complex and dynamic operational environments.},

To adapt these algorithms for audio signal processing, short-term power spectral analysis was used to determine the signature of fifths corresponding to a given piece. The experiments were conducted on a set of 47 piano pieces by composers from various eras, recorded on a hybrid acoustic piano equipped with an add-on that enabled the production of synchronous symbolic notation. This setup made it possible to compare the accuracy of the proposed audio key detection algorithms with that of their symbolic precursors.

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of bus arrival times is critical for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of public transportation systems. However, complex factors such as traffic congestion, weather conditions, and temporal variability make this task challenging. In this study, we propose a context-aware hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer architectures to predict stop-level bus travel times. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset collected from 500 bus routes in Istanbul, spanning six months and incorporating real-time GPS data, GTFS schedules, and hourly weather attributes. A hybrid trend component is selectively introduced for data groups with fewer than 1000 samples to mitigate overfitting under sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the trend-augmented LSTM model outperforms baseline architectures, achieving up to 28% improvement in MAE. The best-performing model yields an MAE of 2.97 minutes, a MAPE of 14.79%, and an R2 value of 0.9272 across all test routes. Furthermore, condition-based evaluations demonstrate that prediction accuracy varies significantly across different time blocks, weather conditions, and day types. The proposed approach is both scalable and adaptable, offering a robust solution for real-time transit forecasting in complex urban environments.},

This paper proposes a two-stage data augmentation framework, called Question-Answer Replacement and Removal and Question Generation and Filtering (QARR-QGF), to address this challenge. The QARR module enhances pretraining data by systematically replacing and removing question-answer pairs to create more diverse examples. During fine-tuning, the QGF module generates paraphrased questions and applies semantic filtering to retain high-quality training samples. The framework is evaluated using three widely used generative models: Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), BART, and T5, on the SQuAD, HotpotQA, and Natural Questions datasets. Experimental results show that QARR-QGF consistently improves performance across all datasets and few-shot settings. For example, the QARR-QGF-T5 model achieves F1 scores of 82.3% on SQuAD, 59.9% on HotpotQA, and 59.0% on Natural Questions in the 16-shot setting, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QARR-QGF in improving few-shot QA performance by generating richer and more diverse training data.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) often stagnates in photovoltaic (PV) parameter extraction due to premature convergence and velocity decay. This paper proposes Random Reinitialized PSO (R2-PSO), which periodically reinitializes particle positions and velocities to restore diversity and sustain exploration without disrupting convergence. Performance is evaluated using the run-length distribution (RLD), a probabilistic benchmark that jointly characterizes convergence dynamics and steady-state success. In PV parameter extraction, R2-PSO achieves RMSE = 10⁻⁹, 100% success over 100 runs, and convergence in ≈1.05M function evaluations. Experimental validation on multi-crystalline (SM55), monocrystalline (S75), and thin-film (ST40) modules shows close agreement with manufacturer datasheets. Generalization capability is confirmed through the CEC-2022 single-objective benchmark suite, where R2-PSO attains the lowest total rank and 1st overall position among five competitive PSO-based algorithms, securing best-mean performance on 8 out of 12 functions. Statistical comparisons across both application and benchmark domains indicate uniformly lower error metrics (SSE, MAE, MSE, AE, SE) relative to competing methods. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate robustness, maintaining 100% success under variations in the VTR threshold, population size, maximum velocity, and epoch initialization frequency. These results establish R2-PSO as an accurate, reliable, and computationally efficient optimizer for PV parameter extraction, while highlighting RLD as a rigorous standard for evaluating stochastic search algorithms.},

We present the Fast ETHD system, a high-speed encountered-type haptic device capable of moving at speeds over 1m/s, that was used to determine how device speed affects these factors in virtual environments. Participants played a Space Invaders type virtual reality game and provided feedback, showing that increasing encountered-type haptic device speed had a positive effect on sentiment scores for most aspects of the Presence and User Experience Questionnaires, as well as game performance in various categories. A virtual reality version of the ISO/TS 9241-411 multidirectional tapping task evaluated task performance for different haptic conditions, and found that encountered-type haptics resulted in a lower throughput (2.23 bps) than minimal flat haptics with a table (3.53 bps) and no haptics at all (3.70 bps), being attributed to the latency in the Fast ETHD system. These results can be used to improve future encountered-type haptic device designs for more realistic virtual reality experiences.},

For the model's ability to adapt to irregular hot spots and complex edges, we optimize and introduce a dynamic adaptive group convolution (AKGConv) in the P3 layer of YOLOv11 to maintain the stability of the convolution structure. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of redundant parameters of multi-scale detection head, we design a lightweight shared convolutional detection head (LSCD-Detect) to achieve feature sharing and efficient prediction, which effectively improves the discrimination ability of the model. In addition, in order to improve the convergence speed and robustness of model training, generalized IoU (GIoU) is introduced to optimize the loss. The experimental results show that, compared with the baseline model YOLOv11 on our constructed induction motor fault thermography dataset, the method in this paper reduces the number of parameters and the computational volume by 11.15% and 13.6%, respectively, while maintaining the high accuracy, which fully verifies the superiority of the method in the field of industrial automation and intelligent manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation, an essential task for applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced enormously with deep learning but still struggles in challenging conditions such as poor lighting and adverse weather. Multimodal approaches incorporating auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have emerged to address these limitations. This work introduces MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. Our approach consists of an adapter network that injects multimodal fused features into the rich RGB features of SAM. This strategy allows the model to prioritize RGB information while selectively incorporating auxiliary data when beneficial.We conduct extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks such as DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we manually divide DeLIVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard splits, to better assess the impact of employing synergistically auxiliary modalities. Our results demonstrate that the MM SAM-adapter outperforms competitors in easy and challenging scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning systems (IPS) play a vital role in applications such as navigation and asset tracking. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms on a newly introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) dataset, specifically developed for localization tasks. The dataset undergoes systematic robustness testing, including RSSI masking, added noise, and missing anchor nodes, to assess model resilience in challenging conditions. Five machine learning algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—are examined to benchmark their performance. The models are evaluated based on localization error (LE) and success rate (SR) across different accuracy thresholds, utilizing a custom dataset collected in diverse room environments. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that XGBoost and RF achieve superior accuracy and scalability compared to other methods. RF delivers strong localization accuracy with low computational overhead, while XGBoost balances high accuracy with robustness to environmental noise and partial data loss. However, challenges such as performance inconsistencies in rooms with poor signal coverage and susceptibility to signal fluctuations are noted. These findings establish a benchmark for BLE RSSI-based localization research, offering key insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning models for various real-world applications.

  abstract     = {The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for ‘‘usefulness’’, an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the input coupling problem in a shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated parallel platform characterized by fully unknown nonlinear dynamics. In such a platform, the displacement of one actuator simultaneously affects the others owing to inherent coupling effects. The convergence of coupling phenomena and the nonlinear characteristics of SMA actuators renders bidirectional swing control exceptionally challenging, particularly under conditions of unknown dynamics. To address these limitations, a model-free adaptive sliding mode control (MFA-SMC) method is proposed to improve control accuracy for complex platform motions while avoiding the intricate modeling process typically required for SMA-actuated parallel platforms. Leveraging model-free adaptive control (MFAC) theory, a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) dynamic linearized mathematical model of the parallel platform is developed using real-time input and output system data. Subsequently, a sliding mode controller is formulated based on this dynamic model. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model-free adaptive sliding mode controller can effectively and stably manage the SMA-actuated parallel platform, with its tracking error being uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Lastly, experiments are performed on the developed SMA-actuated parallel platform. The results indicate that the proposed model-free controller is both feasible and effective, enabling precise control of the system to achieve complex bidirectional swing motion.},

In our prior work [10], the role of hydrophobicity loss in intensifying surface electric field stress was established using finite element modeling. This study extends that investigation by experimentally assessing the severity and spatial variability of environmental pollution—specifically, soluble and non-soluble deposits—on field-aged 380-kV composite insulators that had been in service for over a decade. Using standardized procedures defined in IEC 60507, the Equivalent Salt Deposit Density (ESDD) and Non-Soluble Deposit Density (NSDD) were measured on individual sheds along the insulator profile to capture localized contamination patterns. Results reveal strong non-uniformity in pollution distribution, with significantly higher contamination levels on lower sheds due to gravitational runoff and environmental exposure asymmetry. Finite Element Method simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the surface electric field distribution on degraded insulators. Material properties and boundary conditions were defined to reflect field-aged conditions and shed-level pollution gradients. The electric field maps showed intensified surface stress in regions with combined effects of hydrophobicity loss and high ESDD/NSDD values, particularly near the lower sheds. Microscopic observations further confirmed contaminant accumulation and physical erosion in these high-risk regions. The findings offer a comprehensive degradation model that integrates field-contamination data with electric field intensification mechanisms. This study provides actionable insights for predictive maintenance, condition assessment, and improved insulation design under polluted service environments.},

Traditional methods exhibit low accuracy and a limited bandwidth range when confronted with conditions characterized by large bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of jamming signals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a signal bandwidth estimation algorithm based on skip connection and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) augmented mask region-convolutional neural network (SLA-Mask). The proposed SLA-Mask progressively implements skip connections in the backbone and employs a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LARS optimization strategy during training. The skip connection framework adopts a dual-path design: a feature rebuilding module with two-stage discrete wavelet transform (DWT) enhancement and a dynamic attention gated fusion (DAGF) based fusion module. This architecture can achieve accurate jamming signal detection, segmentation, and bandwidth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-Mask achieves accurate bandwidth estimation and effectively mitigates feature degradation and and oscillations during the period of large-scale training. At SNR=-10 dB, it improves the estimation accuracy by 98.7% compared with the traditional auto-correlation function (ACF) based method.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel explainable orthopaedic disease detection framework that is robust to both white-box and black-box adversarial attack examples and is based on hybrid fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM). This research addresses two critical challenges. The first issue is associated with a trusted framework that is vulnerable to multiple adversarial attacks and that can manage complex evaluation matrices. Second, selecting the best detection orthopaedic disease detection model that addresses complex multiattribute and trade-off attribute issues is lacking. The developed methodology consists of dataset identification and preprocessing, adversarial Machine Learning (ML) model development, an evaluation and benchmarking framework, and framework validation and evaluation. The dataset was augmented with edge-based techniques, improving generalizability and adversarial robustness. A comprehensive evaluation of nine ML models was conducted under four adversarial attack conditions, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Label Poisoning Method (LPM), and Model Extraction Method (MEM) attacks to increase the robustness of the developed models, and these models were evaluated via fourteen metrics. The selection and benchmarking are established via a novel decision matrix framework and the optimized Weight Fuzzy Judgment Method (WFJM) and Z-Score Multi-Attribute-Based Aggregation (Z-MABAC) method to systematically select the most robust developed model. According to the WFJM method, the fooling rate and prevalence obtained the highest average importance weights of 0.090 and 0.094, respectively, across the four attack scenarios. In contrast, specificity, precision, and Cohen’s kappa received the lowest weights, with values of 0.057, 0.058, and 0.069, respectively. The benchmarking results revealed the following top-performing models across adversarial attack scenarios: the decision tree under the LPM, the Support Vector Machine under BIM, and the Gradient Boosting model under the FGSM. Under the MEM scenario, the Random Forest ranked highest under the MEM scenario, with scores of 0.122, 0.180, 0.122 and 0.170, respectively. The final phase validates the proposed framework through sensitivity‒correlation analysis and explainability analysis via Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). This demonstrated that models such as HOG-SVM exhibited structured decision boundaries but remained somewhat susceptible to BIM attacks, reinforcing the need for adversarial training. The results underscore the importance of adversarial robustness in AI-based orthopaedic detection systems, contributing to the broader field of secure and ethical AI adoption in healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the main focus of the design process of electrical machines is typically electromagnetic analysis. However, as requirements have increased for electrical machines and drives with specific uses and higher efficiency, thermal analysis has become a more significant part of the design process. The temperature rise within a machine influences its output power and can also lead to the thermal degradation of significant parts of the machine, in particular the winding insulation and permanent magnets, if these are used in the machine construction. A precise estimate of temperature is crucial for the protection of critical machine components, which in turn requires an accurate prediction of machine temperatures. This can be achieved through various research methods, such as finite element analysis or analytical approaches, along with appropriate analysis methodologies. In this work, Lumped Parameter Thermal Networks are used. This analytical method is very convenient due to its need for low computing time and fast optimization execution. This publication focuses on the optimization of heat transfer coefficients using a genetic algorithm, which is a key factor in achieving accurate thermal analysis. Various methods for the estimation of these coefficients are evaluated and incorporated into the optimization process. In addition, graphical outputs of the calculations, including comparisons of the calculated and measured temperatures, for different methods used to approximate the heat transfer coefficients, are also presented in this paper. The measured temperatures were obtained on a fully automated test bench under stable conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the deviations between individual results, highlighting their impact on overall optimization accuracy. Moreover, an improved methodology for thermal analysis is suggested, enabling real-time, sensor-less temperature predictions.},

Transitioning to the reference trajectory layer, we put forth an improved DP strategy. This strategy is forged through the integration of the jump node DP algorithm and the joint interpolation method, permitting the generation of a crafted reference trajectory. In the alternate trajectory layer, segments of the trajectory characterized by substantial curvature, as planned by the improved DP strategy, undergo initial replanning through the adaptive cruise control (ACC) strategy. Subsequently, these trajectory segments revert to the improved DP strategy after traversing specific waypoints within the receding horizon. Simulation cases illustrate that the minimum radius of curvature in the planned trajectory can be augmented by up to 12.7%.

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) offer high torque density. However, they are expensive owing to the rising prices of rare earth elements used in permanent magnets (PMs). This study proposes a double-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (DF-IPMSM) that achieves equivalent output torque and reduced torque ripple, while minimizing PM usage. It achieves flux concentration using C-type ferrite PMs arranged in a flared configuration and enhances reluctance torque by increasing the difference between Ld and Lq using a double-layer PM arrangement. Finite element analysis (FEA) under rated load and drive conditions demonstrates that the DF-IPMSM achieves output torque and efficiency equivalent to those of a single-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (SF-IPMSM) despite the reduced PM usage. To verify the structural advantages of the DF-IPMSM, it was compared with three alternatives, namely, SF-IPMSM, double-bar type IPMSM (DB-IPMSM), and double-spoke type IPMSM (DS-IPMSM), under rated load conditions. The FEA results indicated that the DF-IPMSM achieves the highest reluctance torque at equivalent output torque and efficiency. Although DF-IPMSM utilizes the reluctance torque more effectively than SF-IPMSM, it has the disadvantage of increasing torque ripple due to magnetic saturation and harmonic distortion. We performed an optimization rotor geometry design to improve this drawback. Sample points were generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and constructed a Kriging-based surrogate model. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal values for minimizing torque ripple. Finally, the FEA results of the optimized model were compared with the prototype measurements to verify the validity of the proposed DF-IPMSM. The proposed DF-IPMSM design offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional IPMSMs by significantly reducing reliance on rare earth PMs while maintaining high torque performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics aims to verify the authenticity of an image by determining its origin and any processing it has undergone. Among passive approaches in copy move forgery detection, which analyze images without requiring prior embedded information, a region of interest in an image is duplicated and manipulated to conceal or alter content. This process often involves multiple transformations that significantly alter the image. These transformations consist of several operations such as geometrical transformations, frequency domain transformations, noise addition, etc. In copy-move forgery detection, conventional approaches are generally effective at identifying simple copy-move forgeries. However, these approaches often fall short in detecting copy-move forgeries when frequency domain transformations are applied to the copied regions. Further, existing approaches have a high false positive rate in terms of detecting natural similarity. The proposed method introduces an advanced deep learning approach for detecting copy-move forgeries in frequency domains. During preprocessing, segmentation is utilized to extract the objects or regions of interest in the image. DenseNet121 is employed to extract high-level feature from these segmented regions with a detailed analysis of features from each block. By comparing the features extracted from block 4, the method identifies and maps regions with similar features, thereby detecting potential transformed copy move manipulations. This proposed method demonstrates robustness in identifying forgeries that involve transformations and significantly enhances detection accuracy with natural similarity.},

We classify the algorithms into value-based approaches (such as VDN and QMIX), policy-based approaches (such as Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)), as well as hybrid approaches that support explicit communication (such as CommNet, DIAL, and ROMA). We also review various relevant simulation environments, such as PettingZoo, UWSim, and Gazebo, as well as underwater acoustic channel modeling and key performance metrics used to evaluate the systems. As a complement to the survey study, we present experimental studies on data collection and energy efficiency scenarios using MADDPG and MAPPO. The results include comparative analysis of average reward, overflow, Flight eXceedance (FX), and energy consumption, along with real-time AUV trajectory visualization through a Matplotlib interface. Finally, we propose future research directions, including the integration of Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), graph-based role allocation, and training based on 3D physics simulators, to accelerate the adoption of MARL in large-scale autonomous ocean systems. This survey is expected to serve as a strategic reference for the development of smarter, more collaborative, and resilient AUVs to withstand extreme conditions in support of future smart ocean initiatives.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen energy is recognized as a prominent option of environmental sustainability, particularly through its production via electrolysis units, which makes it an essential part of the worldwide effort to reduce carbon footprints and confront climate change. The clean energy potential of hydrogen positions it at the forefront of these efforts by utilizing power-to-gas (P2G) technology. Nevertheless, the optimum functioning of multi-hub energy (MHE) systems relies on the complex interaction between different energy carriers and the increasing use of tri-generation (TG) technologies. Within this context, this research study offers a novel configuration of combined cooling, heat, and power systems (CCHPS) with highly penetrated renewable resources in the presence of hydrogen vehicles and storage units. In particular, multi-carrier markets under various uncertainties are considered which are modeled using stochastic programming methods. The main goal of this work is to develop an effective structure of multi-hub energy systems and underscore the potential of integrating hydrogen and renewable resources in achieving sustainable energy goals. The present study employs a multi-objective optimization approach (MOA) to assess the system's operation in the context of a techno-environmental perspective. Furthermore, P2G technology has been adopted into the system to augment overall performance, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and supply the cooling and heating demands under various uncertainties. The MOA emphasizes the main aim of decreasing operating costs, with the secondary target being the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The effectiveness of the MOA using the epsilon-constrained technique and Pareto solutions is examined, showing a 32.17% reduction in operating costs and a notable 79.21% reduction in CO₂ emissions through the integration of Power-to-Gas (P2G) technology and the Demand Response Program (DRP).},

  abstract     = {The growth of network technologies has led to a rise in network traffic diversity, which has resulted in increased complexity within each class. However, distinguishing between malicious and benign actions has become more challenging as the two have started to overlap. Consequently, false alarms have become a common issue, which can cause problems in detection models. We proposed a novel approach to enhance intrusion detection based on supervised contrastive learning that combines a maximum-margin-based approach for malware detection in an end-to-end process. This approach differs from traditional methods, where feature selection and detection are considered separate stages. Our model guarantees robustness and correlation between these two processes. To handle the challenges posed by Variation within a class and similarities between different classes, we use the margin-based supervised contrastive learning (MbSCL) technique. This technique involves a two-stage learning process that enables the network to learn embeddings that bring closer the similar data points and separate dissimilar ones. We employ a specialized loss function that combines supervised contrastive loss and marginal loss to improve the accuracy of the classification. This process balances the effectiveness of embedding separation and classification to improve overall performance. Mathematical theorems and proofs support the optimization process, which provides insights into contrastive loss in similarity learning. This two-stage learning approach and loss function design are particularly useful for malware detection, as they enable the identification of subtle data patterns and anomalies in network traffic.},

  abstract     = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) typically relies on strongly labeled data that specify when, where, and which sounds occur, resulting in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we present a framework that enables SELD training without spatial labels, termed spatial annotation-free SELD. The core idea is to reinterpret source localization—traditionally handled as a regression problem—as a classification task called spatial instance classification (SIC). SIC first partitions the observation region into sub-regions. For each sub-region, the acoustic signal capturing its sound events is extracted as a spatial instance. Classifying these instances reveals the sub-regions that contain sound events, thereby providing SELD functionality. By solving SIC under weak supervision, we realize spatial annotation-free SELD. SIC does not depend on a specific microphone configuration, and it is expected to be generally applicable as long as the sound in each divided region can be extracted as an instance. We validate the generality of SIC through two contrasting experiments: (i) application to SELD using first-order ambisonics (FOA), and (ii) application to a newly introduced distributed SELD task, where events are localized on a 2D plane using widely spaced microphones. In both settings, SIC effectively trains SELD systems capable of localizing sound events without spatial annotations. The proposed approach, therefore, facilitates the development of practical, spatial-annotation-free SELD across diverse microphone setups.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave imaging is a promising technique for non-destructive testing (NDT). It is a contactless sensing modality, it can penetrate many optically opaque materials, and millimeter-waves are not harmful to the operator. To enable automated defect recognition in millimeter-wave images, artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning, has been investigated in the research community. One problem associated with deep learning, however, is that the network’s decisions are not based on analytical criteria, but on a non-linear optimization process during training. Because of this, the bases for the network’s predictions are not transparent. This “black box” behavior limits confidence, which restricts the use of deep learning in NDT so far. To make deep learning networks more transparent, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been introduced in the machine learning community. In this study, we introduce explainable AI to millimeter-wave based defect detection. It enables an understanding of how the deep-learning network classifies defects. At the same time, shortcomings of the deep learning network can be made visible. Since explainable AI provides visual maps of important image regions, it is possible to perform a basic defect localization without the need for a specific localization network. This approach is termed “weakly supervised object localization”. In this paper we discuss both defect classification and defect localization based on XAI techniques. Experimental demonstration is performed by means of a millimeter-wave imaging dataset of PVC objects with artificial defects.},

Experimental evaluations show that our H-DCNN-LSTM consistently surpasses standalone LSTM and non-dilated hybrid CNN-LSTM models’ prediction accuracy while mitigating overfitting issues. Moreover, the autocorrelation-informed dilation rates provide an interpretable way to target specific textual patterns, illustrating the benefit of aligning model architectures with inherent data properties.

However, concerns remain about its fairness and inclusivity. In THE WUR, “Research Quality” is a 30% composite metric based entirely on four citation-derived indicators—Citation Impact, Research Strength, Research Excellence, and Research Influence. This study investigates 1,628 institutions from 97 countries included in THE WUR 2025, categorized into six global regions: Anglophone, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The study examines how institutional and regional factors influence citation-based research performance, highlighting disparities across six world regions. Using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple regression models with regional indicators (regional dummy variables) and interaction effects, and residual analysis, we analyze how these institutional and regional factors shape differences in citation-based performance. The results reveal that Anglophone and European universities significantly outperform others in Research Quality, even after adjusting for Research Environment, Teaching (as defined in the THE WUR Teaching metric), and International Outlook. Notably, international collaboration shows a strong positive association with citation impact, particularly for Latin American institutions. In contrast, a negative correlation between Teaching and Research Quality highlights potential trade-offs in institutional strategy. The analysis also highlights persistent structural disadvantages for non-Western regions stemming from linguistic barriers, limited publishing access, and underrepresentation in global citation networks. These results underscore the need for more inclusive and regionally sensitive evaluation frameworks. Policy implications include enhancing international research networks, supporting open access publishing, and expanding recognition of locally relevant scholarship to reduce structural inequities in global rankings.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of coffee leaf diseases is essential for early intervention and improved crop yield. However, training deep learning models for this task often requires large labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative active learning framework with diverse expansion sampling for coffee leaf disease classification, aimed at the need to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high classification accuracy in agricultural disease detection. Our method iteratively selects the most informative and representative samples for labeling, reducing annotation costs while maintaining high classification performance. Diverse expansion sampling leverages a per-class diversity-based selection method inspired by Greedy Furthest-Point Selection, to effectively capture the data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy with fewer labeled samples compared to traditional supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated on two coffee leaf disease datasets from different countries across various data scenarios. The results indicate that our active learning strategy achieves an improvement of 1.4% and 0.9% in F1 score on VIECOLD and BRACOL, respectively, using the same amount of labeled data as in the supervised approach. The results also show that using only 35% of labeled data for VIECOLD and 50% for BRACOL surpasses the performance achieved with the full dataset when applied to the same baseline model. This emphasizes the advantages of selective data utilization for enhanced generalization and efficiency. This research highlights the potential of active learning in optimizing data annotation for agricultural applications, making deep learning-based plant disease detection more accessible and efficient.},

We analyze critical design considerations—including reward function shaping, exploration strategies, and computational requirements—that influence practical deployment. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate key MFRL algorithms and map their suitability across primary, secondary, and tertiary control levels. By examining recent applications, we highlight that MFRL has reached considerable maturity across all control hierarchies, revealing clear trends: continuous-action methods excel in real-time primary control, distributed schemes enhance scalability in secondary coordination, and multi-agent frameworks enable complex tertiary-level optimization.

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) techniques present solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address class imbalance and data scarcity. The current solutions for class imbalance, either random oversampling or random under-sampling techniques, suffer from several issues. For instance, oversampling leads to overfitting due to replication, whilst under-sampling leads to loss of information due to removals. Meanwhile, traditional DA techniques, including paraphrasing, rule-based, or noising approaches, require strong lexicons. These techniques are also either time-consuming or introduce noise, resulting in incorrect syntactical and semantic contexts. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel DA framework for Arabic news articles to address the prevailing challenges in Arabic Multi-Label Text Classification (AMLTC). The proposed framework consists of three phases: abstractive summarization using the Arabic Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (AraBART) model to introduce new features, data generation with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (AraGPT2) to create diverse and contextual texts, and data balancing using borderline Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve an optimal balance. Each phase was evaluated to ensure the quality of the augmented data. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was conducted to assess the performance of the augmented dataset (augDS) on a multi-label Arabic RTN news dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addressed the class imbalance problem by preserving data integrity and significantly improving Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) performance compared to the non-augDS. Specifically, the F1-score increased from 0.54% on the original dataset to 0.90% after augmentation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully addresses the issues in Arabic datasets by generating diverse, novel augmented data.

Trajectory data, vital for urban planning, mobility analytics or Traffic Management Systems (TMSs), is particularly sensitive to re-identification even when explicit identifiers are removed. This article introduces APU-TrajGen+, a novel method for real-time, privacy-preserving point-to-point trajectory generation. APU-TrajGen+ leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit-based model to synthesize trajectory points, followed by an adaptive perturbation mechanism that dynamically balances privacy and utility. Designed for local execution, APU-TrajGen+ protects location data at the device level, eliminating the need for centralized processing and preventing unprotected data transmission. Unlike many existing methods, APU-TrajGen+ does not rely on map data or points of interest to generate points in plausible locations. A configurable utility-privacy score guides an adaptive process, to allow data owners to set the protection levels to their specific needs. Experimental results show that APU-TrajGen+ produces realistic trajectories while achieving desired privacy and utility objectives. The method is particularly suitable for LBS and TMS scenarios that require continuous, point-to-point data release, supporting both high utility and strong privacy guarantees without compromising real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

  abstract     = {Electric train transportation requires a substantial amount of electrical energy to power trains’ propulsion systems. Consequently, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are considered for installation at traction substations in heavy rail systems to supply this energy. However, nonlinear loads in heavy rail systems cause power quality issues that affect the grid distribution system. To mitigate these issues, an active power filter (APF) is employed to eliminate harmonics and improve the power factor. This paper introduces an APF control strategy for heavy rail systems integrated with installed PV arrays. The proposed harmonic detection method for calculating the APF reference current has been improved to achieve fast computation and more accurate reference current value. In addition, the injection of compensating current by the APF is controlled using a model predictive current control strategy, which incorporates a current injection model through a transformer for high voltage system. The MPC controller effectively compensates for digital delays and minimizes the ripple in the compensating current. Real-time simulations conducted on OPAL RT-LAB hardware was used to verify the performance of the proposed control strategy. The experimental results confirm that the proposed APF control strategy effectively eliminates harmonics and complies with IEEE 519-2022 and MEA standards for power factor correction in heavy rail systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires the ability to rapidly perceive changes and make safe, efficient decisions. While numerous studies have explored learning-based planning methods to address this challenge, diffusion-based planning methods have recently emerged as a promising approach in robotic path planning by modeling action sequences as probabilistic trajectories and capturing diverse planning behaviors under uncertainty. However, they still face significant challenges in generalizing to unseen situations and demand extensive data collection to achieve robust performance. In particular, efforts to ensure general robustness by learning from all possible scenarios can introduce inefficiencies, as many cases may be irrelevant during actual deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner (HADP), designed to achieve robust navigation performance even in unseen dynamic environments. In obstacle-free environments, HADP employs the A* algorithm for global path planning, whereas when a dynamic obstacle is detected within a predefined boundary, it records observations and leverages a conditional diffusion model to generate a local avoidance path. After avoidance, the path is re-planned using A*. To enable the diffusion model to generate effective avoidance paths, a semantic map is constructed by incorporating key environmental information within the predefined boundary. This map, along with the robot’s position and local goal information, serves as a conditional input to the diffusion model. HADP is trained on an expert trajectory dataset created by recording expert-driven navigation across various dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experiments in various simulations in dynamic obstacle environments demonstrated HADP’s superior success rate, trajectory smoothness, and robust generalization performance in unseen environments compared to existing approaches. Real-world tests further confirmed its practical applicability and highlighted its potential as a robust and scalable solution for dynamic obstacle environments, and the simulation code used in this study is publicly available on https://github.com/kMinsAlgorithm/HADP.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates a data-driven decision support system to aid in rectification of prosthetic sockets aimed at improving overall comfort perceived by amputees. Prosthetic technology, particularly in the realm of socket design, plays a pivotal role in rehabilitation for individuals with limb amputations. Prosthetic sockets, which serve as the critical interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb, enable amputees to walk without the need for invasive implants that connect directly to the bone of the residual limb. This study focuses on the role of intra-socket pressure in socket performance and its impact on optimal socket rectifications for improving comfort in transfemoral amputees. Employing thin Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors, the research measures dynamic pressure variations across individual gait cycles. To explore the effects of altered pressure distribution on socket performance, a clinical trial was conducted consisting of four different socket configurations across several participants, one of which was with no pad inserted and three of which incorporated a silicone pad to modify the dynamic pressure profiles. With data from multiple participants including specific dynamic pressure features extracted from FSR sensors, and subjective feedback of comfort, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained to establish predictive relationships between intra-socket pressure and appropriate rectification action. The findings suggest that the MLP agent is more accurate at suggesting rectification actions to prosthetists when compared to simpler classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression, laying the foundation for future advancements in prosthetic design.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the version management challenges faced by metering automation systems in the context of smart grids by proposing a knowledge graph-based method for version difference detection and localization, named I-OVDL (Index-based Optimized Version Difference Location with Incremental Updates). As metering automation systems evolve toward distributed microservice architectures, independently updated subsystems have led to severe version fragmentation. Traditional text-based version control methods exhibit significant limitations in detecting semantic differences and providing real-time responses. The main contributions of this study are threefold: First, we construct a domain-specific ontology for the metering system version knowledge graph and apply the TransE algorithm for embedding representation, enabling the mapping from code changes to business semantics, with a 28.6% improvement in accuracy. Second, we design a weighted difference measurement model across four dimensions—functionality, interface, performance, and dependency—using the entropy weight method to determine the weighting coefficients for each dimension. Third, we introduce an indexing optimization technique based on locality-sensitive hashing, which reduces the complexity of version retrieval from O(n) to sublinear time. Experimental results on a dataset containing 685 real system versions demonstrate that the I-OVDL method achieves a 93.6% difference detection rate (a 30.1% improvement over traditional methods), 92.47% feature coverage, and reduces version localization time from 120 seconds to 6.8 seconds. In a provincial power grid pilot application, the method helped reduce regression test cases by 37%, significantly improving operation and maintenance efficiency.},

A UWSN is made up of acoustic sensors powered by batteries. Replacement of these batteries is complicated because of the complex underwater conditions of UWSNs. One strategy for fixing this issue is to extend the lifetime of UWSNs by decreasing the energy they spend and enhancing their energy usage. This research proposes a set of rules based on Energy-balanced unequal layering clustering (EULC) and PSO (Particle swarm optimization) that enhances the performance of the lifetime of UWSNs. The proposed hybrid PSO-EULC combination produces UWSNs with different layering based entirely on node depth, with Cluster head (CH) nodes chosen using the PSO cost function. The hybrid PSO-EULC combination successfully balances the energy used in UWSN nodes, thus extending sensor node lifetime, packet transmission cost, and network lifetime. The results are compared with Energy Efficient Unequal Multilevel Clustering (EEUMC), Energy-balanced reliable and effective clustering (EBREC) , and LEACH with parameters such as residual energy, dead nodes, and total packets received at different initial power levels of 1J,0.5J for 6400 bits, and 4000 bits of data transmission. As per case 4 the residual energy of 44.4% improved, dead nodes 15% less, and 50.25% of received packets is achieved by comparing it with the EEUMC algorithm.},

A sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model was developed and meticulously fine-tuned to achieve an impressive 99% classification accuracy through cross-validation. To enhance the model’s interpretability, powerful explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods such as LRP, LIME, and attention imaging were implemented to clarify the reasoning behind the model’s outputs. Through cross-validation tests, the model’s trustworthiness and extensive generalizability were assessed. The findings underscore the promising capabilities of employing transformer-based deep learning frameworks along with multimodal acoustic features and explanatory methods to improve cry analysis in infants and their usable scopes in pediatric medicine.},

  abstract     = {Brain age estimation has emerged as a crucial biomarker for quantifying inter-individual variability in brain aging and identifying risks of cognitive decline. This is particularly relevant for the study of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, where deviations from normal brain aging patterns can serve as early indicators of pathology. We introduce an interpretable framework for brain age estimation that adopts a multi-region perspective to capture heterogeneous neuroanatomical changes. Groupwise registration was employed to construct sex- and age-stratified templates, enabling the computation of anatomically meaningful displacement vector fields (DVFs) that characterize voxel-wise structural deviations from the population average. From these DVFs, features were extracted in fifteen brain regions using a 3D shape context descriptor to encode displacement direction and magnitude. Validation was performed on 1,956 T1-weighted MRI scans from cognitively normal individuals in the ADNI dataset (ages 60–90). The combined multi-region model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.66 ± 0.15 years (R2 = 0.84 ± 0.05) for males and 1.81 ± 0.12 years (R2 = 0.80 ± 0.04) for females, significantly outperforming many contemporary deep learning models. These findings demonstrate that biologically interpretable, registration-derived features—when analyzed from a multi-regional perspective—can yield robust and accurate estimates of brain age. Beyond predictive accuracy, the framework provides insights into the regional specificity of aging processes, thereby offering a foundation for early detection strategies and targeted clinical applications in neurodegenerative disease research.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an automatic bandwidth boost method for the current control loop in servo motor drives, specifically targeting the adverse effects of time delay. In digital control systems, time delays caused by PWM updates, computation latency, and current sensing significantly degrade the bandwidth and stability of current regulation. To address this issue, three main contributions are presented. First, the impact of observer-based current prediction on the effective control loop delay is thoroughly analyzed, showing that it reduces control latency and increases phase margin. Second, an FFT-based estimation method is proposed to estimate the compensated time delay by measuring the phase shift between the sensed and observer currents. Third, an autotuning method based on the Magnitude Optimum criterion is developed to automatically adjust controller gains using the estimated delay, thereby maximizing the control bandwidth while maintaining sufficient stability margin. Simulation and experimental validation on a 400 W servo motor drive demonstrate that the proposed method improves the –90° bandwidth from 1.48 to 2.17 kHz and from 4.67 to 6.71 kHz at 10 kHz and 30 kHz PWM frequencies, respectively. Phase margins remain above 69°, and dynamic stiffness increases from 8.4 to 14 dB and from 15.9 to 20.7 dB. Robustness is confirmed under motor parameter variations, where the proposed method maintains stable operation and outperforms the original controller design without gain retuning. These results fully support the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for servo motor drives.},

This study presents the first reinforcement learning-driven framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm that enables multi-objective optimization with tunable trade-offs among dynamic power, static power, delay, and area. We implemented an automated Python-LTspice closed-loop system, allowing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained at a 50 nm node to iteratively optimize transistor configurations for an eight-transistor static random-access memory (8T-SRAM) cell. Experimental results at the training node demonstrate reductions of up to 65% in dynamic power, 73% in static power, 39% in propagation delay, and 21% in silicon area, depending on weight settings. Additional evaluations across the 22 nm and 90 nm nodes indicate that the trained model generalizes effectively, maintaining robust optimization performance at different scales. The model significantly improves the exploration efficiency and flexibility of the optimization process compared with traditional static weighting methods, resulting in superior multi-objective balancing capabilities.},

In the proposed methodology, the inrush conditions and CT saturation condition are detected using the waveform distortion estimation and current polarity index technique by utilizing the current signal parameters. The power system is simulated in PSCAD software to create various fault conditions in the transformer. Different transformer internal and external faults have been generated considering mild to heavy CT saturation phenomenon. The proposed dynamic differential relaying method is implemented in MATLAB software for CT saturation detection and transformer fault zone identification. A hardware prototype has been developed to simulate practical inrush and fault scenarios on a transformer to validate the proposed relaying technique. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the microcontroller, which efficiently detects the occurrence of different levels of CT saturation and successfully operates for all internal faults.

  abstract     = {Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.},

Positive polarity treatments, particularly at +30 kV for 90 seconds, significantly enhanced the levels of key bioactive compounds, including wedelolactone (6.751 ± 0.004 mg/g), total phenolic content (73.229 ± 0.874 mg GAE/g), and total flavonoid content (120.388 ± 1.472 mg QE/g). DPPH antioxidant activity assay, measured through IC₅₀ values, showed remarkable improvement, with the lowest IC₅₀ recorded at 2.755 ± 0.004 μg/mL. Positive polarity also optimized germination rates (up to 77%) and promoted plant growth with enhanced root and straw lengths. Plasma-treated extracts demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects against Aβ42 and MPP+-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, correlating with elevated wedelolactone, phenolic acid and flavonoid levels. The findings reveal the potential of plasma technology as a non-thermal, eco-friendly method to enhance the bioactive properties and therapeutic applications of E. prostrata.

  abstract     = {Accurate drive mode classification is essential for enhancing the reliability and predictive maintenance of heavy-duty electric trucks. This study proposes a novel fuzzy logic-based framework, DriveSense, for real-time drive mode classification, addressing key challenges such as sensor noise, transitional behaviors, and computational efficiency. The proposed approach integrates a two-stage filtering pipeline, combining adaptive outlier removal and a dynamic Kalman filter to enhance data quality. A fuzzy inference system with smoothened trapezoidal membership functions is then applied to classify driving modes into standstill, constant speed, acceleration, and deceleration while mitigating the effects of noise and edge cases. Performance evaluation using real-world and simulated drive cycles demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 97.8%), F1-score (up to 0.97), and robustness against noise, while reducing false positives. Comparative analysis against baseline models, demonstrates DriveSense’s superior accuracy and generalizability across diverse driving patterns. The framework’s lightweight and interpretable fuzzy inference engine operates with low computational latency, ensuring compatibility with real-time embedded systems typical of heavy-duty electric trucks. Moreover, DriveSense models transitional behaviors through overlapping fuzzy sets and adaptive borderline classification logic, enabling smooth identification of subtle shifts such as rolling stops or gradual deceleration. These results highlight DriveSense’s potential to enhance predictive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and support scalable, fleet-wide diagnostics.},

The phased array antenna integrates a 1 : 24Wilkinson power divider, 24 elements of a modified antipodal Vivaldi antenna, and T/R modules onto a multi-layer PCB, achieving a compact size of 23.5 × 9 cm² and enhanced portability, making it suitable for space-constrained platforms such as drones, vehicles, and satellite terminals. The array offers a high gain of 21.82 dBi and a wide bandwidth covering the entire 18–20 GHz band. Furthermore, it supports beam steering from −40° to +40° while maintaining low sidelobe levels and minimal gain degradation during beamforming. An orthogonal coding-based calibration method is implemented to mitigate performance degradation due to mismatched line impedance and fabrication errors. By applying a set of orthogonal codes through onboard phase control circuitry, phase errors of each element are simultaneously measured. Furthermore, a new approach for assessing calibration error is introduced, which uses RMS amplitude and phase error metrics to evaluate post-calibration performance. This information can subsequently be used to correct residual amplitude and phase errors in the calibrated data. The paper covers the design specifications, theoretical framework, and measured results of the phased array antenna, including the calibration technique, its performance assessment, and several key findings from the experiments conducted in this work.},

To better address key issues in multimodal feature alignment, such as channel misalignment, scale mismatch, and insufficient robustness to large-sized images, we propose a novel Collaborative Perception Fusion Network (CP-FN). The network employs a dual-stream architecture design, using a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to extract deep hierarchical multi-scale feature representations from the base stream. Combined with dilated convolution technology to effectively expand the receptive field, the extracted multi-scale information is gradually integrated into the detailed information stream to achieve feature compensation. The collaborative perception of multi-scale features progresses layer-by-layer from coarse-grained to fine-grained, promoting more comprehensive feature representation and effective cross-modal information alignment. Subsequently, we design an innovative dynamic weight allocation fusion strategy, which adaptively adjusts the weight coefficients of each modality according to the statistical characteristics of features to ensure balanced fusion of multimodal information. Additionally, through deep optimization of the self-attention mechanism, the network’s robustness and stability in processing large-sized images are significantly improved. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets show that the CP-FN significantly outperforms existing comparative methods, particularly in feature alignment accuracy and fusion quality.},

  abstract     = {Agricultural price volatility poses significant challenges for food security, market regulation, and rural economic stability. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated early warning model that combines the representational capabilities of deep learning with the interpretability of symbolic knowledge. The framework features two primary components: AgroFormer, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed to capture hierarchical spatio-temporal dependencies across crops, regions, environmental factors, and time; and AgroScope, a strategic reasoning module that converts predictive insights into operational decisions through knowledge-aware constraints and risk-sensitive optimization. The model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets—Agmarknet, AGRIS, WorldCereal, and GAEZ—spanning structured tabular records, multilingual textual documents, and high-resolution remote sensing data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance across all datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with an average improvement of 12.3% in prediction accuracy and a 12.1% reduction in RMSE. Ablation studies further validate the unique contributions of symbolic attribute alignment, differentiable scheduling graphs, and knowledge-aware constraints. Beyond technical contributions, the proposed system offers tangible value to agricultural practitioners. It enables proactive decision-making by delivering early warnings for price fluctuations, optimizing crop rotation schedules under policy and environmental constraints, and supporting adaptive planning in response to real-time market signals. The framework’s modular design facilitates deployment in diverse agro-ecological contexts, making it suitable for applications ranging from farm-level management to national food security planning. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with domain knowledge to create interpretable, scalable, and actionable tools for intelligent agricultural risk management.},

  abstract     = {Event-based cameras provide many advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, both in terms of time resolution and motion blur, making them increasingly popular in research and industrial applications, particularly in automotive sensing. However, despite the recent uptake, event-based datasets are still rare. This lack of availability of time-event datasets has led to the development of tools such as v2e [1], which can simulate event streams from conventional video. Although these tools are incredibly useful for early stage development and testing, little attention has been paid to how the quality of the source video affects these simulated events. This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the impact of video compression on simulated event streams. We evaluate how lossy compression algorithms affect the accuracy and noise levels of simulated events, revealing that compression artifacts, particularly in darker regions of videos, can produce significant noise in these event streams.We introduce a novel event stream comparison method to determine the fidelity of events simulated from varying video codecs and parameters. Our findings show that compression can severely degrade simulated event quality, and that codec choice and parameters can influence event fidelity significantly. We further benchmark a range of corrective methods, including conventional filters and machine learning-based preprocessing, to mitigate the adverse effects of compression. Although some approaches show some improvements, none fully restore the fidelity of uncompressed video sources. We conclude with practical recommendations for dataset publishers and researchers using event simulation tools, emphasizing the importance of compression-aware practices in dataset preparation and usage.},

However, with the rapid increase in the number of smart terminal devices, authentication generates a large amount of identity information, leading to storage and transmission problems, including large data transmission delays and strained computational capabilities at some nodes. Through the design of lightweight multi-factor authentication method and the terminal side migration of computing resources, this paper proposes a multi-factor authentication method for grid terminal based on the idea of edge computing. It is based on the target recognition technology of the YOLO algorithm and takes the target ’category’ and the target’attitude’ in the detection box as ’ownership-based’ and ’knowledge-based’ authentication factors. Finally, the authentication security and the real-time performance of the mechanism are verified through experiments. Experimental results show that the method achieves 96.3% interception of predefined identity attacks (e.g., brute force, impersonation) and 5.1 times faster authentication compared to traditional multi-factor mechanisms with the same level of security. The method achieves an average authentication delay of 3.63 seconds, balancing real-time performance and security.},

This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

To achieve the full potential of multiple antennas, it is of paramount importance to accurately express the relationship between the received signal envelope and the underlying 3-D spatio-temporal configuration of the channel. We propose an improved 3-D spatio-temporal configuration of V2V radio propagation channels and then provide detailed analytical insights into the fading characteristics of the received signal envelope. Although, first-order statistics describe the distribution of received signal amplitudes but do not capture their variation over time. In contrast, second-order statistics such as level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) show how fades occur and persist over time. In this context, we analyze the impact of different system and channel parameters (such as mobility condition and composition of scattering region) on the second-order fading statistics of the received signal envelope by exploiting the theory of 3-D multipath shape factors. Further, we investigate the impact of notable physical and geometric channel parameters on angular, temporal, and envelop fading statistics. Finally, we validate the expressions derived by comparing the Monte Carlo simulation results with empirical datasets available in the literature and demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our proposed model.},

In understaffed nursing homes, timely toileting support is often lacking, making reliable monitoring of voiding intention essential for reducing dependence and improving the quality of life. This study explores the feasibility of using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify urinary urgency and voiding intentions. Ten participants were recruited, and EEG signals were recorded with a 64-channel EEG device during both non-urgent and urgent states. The SEResNet34 deep learning model, which incorporates ResNet34 and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) components with temporal aggregated pooling (TAP), was proposed, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test set. The result showed that the improved SEResNet34 model can effectively classify EEG signals for urgency, achieving an accuracy of 0.9208, a precision of 0.9130, a recall of 0.9292, and an F1-score of 0.9211. The model outperformed ResNet18; however, the additional increase in layers beyond ResNet34 was not significantly beneficial. The ablation study showed that integrating the SE mechanism and the TAP function into the ResNet architecture can improve its accuracy. The proposed model surpasses the other models, indicating that it is better suited for the task of urgency detection. EEG shows significant potential in predicting urinary urgency and voiding intention, offering a new direction for the development of non-invasive monitoring and intelligent rehabilitation devices, with the potential to drive technological advancement in related fields.},

A systematic search was performed across Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed using a structured query covering cybersecurity threats and countermeasures in perception-layer medical devices. Only peer-reviewed English articles were included. Screening and eligibility assessment followed PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham’s methodology, excluding studies unrelated to perception-layer cybersecurity or lacking countermeasure discussion. A structured framework was developed to classify devices, attack types, and defensive strategies. Twenty-one studies were included, revealing a research focus on wearable devices and monitoring functionalities, while portable and implantable systems with actuation capabilities remain underexplored. Most documented attacks involve replay, DoS, eavesdropping, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks, whereas advanced threats like side-channel attacks are rarely addressed. Defensive strategies mainly rely on authentication schemes and transmission-level cryptography, while recovery capabilities are inadequately addressed. Research on perception-layer cybersecurity in electromedical devices is still fragmented, with uneven protection of critical security properties. Future work should expand to implantable and actuation-enabled devices, develop multi-layer defenses addressing all security objectives, and introduce resilience mechanisms to support robust cybersecurity in decentralized healthcare environments.},

  abstract     = {To address the logistics problems faced by high-end equipment manufacturers in their two-stage supply chain, this study proposes an optimization strategy for material distribution intervals and quantities. The strategy is based on an improved Mayfly algorithm. These problems include difficulties in accurately responding to production demands, high logistics distribution costs, and low material quality. We have established a two-stage collaborative optimization model of material distribution. This model is adapted to production takt time and its intelligent algorithm. Firstly, we construct a two-stage material distribution interval and quantity optimization model. This model incorporates the total logistics cost of the two-stage supply chain as the optimization objective. It uses Just-in-time delivery and delivery time as constraints. It also considers the complexity of multi-supplier proportional supply. The model is built from multi-supplier to the manufacturer’s warehouse and from the manufacturer’s warehouse to the assembly line side, taking into account material quality. Then, based on this model, we propose an improved Mayfly algorithm. This improved algorithm integrates chaotic maps and adaptive inertia weight. These enhancements aim to improve the optimization ability and convergence speed of the Mayfly algorithm. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm. We conduct an example application under different production takt times. The results demonstrate that the developed model and algorithm have competitive performance in addressing the studied problems, achieving significant reductions in material distribution costs.},

  abstract     = {Immersive mixed reality in industrial applications requires low latencies; however, systems are commonly limited by the large amounts of generated data and the subsequent high traffic loads on the 5G network. Semantic or goal-oriented compression has emerged as a solution to this problem. In this study, we combine the generated data from several cameras at the network edge through multilevel semantic coding, which we refer to as MLcXR+. We define the overall MLcXR+ approach, including computation load placements on Edge Application Servers (EASs), and demonstrate feasibility in a 5G system with an open-source prototype on commodity hardware. We develop and evaluate two MLcXR+ modes: independent MLcXR+ (iMLcXR+), where the EASs operate independently, and dependent MLcXR+ (dMLcXR+), where the EASs form a chain of successive compression levels. From our evaluations with a reproducible dataset and our open-source prototype, we find that compared to prior state-of-the-art, our MLcXR+ approach can achieve a 3.5 times higher compression ratio factor, substantially reducing the data amounts sent over the 5G Data Network (DN) and processed at the Head-Mounted Display (HMD). We also find that iMLcXR+ at a single EAS, or dMLcXR+ with one or an appropriately configured higher number of EASs achieve the highest compression. Load balancing of the MLcXR+ computations over multiple EASs substantially reduces the iMLcXR+ compression performance, and can slightly increase the network transport delays of dMLcXR+ due to the compression chain. However, even load-balanced dMLcXR+ still incurs slightly less total computation (compression) and network transport delays than prior approaches, mainly due to the reduced HMD processing.},

  abstract     = {Precise measurement of high-steepness optical components is a critical challenge currently faced, which is being overcome through a groundbreaking high-steepness mirror sub-aperture stitching interferometric measurement method utilizing the instrument transfer function (ITF). A spherical step test plate was meticulously designed and manufactured based on ITF calibration principles. This essential tool enables the calibration of the ITF distribution at different spatial positions of the sub-aperture stitching instrument during the measurement of steep spherical mirrors. A comprehensive analysis then revealed a clear ITF distribution pattern, which made it possible to develop a data fusion algorithm model for the overlapping regions in the sub-aperture stitching process. In practical application, a highly successful stitching measurement was performed on a high-steepness spherical mirror with a diameter of 100 mm and a curvature radius of 103.314 mm. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in optical surface metrology. The full-aperture stitching achieved a peak-to-valley (PV) residual error of 0.073λ in the central region, with a root mean square (RMS) error of 0.002λ. Similarly, the edge region exhibited a PV error of 0.039λ and an RMS error of 0.002λ. These values represent a marked enhancement over conventional averaging-based fusion algorithms. These excellent results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this study and provide a clear solution for high-precision measurement of steep optical components. This innovative method advances the field and sets a new benchmark for the precise measurement of optical component facets.},

While many existing methods embed secret data by modifying image parameters in the spatial or frequency domains, they often overlook local pixel characteristics and the potential of the alpha channel for data embedding. This paper proposes a flexible Least Significant Bit (LSB) information hiding framework that adaptively adjusts the number of embedded bits based on pixel intensity ranges. By configuring the embedding function, the framework can support multiple strategies: (i) allocating more bits to low-intensity regions and fewer to high-intensity ones, (ii) leveraging Weber’s Just Noticeable Difference (JND) principle to embed more data in high-intensity pixels, and (iii) combining both approaches to embed more in low- and high-intensity regions while reducing payload in mid-intensity regions. Additionally, the alpha channel is exploited to further enhance embedding capacity while preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed adaptive framework significantly outperforms existing methods in embedding capacity, while maintaining high visual quality with PSNR values consistently above practical thresholds.},

We propose the SALSK module. It improves the detection precision for objects of varying sizes. Furthermore, we redesign the core module C3k2 in YOLOv11 by incorporating a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism, which can aid in better distinguishing between defects and background noise and reduces the impact of complex backgrounds. Additionally, we propose the ASSPPF module. The module integrates detailed information across various scales, strengthening the detection capability for small objects. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model across two distinct datasets. The model achieves mAP@0.5 values of 95.5% and 99.2%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 values of 84.3% and 84.4%, respectively. Compared to the baseline model, mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 2.5% and 2.0%, validating the robust generalization and resilience of the model.

  abstract     = {Native advertisements are increasingly common as hybrid commercial content embedded within digital news platforms. Although these ads can enhance user engagement, they often elicit negative reactions due to their concealed commercial intent. A key challenge in detecting native advertisements lies in their lack of explicit labeling, which can mislead readers and compromise the perceived credibility of news content. Prior studies have struggled to accurately identify native ads because of their inability to capture the implicit characteristics embedded in editorial-like text, such as positive sentiment, persuasive language, one-sided perspectives, and references to specific products or companies. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning architecture called SENADA (Stacked Ensemble for Native Advertising Analysis). The model integrates BERT-based contextual representations, ensemble learning strategies, and a BiLSTM with an attention mechanism. This design enables the model to effectively identify subtle patterns and contextual cues associated with native advertisements. In addition, we introduce a newly constructed Indonesian-language dataset of news articles, annotated based on the four implicit characteristics of native ads. The dataset was collected from six major e-news portals and manually labeled by trained annotators. Experimental evaluations, based on confusion matrix analysis, demonstrate that SENADA achieves an accuracy of 0.93, along with high values for precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed model consistently outperforms baseline approaches, particularly in minimizing misclassification of borderline content. These results confirm the model’s effectiveness in detecting native advertisements that exhibit complex and implicit textual patterns. While the model shows promising results, future work is needed to reduce architectural complexity and training time. Further research could explore explainability methods and cross-lingual adaptation to extend the model’s applicability across languages and media contexts.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Neural Network Coding Layer (NNCL) that applies network coding theory to provide structured redundancy and enable reconstruction of lost features, thereby mitigating information loss problems in deep learning models. Unlike existing skip connections or attention mechanisms, NNCL embeds reconstructible redundancy into intermediate features through a learnable coding process, providing an explicit algebraic restoration mechanism for the original features. This design adapts the core principle of network coding—encoding information recoverably across a channel—for application within the computational graph of a neural network. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets validate NNCL’s effectiveness. Even under a more conventional feature erasure rate of 20%, NNCL consistently improved classification accuracy by up to 8.3 percentage points. The model’s robustness becomes even more pronounced under extreme conditions. In a deliberate stress test involving 60% feature erasure—a scenario where baseline model performance collapses—NNCL dramatically boosted accuracy by up to 40.3 percentage points (e.g., from 19.8% to 60.1% on CIFAR-100). The proposed layer is designed to be modular and has been successfully integrated into various modern architectures, including ResNet and EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer, proving its broad applicability.},

The literature review identified core components of effective BDG roles and responsibilities, activities and processes, which informed the development of the study instruments. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with ICT and MIS directors and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, while quantitative data were collected from 119 operational staff and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings from both data sources revealed fragmented BDG practices, low levels of tool deployment and integration, and inconsistencies in role definition and assignment, policy implementation, and institutional coordination. While institutions in Malaysia demonstrated relatively more mature and established BDG programs; responses from Nigerian institutions reflected early-stage development or complete absence of data governance structures. Notably, a large proportion of institutions lacks awareness or access to technical platforms necessary for effective BDG practices. The study highlights the need for tools and technologies, and the integration of BDG responsibilities across all institutional levels. This research contributes new empirical evidence on the challenges and disparities in BDG implementation. It offers actionable recommendations and proposes future research directions focused on BDG maturity models, multi-regional assessments, and the role of emerging technologies in strengthening big data governance frameworks in higher education.},

This paper considers a green contract farming supply chain (GCFSC) consisting of a company and a farmer, and compares the effectiveness of two green subsidy policies on the GCFSC. We find that both green subsidy policy are an effective way to improve the economic, environmental, and social benefits of the GCFSC. However, the performance of these two subsidy policies varies depending on the government’s total subsidy expenditure. In general, the green production quantity subsidy policy is more beneficial to farmers and consumers, while the green investment cost subsidy policy is more beneficial to companies and the environment. Notably, when the subsidy coefficient is high, subsidizing the company based on green investment costs can maximize returns in terms of environmental benefits and total social welfare. Furthermore, we examined the impact of a company’s altruistic preference on GCFSC decision-making and benefits under the green investment cost subsidies. The results show that although the company’s altruistic preference contributes to the overall social welfare of the GCFSC, it reduces the company’s profits. Moreover, the company’s profit losses increase as the company’s altruistic preference or the government’s subsidy coefficient increases. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to optimize green subsidy policies, and for GCFSC members to enhance decision-making and cooperation mechanisms, thereby improving the economic and environmental performance of GCFSCs.},

To address this issue, a wavelet-guided hybrid attention intelligent framework for microseismic event recognition is proposed. Initially, a wavelet domain attention-guided filtering module is designed, which maps time-domain signals to the wavelet domain and employs an attention mechanism to filter and extract features from the signals, thereby enhancing noise suppression and robustness. Subsequently, a physical-knowledge-guided loss function composed of Hilbert transform and l2 / l4 norm is designed to optimize the neural network model. Finally, experimental validation is conducted on a dataset of microseismic events from highway slopes. The experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed method reached 96.31%, outperforming comparative methods and demonstrating the potential application of the proposed method in practical engineering.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the evolving landscape of smart grids and super smart grids (SSG) through a review of recent academic publications (2019-2024). An SSG expands the traditional smart grid concept by interconnecting power grids across vast regions, facilitating the efficient transfer of renewable energy sources (RES) across borders. While the potential of SSG lies in enhancing global energy security and reducing carbon emissions, significant challenges remain, including high infrastructure costs, geopolitical risks and cybersecurity concerns. Additionally, controversies surrounding energy control and the environmental impact of large-scale infrastructure development add complexity to the SSG debate. Our paper focuses on emerging research trends and key topics related to SSG, aiming to address several concerns: (1) SSG viability given the current global energy landscape and conflicts; (2) the prevailing academic sentiment towards SSG in recent publications; (3) the most prominent research topics and emergent themes in the field. By analyzing recent publications from the past five years, we aim to shed light on the future of SSG and their interactions with local energy systems such as microgrids.

  abstract     = {The Histogram of Oriented Gradients algorithm is a widely adopted technique in visual feature extraction, especially in object detection tasks. Traditionally, HOG descriptors rely on fixed-size cells and blocks to capture local gradient distributions. Although this technique has been proven effective in pedestrian detection, its single-scale structure limits its ability to represent features in changing spatial patterns. To address this limitation, this study introduces an improved feature extraction method that integrates multi-scale partitioning. Inspired by feature pyramid representation, the method captures image characteristics in different receptive fields by using multiple combinations of cell and block sizes. These features are aggregated to form amore discriminative and robust representation. Comprehensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-scale HOGframework consistently outperforms standard HOGmethods, providing remarkable improvements in both classification and detection accuracy. The results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the method in diverse visual recognition scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The Artificial Potential Field (APF) methodology, first proposed by Khatib, has garnered significant attention as a prevalent technique for the navigation of mobile robots, attributed to its inherent simplicity and capacity for real-time application. This approach directs robots through the utilization of virtual attractive and repulsive forces; however, it is not without significant drawbacks, including the emergence of local minima, particularly the struggle of reaching the goal when confronted by close obstacles. Such challenges can result in the robot becoming ensnared or displaying oscillatory dynamics in proximity to obstacles. This manuscript introduces an amended potential function that mitigates these shortcomings while preserving computational efficiency. The proposed APF incorporates corrective terms that reformulate the potential landscape, thereby effectively abolishing undesirable local minima and guaranteeing convergence towards the goal, even when situated close to obstacles. Two control strategies, namely static and dynamic control laws, are proposed in conjunction with the revised APF, incorporating linear damping to enhance stability. A thorough mathematical analysis is provided, demonstrating the stability and efficacy of the suggested solution. Simulations conducted within complex environments reveal that the new function engenders smooth and successful trajectories, surpassing the original APF methodology in terms of dependability and robustness. The findings underscore the appropriateness of the proposed function for real-time navigation endeavors within dynamic and cluttered settings. This research contributes to the progression of autonomous navigation by improving the reliability of path planning based on potential fields.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction creates digital 3D models from multiple Two-dimensional images and is widely applied in robotics, cultural heritage preservation, industrial inspection, and immersive media. Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction methods by learning rich feature representations. However, challenges remain, including capturing features at multiple scales, handling low-textured or repetitive regions, and balancing accuracy with memory and speed, especially for high-resolution or large scenes. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Transformer-based Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (TF-FPN) for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction. The proposed architecture integrates two main components: (1) a frequency-aware multi-scale fusion module that adaptively combines structural and textural information across different scales, and (2) a coarse-stage feature matching transformer that establishes reliable cross-view correspondences using lightweight self-and cross-attention mechanisms at the lowest resolution. Furthermore, a memory-efficient cascaded multi-view stereo network framework, termed TF-MVSNet, is introduced based on the TF-FPN module. This framework employs variance-based cost aggregation and channel reduction to minimize memory overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that TF-MVSNet frame work achieving superior accuracy in DTU dataset (0.313mm error) and Tanks and Temples (F − score: 60.13%). We further show that replacing the baseline feature extractor with TF-FPN in MVSNeRF improves the rendering quality metrics (PSNR: 25.90 27.50 dB) while lowering memory usage. The lightweight design and efficiency make TF-FPN suitable for real-time or resource-constrained 3D reconstruction tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jjunaid88/TF-MVSNet.git.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models have shown strong generalization across a variety of pathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation and report generation. However, most existing models are trained exclusively on single-scale, high-magnification patches, often overlooking the rich contextual information available at lower magnifications. Applying such models directly to low-resolution inputs can lead to degraded or misleading feature representations, as crucial spatial context may be lost. Moreover, fine-tuning foundation models for each task is both computationally intensive and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Multi-Expert Knowledge Distillation, PatHME, a unified framework that integrates multi-scale information and leverages multiple expert foundation models for more effective and efficient WSI analysis. First, the Prompt-guided Multi-Scale Distillation module bridges the gap between low- and high-resolution representations by distilling features across magnifications using scale-aware prompts, enabling the model to capture both global tissue architecture and fine-grained cellular detail. We further introduce a Multi-Expert Knowledge Distillation strategy that enables feature-level knowledge transfer from a teacher expert to a student expert without retraining, enhancing adaptability while reducing computational cost. Finally, we incorporate a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention mechanism to dynamically fuse multi-resolution features based on tissue context, enabling the model to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global structural patterns. Experimental results on multiple TCGA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance and efficiency, providing a scalable and generalizable solution for advanced digital pathology applications.},

  abstract     = {Earthquake forecasting using traditional methods remains a complex task due to the inherent nonlinearity and stochastic nature of seismic activity. Therefore, this study examines the application of deep learning methods, particularly a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to create a robust prediction model that outperforms traditional methods. The study comprises six primary phases: data acquisition, pre-processing, exploratory analysis, seismicity characterization, model implementation, and effectiveness assessment. The dataset contained 17,565 earthquake events (M ≥ 3.0) in Central Asia, collected from 1973–2024 via the USGS API, enriched with geological features such as distance to active faults (from GEM datasets) and eight key seismicity indicators. Compared with baseline architectures (standard LSTM and fully connected neural network), the proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid achieved superior performance, particularly in recall (0.80 compared with 0.67) and F1-score (0.77 compared with 0.71), demonstrating its ability to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. The results indicate that using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model leads to a significant improvement in forecasting strong earthquakes. This is validated by ROC-AUC of 0.78 and F1-score of 0.77, supporting a good balance between model completeness and accuracy. These improvements confirm that the regional adaptation of CNN-LSTM, combined with seismic indicators and clustering-based subregionalization, provides a novel methodological contribution to earthquake forecasting in Central Asia. The model reliably distinguishes periods of elevated seismic risk from quiet intervals, supporting practical applications in regional forecasting and seismic risk visualization.},

Data were collected from 14 healthy controls and 17 individuals with Parkinson’s disease-related gait impairments. The proposed approach integrates spectral analysis and digital filtering to remove noise and irrelevant frequency components during signal preprocessing. Motion classification is performed by analyzing energy distribution using discrete Fourier and wavelet transforms, enabling multilevel signal decomposition. Gait recognition—distinguishing between normal and abnormal patterns—is based on energy components in selected frequency bands and their ratios. Neural network classifiers achieved the highest performance, with a mean accuracy of 81.1% and a cross-validation error of 0.123, using data from sensors placed on the left and right sides of the body. Motion asymmetry detected by the model agreed with assessments of neurologists in 88% of cases.

Usually, a single camera struggles to capture a worker’s entire body clearly, which is necessary for precise movement analysis. To improve this, estimating human poses from multiple camera views significantly enhances worker safety by reducing the problem of not seeing all parts of the body. However, most multi-view methods require camera calibration, which is impractical in manufacturing environments. This study introduces a framework for detecting anomalous 3D poses using multi-view cameras without camera calibration. Our approach simplifies the process and reduces costs, involving four main steps: estimating 2D human poses, filling in occluded body parts with affine transformations, converting these to 3D human poses using a Lifting Network, and detecting anomalous poses using a graph convolutional network. By filling in occluded body parts using the affine transformation, we improve the accuracy of 3D pose detection by 1.54% in the term of the Percentage of Correct Keypoints. Furthermore, our graph convolutional network method achieves a 0.943 F1-score in detecting anomalous poses. This framework aims to boost the usefulness of safety systems that rely on accurate human pose data. Our findings confirm that this method is effective and practical for real-world applications.},

This innovative network, grounded in the YOLOv8n architecture, incorporates the C2f-BiFusion (C2f-BiF). This unit greatly improves the ability to represent defect features by employing channel compression techniques, depthwise separable convolutions, and mechanisms for feature gating. Additionally, a Dynamic Perception Pyramid Network (DFFN) is introduced, which establish a cross-level two-way interaction mechanism to achieve multi-scale adaptive feature fusion. A lightweight detection module, low-rank and sparse cross-domain recommendation(LSCD), has been designed to successfully extract local characteristics of small defects while keeping the consumption of computational resources to a minimum. Moreover, we introduce the Focal PIoU loss function, which dynamically adjusts the weights for difficult and easy samples, integrating a joint optimization approach for accurate bounding box regression. This enhances both the convergence efficiency and the accuracy of the model. Experimental findings indicate that DBP-YOLO surpasses the benchmark model (YOLOv8n) with a 3.7% improvement in the mAP@0.5 metric and a reduction in model parameters by 1.21×106, achieving a detection speed of 62.4 FPS alongside an mAP@0.5 of 83.5% on the Jetson Xavier NX platform.

This paper presents a real-time method for tracking sinusoidal reference signals with unknown frequencies within a narrow bandwidth. The reference signals may include multiple harmonics and a DC bias. The proposed approach integrates a sinusoidal internal model with a Two-Degree-of-Freedom control structure. Unlike traditional methods that rely on offline tuning, this technique updates the controller coefficients online. A high-pass filter with notch characteristics (Hf) is used to derive update equations for the Two-Degree-of-Freedom controller and the internal model parameters. These equations are obtained by matching the closed-loop transfer function of the algorithm to that of the desired filter (1 − Hf). The method is evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink using a second-order plant as an example. Two test cases are presented: the first involves a reference signal with a frequency change and a DC bias, while the second includes two additional harmonics. The algorithm is also tested without coefficient updating for comparison. Results show that the proposed method can accurately track signals with unknown and changing frequencies. It keeps the tracking error very small and quickly adjusts to frequency changes, making it suitable for real-time control in dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) is a potentially life-threatening eye condition that encompasses a range of abnormalities, from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving treatment outcomes and minimising complications. This study suggests a novel hybrid method for detecting and categorising OSSN that combines the advantages of conventional feature extraction techniques with deep learning-based object detection. The approach integrates the deep learning-based object detection framework, YOLO (You Only Look Once), with traditional feature extraction techniques, including texture descriptors. The YOLO algorithm detects OSSN lesions in ocular images, while conventional feature extraction methods derive relevant features from these identified lesions. A feature fusion strategy integrates features from the deep learning algorithm with handcrafted features, thus enhancing overall classification performance. Various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, are trained using the fused feature set. The experiment results show that the proposed hybrid strategy can identify and categorize OSSN in ocular images. Performance metrics for the feature fusion model indicate accuracies of 99.04% for KNN, 98.1% for SVM, 97.14% for Random Forest, and 92.38% for XGBoost classifiers. These findings imply that the proposed hybrid method, which identifies and classifies OSSN in ocular images with excellent accuracy and resilience, is a viable tool for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Twin rotorcrafts, such as helicopters with their capability for vertical take-off, hovering, and maneuverability, pose intricacies in missions like search and rescue, medical transport, and operations in challenging environments. Twin rotor MIMO systems (TRMS), which emulate helicopter dynamics, face significant challenges due to nonlinearities, rotor coupling, external disturbances, and limitations in sensors and actuators. These factors hinder controller design, particularly in ensuring stability and precise positioning. Furthermore, undetected faults, the need for real-time sensor data processing, and acoustic interference exacerbate control difficulties, necessitating robust solutions for effective TRMS operation. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fault-tolerant sliding mode controller (FT-SMC) as a robust control solution for TRMS. The controller is designed to manage parametric uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, and faults, ensuring reliable performance. To address the dearth of actual parameter values, a fault-tolerant sliding-mode observer (FT-SMO) was also set up to figure out uncertainties and sensor/actuator imperfections. Implementation of FT-SMC demonstrated significant improvements in the issues related to parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. A comprehensive Lyapunov stability analysis confirmed the stability and convergence of the proposed control strategy, ensuring reliable TRMS operation under challenging conditions.},

The behavior of the ultrasonic transducer is commonly described by using the Butterworth-Van Dyke model, and the determination of the lumped equivalent electrical parameters of the model is important in applications of ultrasonic devices. The model parameters are assessed by exploiting the values of the transducer admittance at different supply frequencies. In this paper the admittance was derived in the following way. A low-cost set-up designed to apply a periodic square-wave signal to the piezoelectric device under test was developed, the corresponding periodic voltage and current signals of the piezoelectric transducer were acquired by an oscilloscope and, after applying the FFT analysis, the first harmonic of each signal was taken and the admittance was calculated. In order to verify the method, two pairs of piezoelectric devices of two different manufactures were considered. The relevant measurements were carried out by both an LCR meter and by the proposed low-cost method. The determination of the Butterworth-Van Dyke model parameters was performed starting from a preliminary estimation based on analytical relationships, and then by using a MATLAB® numerical identification. The electrical parameters derived from the data sets obtained by the developed prototype system resulted in very good agreement with those obtained by the LCR meter, demonstrating the effectiveness of the low-cost method presented in this paper.},

However, conventional aquatic exercise tools, such as buoyant aids and rigid fins, offer limited capacity for providing active assistance or resistance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a wearable robotic device for aquatic lower-limb exercises, equipped with a bidirectional thruster. The robot measures knee joint angles in real time and controls the thrust moment to enable various exercise modes, including passive exercises such as stretching and continuous-passive-motion (CPM), as well as active exercises with assistance and resistance modes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a dynamic model was derived, and its parameters and relationships were experimentally identified. A prototype was subsequently fabricated and attached to a motor-driven lower-leg mock-up. Control experiments were then conducted underwater across the proposed exercise modes to assess the feasibility of the proposed exercise mode. These results verify the feasibility of closed-loop, thruster-based assistance and resistance for lower-limb aquatic exercise, laying the groundwork for forthcoming human-subject trials aimed at elderly and post-operative populations.},

The proposed method integrates frontier-based exploration with Dynamic Spanning Tree Coverage (DSTC), allowing each robot to incrementally map the environment while dynamically replanning its coverage path in response to both static and moving obstacles detected via onboard LiDAR. To enable decentralized execution and prevent task redundancy, the workspace is partitioned using Manhattan-distance-based Voronoi decomposition, ensuring disjoint task allocation and collision-free parallel operation without centralized coordination. The framework is validated through simulations in Python and Gazebo across varying obstacle densities and robot–obstacle speed scenarios. Experimental results show that MRSimEx-DSTC achieves high coverage efficiency (up to 99.5%), minimal overlap, and robust real-time adaptability. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as MR-SimExCoverage and MAC-Planner, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, lower planning overhead, and greater resilience under real-world constraints.},

Although the original Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO) algorithm, which simulates the social and predatory behaviors of beluga whales, shows certain potential in global optimization problems, there is still room for improvement in convergence speed and accuracy. The MSI-BWO algorithm integrates elite opposition-based learning, dynamic refraction opposition-based learning, and cyclone foraging strategies. Among these, the elite opposition-based learning strategy enhances the diversity and quality of the initial population by constructing an opposition-based search space for elite individuals, thereby accelerating the initial convergence speed of the algorithm. The dynamic refraction opposition-based learning strategy draws on the physical principle of light refraction to dynamically and adaptively adjust the algorithm’s search space, significantly improving its global search capability. The cyclone foraging strategy mimics the unique spiral foraging behavior of manta rays, skillfully balancing the algorithm’s performance between global exploration and local fine-grained search. Through rigorous validation on unit optimization problems, the MSI-BWO algorithm demonstrates superior performance in convergence speed, accuracy, and stability compared to the original algorithm and other popular intelligent optimization algorithms, and the algorithm achieved an energy-saving effect of about 8.31%, while significantly improving the imbalance problem.},

This paper introduces a new system that provides dynamic adaptation of Restricted Access Window (RAW) duration to enhance performance by combining an Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Input (ARX) model with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), called the Predictive ANFIS RAW Scheduler (PARS). The PARS method dynamically changes RAW group durations to meet different traffic need, including text, audio, and image. While the ARX model faithfully forecasts group duration, the ANFIS offers adaptive decision-making by using conditions including change, maintain, and alternate based on traffic patterns in real-time networks. Simulations carried out on event-driven scenarios of a large IoT environment comprising 2000 devices show that the suggested framework greatly increases channel usage by 14%, has a 24% decrease in delay, had an 18% reduction in energy consumption, and lowers collision rates by 28% compared to current static allocation strategies.

Existing single-end optimization approaches, such as client-side regularization or server-side control variables, have difficulty maintaining global-local consistency. To address this, we introduce the Federated Learning with Dual-end Gradient Correction and Proxy-free Self-Distillation (FedDGC-PSD) algorithm. On the client side, a self-distillation mechanism based on historical models constrains local prediction consistency via a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss, mitigating overfitting without the need for external data; concurrently, a gradient correction term aligns local updates with the global direction using historical gradients. On the server, dynamic cross-round gradient correction terms use weighted historical gradients to reduce variance accumulation. Extensive tests were run on five datasets against four benchmark algorithms. Results show FedDGC-PSD outperforms FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedDyn by 13.41%, 14.05%, 20.23%, and 3.41%, respectively, on CIFAR-100. In a large-scale scenario with 1,000 clients and 1.5% participation, FedDGC-PSD maintains stable convergence on CIFAR-10, outperforming FedDyn by 17.62%.

In such drive systems, low-voltage inverters powered by batteries operate under very high currents. To increase the output current capacity of the inverters and achieve higher power levels, the use of parallel-connected MOSFETs has become both important and widespread. Extensive investigations and studies have been conducted to examine the main causes of current imbalance in semiconductors, particularly the effects of parasitic factors originating from printed circuit boards (PCBs) and parameter variations due to the manufacturing processes of semiconductor switches on current distribution. Existing active and passive gate driver circuits in the literature were reviewed, and a new control method based on temperature and current feedback was developed to mitigate these effects. Within this scope, a hybrid active gate drive (AGD) circuit was proposed and designed to improve current sharing among parallel-connected MOSFETs. According to the modeling and analysis results, when the AGD is activated, current imbalance decreases from 25% to 5%. To experimentally test the proposed method, a PCB was designed and tested in a laboratory environment using the double pulse test (DPT) method. According to the DPT results, the current difference observed in the second switching event decreases from approximately 17% to 3% when the algorithm is activated. Based on the results obtained, the proposed gate driver has been shown to be effective in improving current sharing, reducing stress and power losses in MOSFETs, and enhancing thermal management and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

This paper introduces the KSSD2025, a novel dataset comprising 838 manually annotated axial CT images for kidney stone segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four segmentation models based on modified U-Net architectures: U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and TransU-Net. We evaluated their performance through 5-fold cross-validation and external tests. All models achieved mean Dice scores above 95%, with modified U-Net reaching 97.06% during cross-validation and modified U-Net3+ showing better generalization to external data. Our results confirm that U-Net-based architectures, when trained on high-quality annotations, can achieve accurate and reliable kidney stone segmentation.

  abstract     = {Ocular tumors pose significant diagnostic challenges due to their rarity and the subtle visual cues they present in fundus images. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, termed ELRC-GI (Enhanced Lesion Recognition and Classification with Grad-CAM Integration), and designed for accurate and interpretable ocular tumor detection. The proposed model integrates VGG19 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks with Grad-CAM-based attention supervision, enabling both high classification accuracy and precise lesion localization. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ELRC-GI incorporates a heatmap-guided loss function that aligns model predictions with interpretable visual explanations, thereby improving clinical trust and diagnostic reliability. We utilize transfer learning by initializing VGG19 and ResNet50 with pre-trained ImageNet weights, freezing the initial layers and fine-tuning the final layers using the RFMiD dataset to adapt the models to the ocular tumor detection task. The model maintains a true positive rate of 96% at a false positive rate of 0.3%, as evidenced by a robust ROC curve. Experimental results on the RFMiD dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELRC-GI, achieving 97% accuracy, 93% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC of 0.98, significantly outperforming baseline CNN models. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model’s capability to highlight tumor regions, even in the presence of overlapping ocular conditions. The ELRC-GI model thus offers a robust, explainable, and clinically viable solution for early ocular tumor detection, setting the stage for broader application in interpretable medical AI.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring rigorous privacy protection while maintaining data utility remains a central challenge in privacy-preserving data analysis. Traditional Differential Privacy mechanisms, such as the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, rely on additive noise calibrated to sensitivity, which often leads to degraded utility, particularly in high-dimensional or low ε regimes. Moreover, these mechanisms lack the flexibility to adapt to the local structure or the gradient behavior of the data. This paper introduces the MDM-Privacy framework, which leverages the ε-MDM-Privacy mechanism, to calibrate privacy noise following sample-level sensitivity. Unlike traditional additive noise mechanisms, ε-MDM-Privacy employs a non-additive, exponential noise model where the privatized output is computed as a function of the form M(x) = C∙eε∙Lp(x), enabling precise control over the privacy-utility trade-off through both the privacy budget ε and the norm order p. The constant C is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations to ensure probabilistic utility guarantees under confidence bounds. Extensive experiments on the UCI Adult dataset demonstrate that ε-MDM-Privacy achieves significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) compared to the classical Laplace mechanism, particularly under tight privacy regimes. The MDM-Privacy also exhibits robustness across different Minkowski norms, confirming its adaptability to various sensitivity geometries. Moreover, the ε-MDM-Privacy is consistent under both parallel and sequential compositions, enabling the execution of an unlimited number of queries without exhausting the privacy budget (ε). These results highlight the effectiveness of ε-MDM-Privacy as a tunable and utility-preserving alternative for differentially private data release.},

Based on Automatic Dependent Surveil-lance-Broadcast (ADS-B) signals and deep neural networks, this paper initiates a re-construction-inversion method. ADS-B signals are for the first time applied to the in-version of atmospheric duct parameters. First, the PL field is reconstructed utilizing the Propagation Loss Field Reconstruction Network (PLFRN) with an autoencoder archi-tecture. Then, the inversion of the duct parameters is conducted by means of the Duct Parameter Inversion Network (DPIN) based on ResNet18. According to experimental results in actual maritime scenarios, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 13% is obtained between the inverted duct parameters and the measured param-eters. In addition, the MAPE between the reconstructed PL field and the results calcu-lated by the traditional Parabolic Equation (PE) method is only 3%. The algorithm ac-curacy is well verified in its applications and points out greater future potentials.},

  abstract     = {The one-bit cross-dipole array employs one-bit quantization to reduce the sampling system overhead while extracting polarization information from electromagnetic signals, thereby lowering the system complexity of the polarization array. However, the existing DOA estimation algorithms for this array utilize incomplete information from the received signals of the array. Cross-dipole array consists of two scalar arrays orthogonal to each other. With one-bit measurements, the array outputs two one-bit scalar array datum. By exploiting the two array datum, we can generate two covariance matrices and two cross-covariance matrices of the cross-dipole array signals. Existing direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms based on one-bit measurements only realize DOA estimation by combining two covariance matrices, resulting in insufficient mining of information. In this paper,we propose a DOA estimation method for completely polarized signals that jointly utilizes auto-covariance and cross-covariance. To do this, we first study the reconstruction of two cross-covariance matrices from one-bit measurements. Based on the analyses of four covariance matrices, we then formulate virtual array datum consisting of four virtual snapshots by difference array technique, called parallel coarray signals. As the parallel coarray signals are coherent although the incoming sources are independent, we employ the spatial-smoothing technique on the parallel coarray signals to perform the DOA estimation. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved for completely polarized signals.},

  abstract     = {Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is crucial for effective control and monitoring of power grids. However, existing techniques face numerous challenges including compromised measurements from cyber-attacks and the need for real-time operations. Traditional PSSE methods based on weighted least squares are susceptible to outliers and convergence issues, while convex relaxation techniques like semi-definite programming struggle with computational complexity. Recent deep learning approaches for PSSE are data-driven but unaware of the underlying physical constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework called learned block successive convex approximation (LBSCA) to address PSSE amidst hidden adversarial attacks. LBSCA utilizes an efficient block successive convex approximation algorithm that provably converges to a stationary point and can be learned via algorithm unrolling. The resulting deep neural network achieves real-time, end-to-end PSSE in fractions of a millisecond, even when attacks are unobserved and the network topology is incomplete. Evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus system under realistic noise profiles and stealthy directional and sparse injection attacks, LBSCA achieves lower state estimation errors by up to a factor of three than state-of-the-art deep learning baselines and delivers inference speeds up to four orders of magnitude faster than classical optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that model-driven unrolling of robust estimation yields both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency, underscoring its potential in improving real-time power system operation’s efficiency and security.},

Then, for each submodule of the faulty bridge arm, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the submodule capacitor voltage value, which is compared with the measured value to further locate the fault to a specific submodule. Finally, the submodule capacitor voltage information is utilized to distinguish between specific IGBT upper and lower open-circuit faults and three typical fault types of voltage sensors.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel framework leveraging drone-based image analysis to improve urban street infrastructure management. With urbanization accelerating, effective street maintenance is critical for sustainable development. The study focuses on streets 6–8 meters wide and 1–20 years old, as defined by 22TCVN 4054-2005 standards. This study aims to develop an integrated analytical framework for urban street infrastructure management, combining drone-based image analysis, ML predictive modeling, and financial assessment. The purpose is to enhance decision-making for street maintenance and sustainability through the application of advanced technologies. The methodology involves three key phases: (1) collecting drone images of urban streets and developing a deep learning classifier to assess street conditions; (2) constructing a Markov model to predict street longevity and usage based on classified data; and (3) creating a financial model to estimate maintenance and reconstruction costs. These three models are designed to work in unison, forming a comprehensive system that transitions seamlessly through condition assessment, prediction, and cost estimation. Using a combined dataset of nearly 2,000 images from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and the public RSXD dataset, deep learning classifiers were trained to evaluate road conditions. Outputs are then fed into a Markov model for usage and lifespan predictions, alongside financial projections for maintenance or reconstruction. The findings reveal a critical disparity in performance: while the models achieved moderate success in assessing the damage severity level, they failed to generalize for the more complex task of classifying the specific damage type, where validation accuracies were low despite high training accuracies. The framework features a Markov model that effectively predicts street longevity, and a cost model aiding financial planning. The framework demonstrates robust performance metrics, validating its applicability in urban street management. This study’s originality lies in its integration of advanced vision recognition, predictive modeling, and cost analysis for infrastructure planning. Limitations include a restricted geographical scope and reliance on specific street dimensions. Future research should extend the approach to broader contexts and refine the models for diverse urban conditions.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life and placing a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Early and reliable seizure detection remains a critical challenge, often hindered by limited availability of high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data and the suboptimal performance of existing classification methods. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both data scarcity and classification accuracy. The first stage involves generating synthetic EEG signals that realistically mimic epileptic patterns using the Variable Structure Model Neuron (VSMN) with multidendrites, providing an effective means of data augmentation. In the second stage, we introduce a hybrid LSTM-VSMN model, where the VSMN activation function is integrated within the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network gates, replacing conventional activations such as tanh. This integration improves the model’s ability to capture complex temporal dependencies in EEG sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage VSMN both for EEG signal synthesis and as an activation function within a deep recurrent neural network for seizure detection. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated against conventional activation functions, achieving an accuracy of 98.16% in single-fold validation and 97.59% under 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as 0.0241 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.41%, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid LSTM-VSMN architecture in enhancing automated seizure detection, offering a promising tool for clinical decision support and real-time monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Container terminals are vital to global trade, and improving operational efficiency is key to competitiveness. Currently, container terminals primarily rely on single-spreader cranes for operations. Some ports have begun introducing dual-spreader cranes to enhance the efficiency of lifting operations. However, the operation of dual-spreader cranes spans multiple bays, significantly increasing the complexity of time-space operations. Research in this area remains scarce. Thus, this paper proposes an optimization method for container inbound scheduling based on dual-spreader cranes. First, a multi-bay time-space network flow model is constructed. Next, a bi-objective function is designed to synergistically optimize the number of obstructing containers and double-lift operations. Existing software has limitations in solving the dual-spreader crane scheduling problem, so this paper develops a novel two-level branch-and-bound algorithm to address it. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better solution quality for both optimization objectives in the double-spreader crane scenario compared to the greedy heuristic algorithm. Additionally, this paper verifies the effectiveness of various optimization strategies in the proposed algorithm through further experiments. Finally, it was validated that compared to single-spreader cranes, the average number of lifting operations for dual-spreader cranes is reduced by 35.67%. The proposed method provides new insights for improving the operational efficiency of container terminals and holds significant value for future research and practical applications.},

In this study, a unique and interpretable COPD classification is proposed. This study introduces a hybrid feature extraction strategy integrating CNNs and ViTs architecture to capture the crucial COPD patterns from the LS’s Mel-spectrogram representation. The proposed CNNs-ViTs architecture addresses the limitations of standalone CNNs or ViTs architectures by capturing fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal dependencies while efficiently modeling non-linear relationships. A novel feature fusion is used to combine the heterogeneous features into a unified and highly discriminative feature representation space. A tailored hyperparameter optimization strategy is developed to fine-tune the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classifying the features into normal and COPD classes. By incorporating internal (552 Healthy and 1324 COPD LS recordings) and external (35 Healthy and 77 COPD LS recordings) datasets, the authors evaluate the model’s performance. The model achieves a generalization accuracy of 97.62% and specificity of 96.51% on the external dataset. Through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) overlays, the model’s interpretability is enhanced. The experimental findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed COPD classification architecture in the domain of biomedical acoustic signal processing. Operating with minimal reliance on specialized diagnostic infrastructure renders the proposed model ideal for primary care and resource-limited environments.},

  abstract     = {Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams lack portable, fast, and intuitive tools for locating victims in low-visibility disaster sites. Existing Direction-Finding (DF) systems are often too bulky, slow, or impractical because they require victims to have specialized transmitters. In this work, we present SearchSense, a portable device in two modalities: handheld and hands-free wearable, that provides left/right directional guidance via augmented reality and haptics to locate a victim’s cellphone. It overcomes the limitations of current systems by using an amplitude-comparison technique to detect unintentional radio frequency (RF) emissions from standard cellphones in the 2.45 GHz ISM and cellular bands, eliminating the need for any special equipment on the victim. In technical tests, SearchSense demonstrated high accuracy, achieving a 5.3° RMS Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) error in a controlled anechoic chamber and 6.8° RMS in a realistic outdoor environment with ground interference, comparable to existing AOA systems. In a user study with four USAR experts, participants found its DF vibrotactile feedback to be highly intuitive and praised its wearable design, confirming its potential to improve rescuer situational awareness and operational effectiveness. USAR feedback indicates that RF-based multimodal guidance could be a viable approach for passive DF in disaster response.},

  abstract     = {With the rising prevalence of lower-limb mobility impairments caused by stroke, neurological disorders, and accidents, there is an urgent need for innovative, cost-effective rehabilitation solutions. This paper presents the design, development, and experimental validation of CoGait, a novel gait rehabilitation robot that employs single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) multi-link mechanisms to enable natural walking patterns on commercial treadmills without independent actuators. CoGait transfers power from the treadmill to its six-link mechanisms, facilitating rehabilitation at low speeds (e.g., 0.4 m/s), which are critical for therapeutic efficacy. Key innovations include: reduced mechanical complexity (fewer linkages) compared to existing systems; ankle trajectory synthesis that accounts for both position and time, closely mimicking natural gait; self-synchronization with the treadmill, eliminating the need for external motor and control; enhanced safety and adjustability, with passive mechanisms for out-of-sagittal-plane motion and adaptability to patient anthropometrics. Functional experiments with healthy participants demonstrated that CoGait generates joint angle profiles closely resembling those of natural walking, achieved through low movement error metrics. The system recorded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.9° for the hip and 4.9° for the knee, alongside high correlation coefficients (CC) of 86.2% for the hip and 95.3% for the knee. These results indicate that CoGait is a promising, low-cost solution for lower-limb rehabilitation, particularly for elderly and mobility-impaired patients, and lays a strong foundation for future research in passive-assistive robotics.},

  abstract     = {Learning from noisy labels remains a significant challenge in deep learning. Although recent methods typically propose single-model strategies, practical implementations often employ dual-model training, particularly in realistic scenarios where no clean validation data is available for identifying noisy labels or selecting clean samples. Existing dual-model methods, including symmetric and asymmetric co-training, have limitations in handling label noise. Symmetric co-training suffers from model convergence in the later stage of training. In contrast, asymmetric co-training lacks explicit mutual updating, limiting its ability to mutually correct or reinforce each other's predictions. To address these limitations, we propose Reciprocal Robustness via Asymmetric Co-training (RRAC). This novel framework leverages two robust models, the Temporal Weighting Model (TWM) and the Early Learning Regularization Model (ELRM), trained simultaneously and exchanging predictive information through cross-updating. TWM utilizes a dynamic instance weighting strategy (CSIW), while ELRM employs early learning-based regularization. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate RRAC's competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising solution for robust learning from noisy labels.},

This work presents a system-level integration and validation study of a hybrid networking framework that combines static, mobility-enabled, and reconfigurable components to sustain connectivity in complex indoor environments. First, a 3-D Voronoi-based deployment of static IoT nodes provides an optimized baseline coverage map. Next, a set of mobility-enabled platforms, ceiling-rail robots and floor Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), form an adaptive layer that can reposition as needed to restore links or extend coverage around obstacles. In parallel, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are strategically placed on walls or ceilings to dynamically redirect wireless signals, creating virtual line-of-sight paths and mitigating shadowing. A multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) coordinates these elements, optimizing coverage, connectivity, and latency simultaneously. Across hospital, office, and warehouse layouts, the integrated system achieves on average 95.6% volumetric coverage and 100% connectivity. Latency and energy-efficiency results are reported together with 95% confidence intervals to highlight statistical robustness. The study quantifies the gains of a unified controller versus sequential or disjoint orchestration and provides sensitivity analyses under RIS quantization and shadowing effects. The contribution is therefore positioned as a practical, unified framework that couples planning, mobility, and RIS operation under non-ideal hardware and channel conditions.},

Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), and renal failure. Background The objective of this study is to establish an association between retinopathy and CVD, which is driven by shared pathogenic mechanisms including inflammation, microvascular damage, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes and hypertension substantially increase the likelihood of DR and HR, which in turn elevate the risk of developing CVD. Objective This work is to forecast the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing retinal vasculature and associated clinical risk factors in patients with DR and HR.Methods The method involves a quantitative diagnostic approach using morphological and physiological attributes of the retinal vascular system, such as the Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR) and the Cup-to-Disc ratio (CDR), which serve as biomarkers. In addition, systemic risk indicators including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, and alcohol consumption are incorporated. Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to detect DR, HR, and CVD and to quantify their characteristic features.Results The results indicate that early investigations based on the proposed approach can effectively identify patients at high risk, potentially preventing up to 90% of CVD cases when detected during the early stages.Implications This study highlight the potential of retinal imaging, when combined with deep learning, to serve as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early cardiovascular risk prediction in diabetic and hypertensive individuals, enabling timely clinical intervention.},

New conclusions about matching have been obtained using the Bode-Fano limit, adding frequency-independent reactances (FIRs) to the formulation for the first time. Moreover, a matching limit can be obtained analytically before building the network, thus providing a performance limit in advance. A lumped network is obtained analytically as a first attempt with the reflection coefficient bounded between two limits with equiripple behavior for a maximum bandwidth. Then, this network model is modified by adding frequency-independent reactances (FIRs) to provide a better match even for asymmetric responses. The lumped network is converted into a distributed network where the dispersion of the lines is accounted for. The next improvement is the conversion into an electromagnetic model, where dispersion is also considered in the inverters modeled with irises. Three examples with increasing bandwidths are considered, and a manufactured prototype is measured to test the good behavior of the proposed matching method.},

  abstract     = {The establishment of a large number of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) increases the attractiveness of Electric Vehicle (EV) use. However, these types of charging stations are classified as mobile and non-linear loads in electrical power systems. This situation introduces new challenges of a scale and nature that electricity distribution networks are not accustomed to. Considering technological changes from the past to the present, it is predicted that Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Stations (EVFCS) will constitute a significant share of all types of EVCSs. Consequently, many electrical issues are likely to emerge in the grid with the integration of these charging stations into the distribution network. Considering the concerns about these potential problems and strategies for mitigating them, it is crucial to examine the possible electrical impacts of EVCSs on the distribution network. In this study, substations, transformer substations, transformer points, HV/LV distribution feeders, and loads belonging to the distribution company were analyzed in the pilot region of Istanbul/Kavacik. The locations of existing stations in the region were taken into account when determining the placement of EVCSs on the distribution network. The simulation of the system is modeled using MATLAB/Simulink software, incorporating real-time technical data such as the location of distribution transformers, power data, load density, and the number and length of feeders, along with data on system protection and control elements. When the simulation results are analyzed, it is noted that the current value drawn in the feeder to which the single-phase EVFCS is connected increases by approximately 32%, while this value rises by 75% in all phases of three-phase EVFCS systems. Although the total harmonic distortion value did not increase significantly in single-phase systems, it was found to exceed the limit values in three-phase systems. It was confirmed that the voltage drops did not surpass the permitted limits.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently Thoutperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: (i) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, (ii) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and (iii) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {The greenhouse gas effect escalates due to carbon emissions from traditional use of fossil fuel, particularly driven by the development and urbanization of the modern world. In this context, solar photovoltaic (Solar-PV) power generation offers a valuable opportunity to mitigate the impact of conventional fuels. However, an accurate forecasting has consistently been a challenge in the context of Solar-PV systems. This paper presents an effort to address this issue by developing a new hybrid deep-learning method named as an improved WT-LSTM model. In first phase of the proposed methodology, the most relevant features that significantly impacted the power generation are selected using various feature selection methods, including Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, coefficient of determination, forward selection, and backward selection. Besides, in second phase, the Solar-PV power generation is predicted by applying the proposed improved WT-LSTM model. The proposed hybrid improved WT-LSTM model adopts a wavelet transform based decomposition of the historical input time series data of solar-PV power generations into various frequency components, from which statistical features are extracted. These statistical features are also combined with meteorological features and become the basis for Solar-PV generation forecasting using improved LSTM. Moreover, the proposed improved WT-LSTM model further incorporates batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization to forecast various time horizons. The algorithmic performance of the proposed model is compared with different other deep-learning models such as Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi LSTM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a basic hybrid WT-LSTM model. All these deep-learning models are tested on two datasets of distinct sites i.e. 1A DKASC, and 1B DKASC Alice Springs Solar-PV system, from 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 with 5-minute resolution. The simulation results show a significant improvement in all the performance metrics obtained by the proposed improved WT-LSTM model compared to other competing deep-learning models. Specifically, the best performance values for a 15-minute forecasting horizon are: MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.38617 and 0.29736, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.78038 and 0.64868, and R2 values of 0.95423 and 0.95592 across two datasets. Furthermore, MAE, RMSE, and R2 values are also favorable for the 30-minute and 60-minute forecasting horizons, indicating that the proposed improved WT-LSTM model delivers superior forecasting accuracy. As these simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid deep learning method increases the prediction precision significantly, it is useful for generation planning and reserve estimation in renewable-dominated power systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method to compensate for distortions that can occur when acquiring radar data from a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. The SAR system is widely used in various fields, including terrain observation, disaster monitoring, surveillance and reconnaissance. However, if the platform carrying the radar sensor moves at a non-uniform speed, distortions appear in the SAR image along the direction of the speed change. Therefore, we propose a CNN-based compensation method to address these distortions, and we evaluate its performance. Experiments are conducted in two distinct environments by mounting a radar sensor on a moving platform and varying the speed of the platform. The range-Doppler algorithm is then applied to the radar data to generate SAR images. Then, we use the CNN-based model to compensate for distortions in SAR images acquired while the platform was moving at varying speeds. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing SAR images captured at a constant platform speed with SAR images before and after compensation. The overall results obtained in three distinct environments revealed consistent gains. Using the proposed method, we achieved a 11.28%p increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 1.92%p improvement in structural similarity index measure (SSIM) in Environment 1. In Environment 2, the method yielded a 20.46%p increase in PSNR and a 3.25%p increase in SSIM. For Environment 3, the results were a 5.88%p increase in PSNR and a 1.55%p increase in SSIM.},

This paper proposes an innovative few-shot RFFI method based on adaptive energy path integrated projection (AEP-IP) and an enhanced neural network, aiming to significantly improve recognition accuracy under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The method integrates an enhanced densely connected temporal convolutional network (DenseTCN), transfer learning, and Meta-Learning (MAML). Key steps include extracting pulse sequences from received signals and constructing four features: ambiguity function (AF), time-frequency spectrogram (TFS), bispectrum analysis (BIS), and intrinsic function-phase (IFP). One-dimensional projection features are extracted through these features. The DenseTCN enables cross-layer feature fusion and serves as the backbone of the Trans-MAML scheme to enhance few-shot learning under low SNR conditions. Validated using real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data, the results demonstrate: (1) Four-timestep feature improve accuracy by 7.9% (25 dB SNR) and 11% (0 dB SNR) compared to two-timestep feature. (2) DenseTCN outperforms TCN by 8.86% under the same conditions. (3) DenseTCN achieves comparable performance to TCN with 100% data using only 20% data (25 dB SNR).

  abstract     = {We develop characteristics-based filter design methods for certain related classes of IIR bandpass filters that have a peak including Generalized-Exponent Filters (GEFs) which are represented as second-order filters raised to non-unitary exponents. Such filters are useful for seismic signal phase-picking, cochlear implants, and equalizers. Instead of requiring specification of a frequency response and tolerance, our characteristics-based methods for filter design accommodates direct specification of a trio of frequency-domain characteristics from amongst the peak frequency, convexity, ndB quality factors, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, maximum group delay, and phase accumulation. We achieve this by deriving filter parameterizations in terms of sets of filter characteristics which involves deriving closed-form expressions mapping sets of filter characteristics to the original filter constants by making sharp-filter approximations. This results in parameterizations for GEFs including ones with simultaneous specification of magnitude-based characteristics and phase-based characteristics (e.g. bandwidths and group delays) which enable designing sharply-tuned filters without significant group delay, and simultaneous control over frequency selectivity and synchronization which is important in designing filterbanks. We demonstrate that the methods directly apply in designing related bandpass and multiband filters. Our methods with direct control over characteristics may also be utilized beyond static filter design for higher-order variable bandpass filter design and may be useful for characteristics-based adaptive filtering. The methods are inherently stable, highly accurate in meeting strict specifications on desired characteristics, simple, and computationally efficient. Furthermore, the general paradigm can guide the development of characteristics-based filter design methods for other classes of filters.},

  abstract     = {Physical layout optimization in integrated circuit (IC) design remains a critical challenge as semiconductor technology scales toward advanced nodes, where traditional electronic design automation (EDA) tools struggle to simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives including routing congestion, power consumption, and timing performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework for multi-objective IC layout optimization that addresses the exponential complexity of modern chip design spaces. Our approach introduces a congestion-aware reward shaping mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation while incorporating domain-specific knowledge through a hierarchical policy decomposition. The framework employs a dual-level architecture where a high-level policy manages global placement strategies and a low-level policy handles detailed placement refinements, enabling efficient optimization across different granularities. We integrate adaptive action space pruning based on physical design rules and propose a novel state representation that captures both local congestion patterns and global routing accessibility. Extensive experiments on OpenROAD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average 23.7% reduction in routing congestion, 18.4% improvement in power efficiency, and 15.2% enhancement in timing closure compared to state-of-the-art commercial tools and recent learning-based approaches. The framework maintains computational efficiency with 40% faster convergence than baseline deep reinforcement learning methods while providing interpretable placement decisions through attention mechanism visualization. Our contributions include the hierarchical policy architecture, congestion-aware reward formulation, and comprehensive evaluation framework that advances the integration of artificial intelligence in physical design automation.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring continuity of service is a primary objective in power systems. In grid-connected microgrids (MGs), islanding poses a significant threat to this continuity. Conventional approaches mitigate islanding by disconnecting the MG immediately after separation from the main grid to prevent overload and ensure safety, but this results in service interruption. This study proposes a dynamic islanding management strategy that maintains uninterrupted service using an optimal dynamic neuro-fuzzy–optical microscope algorithm (OMA). The method integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN), fuzzy logic (FL), and the novel OMA optimizer in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the CNN detects islanding based on active current and voltage measurements at the point of common coupling (PCC) and their dominant harmonic components, obtained from a hybrid MG model. This model is comprising solar panels, wind turbines, a biomass generator, and a storage system. Signal and image processing techniques prepare the measurements for CNN implementation. Upon islanding detection, the second stage is activated, where FL predicts the penalty factor and OMA optimally manages economic power sharing between the grid and the MG. This integration enables safe load coverage without damaging MG components. Performance benchmarking against Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO) and Hunger Games Optimizer (HGO) demonstrates that OMA achieves higher accuracy, faster convergence, and lower execution time. Validation across five scenarios under normal, islanding, and risky operating conditions confirms the method’s effectiveness, reliability, and economic benefits, achieving a 223.7% revenue improvement over the baseline with the shortest execution time. The proposed approach offers a robust and intelligent solution to the islanding problem, ensuring continuous and cost-effective microgrid operation.},

This case study systematically compares Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) for dairy demand forecasting. The models were trained and validated using one year of production and distribution data from a major dairy manufacturing facility in Jordan, representing Middle Eastern market conditions, covering six products: Laban, Shanenah, Labneh, Jameed, Milk, and Zabadi. Novel integration of seasonal decomposition and breakpoint detection techniques identified structural demand shifts during cultural events, particularly Ramadan, providing a methodological framework for incorporating religious and cultural factors into demand forecasting. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using the Diebold–Mariano test, which confirmed that SARIMAX significantly outperformed XGBoost in most cases (p < 0.05), achieving an average accuracy of 94.27% compared with 92.99%. SARIMAX showed superior performance for highly seasonal products such as Jameed (95.78% vs. 91.46%) and Shanenah (94.41% vs. 93.48%), whereas XGBoost offered marginal advantages for stable-demand products like Milk (94.63% vs. 94.48%). Economic analysis for this facility indicates potential inventory cost reductions of 15–20% and waste decreases of up to 25%, demonstrating the business value of enhanced forecasting accuracy.

  abstract     = {Timely screening of liver tumors plays a crucial role in minimizing the risk of tumor deterioration and improving the survival rate of patients. However, the locations of liver tumors in different patients vary greatly, and their morphological characteristics often show significant differences. Moreover, the boundary between tumor tissue and the surrounding healthy liver parenchyma is not clear, which makes the accurate segmentation of liver tumors in CT images a significant challenge. To handle these limitations, we present a modified encoder-decoder network with multi-layer feature interwoven for liver tumor segmentation, named MLFI-Net. In our approach, we build upon the widely used encoder-decoder architecture as the foundational framework. To enhance feature extraction capabilities, we replace the standard convolutional modules with multi-scale atrous residual block (MARB). Additionally, we optimize the skip connection pathways by integrating multi-layer feature interwoven module (MFIM), which enriches the flow of multi-level contextual information between the encoder and decoder stages. In the decoding stage, we further refine the output by employing a multi-branch attention fusion block (MAFB), which selectively emphasizes informative features while suppressing irrelevant or redundant responses. Finally, we conducted a large number of experiments on our self-built dual-phase liver lesion datasets (arterial phase and portal venous phase) and the widely recognized 3DIRCADb dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of MLFI-Net in improving the accuracy of liver tumor segmentation. Specifically, on the arterial phase dataset, MLFI-Net attained Dice of 0.8404, Mcc of 0.8367, and Jaccard of 0.7264. Meanwhile, on the portal venous phase dataset, the results further improved, with Dice of 0.8447, Mcc of 0.8414, and Jaccard of 0.7360. When applied to the 3DIRCADb dataset, MLFI-Net exhibited excellent generalizability, achieving Dice of 0.8844, Mcc of 0.8848, and Jaccard of 0.7972.

  abstract     = {Astragalus membranaceus (AM) holds significant medicinal value in clinical applications. However, the market frequently encounters phenomena where morphologically similar counterfeits are used to impersonate AM, severely affecting the efficacy of medications and drug safety. To achieve rapid and accurate identification of genuine and counterfeit AM, this paper proposes an improved object detection model based on YOLOv8—AM-YOLO. The model achieves adaptive weighted integration of high- and low-level features by designing a gating fusion module L2Hblock. It proposes an improved spatial pyramid pooling structure ESPPF to enhance local saliency and global context awareness. Additionally, the lightweight Faster-Block is adopted to construct the Fc2f module, reducing the model’s computational complexity. Additionally, the introduction of a dynamic upsampling module, DySample, further improves the ability to restore edge details. To validate the effectiveness of AM-YOLO, we constructed the first AM detection dataset, covering 11 common fakes. The experimental results show that AM-YOLO achieves 95.7% in the mAP50-95 metric, an increase of 2.8% compared to YOLOv8, with an inference speed of 176 Frames Per Second (FPS). Compared with the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, AM-YOLO reduces the average error rate by 30%. Moreover, the model can maintain leading inference speed when deployed on devices with different computing power.

  abstract     = {A novel torsion or twist angle measurement sensor, utilizing a flexible silicone rubber material, has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The operation of this sensor relies on the principle of optical polarization, involving two linear optical polarizers placed sequentially with their polarization axes perpendicular to each other. These polarizers are separated by a transparent cylindrical duct structure made from rigid epoxy resin, which efficiently guides the light rays from the source-side polarizer to the detector-side polarizer. Under normal, untwisted conditions, the orthogonal alignment of the polarizers prevents any light transmission. However, when the sensor experiences torsion or twisting around the axis aligned with the direction of light propagation, the relative angle between the polarizers' axes decreases from 90°, allowing a portion of the light to pass through. The intensity of this transmitted optical power, detected by a phototransistor, is directly proportional to the square of the sine of the twist angle, enabling accurate twist angle measurement by monitoring the photocurrent output. A comprehensive analytical model has been developed to precisely correlate the photocurrent with the twist angle, applicable for both narrow and wide spectrum sensing configurations. Validation of this model through experimental measurements across a twist angle range from –90° to +90° demonstrates strong agreement.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) is an emerging topic in evolutionary computation to solve multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) with the help of knowledge transfer (KT). However, the current EMTO algorithms often ignore the information of the search behavior, which only exploit individual information or historical performance when estimating task similarity or transferring knowledge. In this paper, we propose a search behavior learning-based multitask optimization (SBLMTO) algorithm to address the challenge. The search behavior similarity (SBS) strategy is first designed to estimate the similarity of tasks based on the search behavior, so as to adaptively adjust the KT frequency. Then, the knowledge archive is introduced to store the useful transferred knowledge, further enhance the KT efficiency. Next, a two-level transferring knowledge learning (TTKL) strategy is proposed to achieve the effective learning from both the search behavior and the knowledge archive. SBLMTO is tested on the widely used multitask test suites CEC2017 and CEC2022, and the experimental results show that SBLMTO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms, showing its superiority.},

First, the coupling model of long-duration interference signals to the MTLs is constructed via the TL equations combined with the analytical solutions of the excitation fields of MTLs. Then, the FDFD method is applied to solve these TL equations, and new FDFD schemes are developed for calculating the currents on the MTLs and their loads. Additionally, a new FDFD-TL matrix equation is formulated. Finally, the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by the OpenMP parallel technique, is employed to rapidly solve this matrix equation, thereby obtaining the current responses on the MTLs and their terminal loads. The advantages of this method include avoiding late-time instability and lengthy computation times associated with time-domain simulations for long-duration signals, while effectively calculating current responses along MTLs without directly modeling the MTL structures. Numerous coupling simulations of ideal transmission lines and actual power lines excited by various long-duration electromagnetic pulses are presented and compared to the results obtained using the method of moments (MoM) and FDTD-TL method, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multilevel inverters have attracted much attention in recent years due to advantages such as reduced circuit component and simplicity of structure. Existing multilevel inverter topologies are usually associated with challenges such as reducing circuit component, etc. In this paper, two structures are presented, the first topology (topology I) is symmetric, and the second topology (topology II) is an improved topology I that can be implemented both symmetrically and asymmetrically. The basic topology I has a significant reduction in the number of switches compared to similar topologies. In addition, the basic topology I has low conduction losses compared to similar structures at the same voltage level due to the low number of ON-state switches. Topology I uses an H-bridge that has 4 high-stress switches, while topology II uses a developed H-bridge that only requires 2 high-stress switches. Topology II produces high voltage levels with high output power quality in the asymmetric mode. For topology I, phase-shift pulse width modulation (PWM) control is used, and for topology II, nearest level modulation (NLM) control is used. The efficiency of topology I with the values of losses and switch temperatures is also presented for each switch separately. A comparison is made with similar structures in terms of the number of switches and the number of drivers. The comparison results show that at equal levels, the proposed structures require fewer components. To verify the performance of the proposed design, the proposed topologies I and II are investigated from a hardware perspective. A laboratory implementation is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed configuration under steady-state and dynamic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network reconfiguration stands out as a potent approach for reducing power losses in radial distribution feeders, where losses notably are more those observed in transmission systems. The distribution power losses incurred not only lead to costly operations but also contribute to a compromised voltage profile in electric energy grids. Habitual reconfiguration involves adjusting the form of the distribution grid to minimize electric energy losses, with a focus on the electricity demanded by end-consumers. The existing models predominantly address distribution network reconfiguration without accounting for the different types of load demand linked to points of consumption, each exerting distinct power loss effects in contrast to single-type demands. Despite the imperative load type diversity role, most models neglect this aspect. The limited studies incorporating load type into reconfiguration strategies tend to employ non-linear formulations, introducing complexities. While models with non-linear characteristics may be tackled via metaheuristic techniques, they fall short of guaranteeing optimal solutions. Alternatively, solving such models using solvers for non-linear equations in conventional tools of optimization demands computations that require significant time. To address these challenges, the present article proposes an impressive model for reconfiguring distribution networks that consider different load types. Notably, this model is designed for seamless implementation with linear procedures. Our study’s results demonstrate the exactitude of the introduced model in yielding accurate results for targeted reconfiguration challenges, coupled with the advantage of swift execution suitable for real-time reconfigurations.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based virtual impedance (VI) controller to enhance both power sharing and system response under disturbances in inverter-interfaced microgrids. Traditional droop control methods often face challenges due to variations in feeder impedance, which degrade performance. The proposed controller continuously updates its policy based on changes in the operating environment. The control problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the state and action spaces are explicitly defined, and a carefully designed reward function, satisfying system criteria and constraints, guides the learning process toward achieving the desired transient and steady-state performance. By leveraging PPO, the controller improves upon traditional methods by reducing the need for manual tuning and offering better adaptability to varying operating conditions. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated in both islanded and grid-connected modes, using batteries with capacities of 1 MW, 125 kW, and 100 kW. The results demonstrate that the PPO-based VI controller improves power-sharing accuracy and provides better response to disturbances across different scenarios compared to the conventional controller. To validate the performance of the proposed method, an assessment is conducted on the system frequency using key metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and Integral of Time-Weighted Squared Error (ITSE). The PPO controller consistently achieves the lowest errors across all scenarios compared to the conventional controller, with the IAE reduced by 27% in islanded mode and 36% in grid-connected mode.},

While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labelled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design. By addressing key research gaps and providing a strategic framework, this review offers valuable insights for advancing precision agriculture through AI-driven data fusion techniques.},

Through extending the Shanker distribution, the SKSD overcomes the deficiencies of the Shanker distribution, particularly in the modeling of advanced behaviors hazard rate functions. The suggested distribution can represent numerous real-world phenomena due to its different increasing and decreasing hazard rate shapes. Crucial statistical properties such as the quantile function, expansion of the density function, ordinary and incomplete moments, and stress-strength reliability are considered. The model parameters are estimated using both classical and Bayesian methods under adaptive Type-II hybrid progressive censoring with random unit removal. Additionally, the Fisher information matrix is used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to estimate Bayesian credible intervals under symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. It is impossible to compare theoretically estimating processes. In order to investigate the behavior of various estimators and enable comparison using some criteria, extensive simulation research is performed. According to empirical results, relative absolute biases and mean squared errors tend to decrease with increasing sample size. The Bayesian estimate approach typically yields more accurate and stable findings than the maximum likelihood estimate. The SKSD’s adaptable features make it competitive for fitting jute fiber data when compared to the other alternatives.},

Our work addresses significant gaps in current research by offering: (1) a comprehensive overview of methods for binary code similarity; (2) a detailed examination of binary code fingerprinting techniques across various scenarios, from malware detection to digital forensics; (3) a systematic review of vulnerability analysis methods, including control flow graphs, taint analysis, and symbolic execution; (4) an assessment of clone detection strategies, such as text-based, token-based, structural, and behavioral approaches; (5) an in-depth study of authorship attribution techniques, with emphasis on malware attribution methods used in real-world cybersecurity cases; and (6) a thorough review of evasion and anti-analysis strategies, along with their countermeasures. In addition to highlighting the strengths and applications of these approaches, the study also identifies limitations in current methods, such as challenges in malware analysis, vulnerability analysis, and authorship attribution. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including the development of more robust analytical tools, enhancements to attribution models, and the creation of scalable solutions.

Using a repeated-measures design, we examined how task domain (science versus history), presentation modality (video versus text), and linguistic complexity (simple versus complex) jointly shaped cognitive load, self-efficacy, and performance accuracy in 36 Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese. Mixed-effects models revealed a key asymmetry: cognitive load was primarily driven by task features, whereas self-efficacy reflected both task features and disciplinary expertise. Key three-way interactions revealed that expertise moderated the effects of intrinsic load, with only science majors benefiting from low linguistic complexity on science tasks. This expertise also created a motivational buffer, as only science majors’ self-efficacy was sensitive to in-domain linguistic complexity. Furthermore, interactions showed that the effects of modality were conditional on the task’s combined conceptual and linguistic demands. Section-level analyses showed that momentary increases in load were associated with immediate drops in self-efficacy, especially for the science passages. Performance analyses showed a more negative load-accuracy slope for complex than simple syntax, and self-efficacy predicted accuracy chiefly for history and simple syntax. Bayesian mediation suggested a small negative indirect effect overall; the effect was credible for simple passages but not complex. These findings highlight the need for adaptive instruction that manages cognitive demands and supports motivation, calibrated to domain, modality, linguistic complexity, and learner expertise.},

While traditional economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, and interest rates are commonly used to define these regimes, their delayed release limits real-time applicability. Motivated by the forward-looking nature of markets, we develop two Machine Learning (ML) models: a Neural Network and an Ensemble Learning classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are trained on a ten-year dataset comprising 22 financial instruments, including equity sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETFs), bonds, commodities, and volatility indices. To enhance predictive robustness, the study incorporates extensive feature engineering, such as logarithmic returns, rolling volatilities, and moving averages, alongside dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluation is conducted through K-Fold cross-validation and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that the Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 57% on first predictions, rising to 78% when considering the top-two predicted quads. The Ensemble model outperforms with a 96% accuracy, exhibiting consistent classification across all quadrants. The findings highlight the practical potential of ML models to identify economic cycles using asset return behavior. By treating asset returns as early-warning indicators, the study bridges the gap between market signals and delayed macroeconomic statistics, contributing a novel approach to economic state prediction.},

Given the uncertain and volatile nature of RE and electricity consumers’ changing load behavior, the EMSs require accurate net load forecasting, which has become a tough challenge. Unlike prior approaches that might employ a single, fixed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for all data components regardless of their underlying complexities, the model proposed in this paper introduces a specifically designed advanced hybrid machine-learning algorithm for highly accurate net load forecasting in residential areas equipped with solar panels. This involves applying more complex architectures to high-frequency data components and simpler architectures for lower-frequency components. This tailored approach is crucial for optimizing network complexity and computational burden while maintaining or enhancing forecasting performance, leading to comparable accuracy with significantly shorter training times compared to fixed architectures. This paper provides brief descriptions of powerful forecasting tools to accurately predict different variables in power systems and makes a study case of these models in different combinations. Further, they are compared across three different time resolutions of data, discussing their characteristics and different evaluation metrics. The proposed technique shows significant improvement as the time resolution of the input data increases in order to accommodate more intricate details in the RE generation and consumers’ load behavior.},

  abstract     = {The escalating diversity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified security challenges, as signature-based and heavyweight machine learning (ML) defenses often fall short in resource-constrained edge environments, unable to meet real-time demands. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch Gate Time-series Anomaly Detection (PGTAD), a novel, lightweight, unsupervised multivariate time-series (MVTS) anomaly detection algorithm specifically tailored for IoT network traffic. PGTAD is a Gated recurrent units (GRU) autoencoder-based framework that intelligently integrates features from three perspectives—forward sequences, backward sequences, and local patch segments—using a Gate Mechanism (GM). It employs sinusoidal positional encoding for temporal awareness and a patch operation to capture localized patterns. Anomaly detection is achieved via Mahalanobis distance on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments on publicly available IoT network traffic datasets: Edge-IIoTset, CICIoT2023, CICIoMT2024, and CICIoV2024, utilizing both packet-based and flow-based feature perspectives, demonstrated PGTAD's superior performance. Evaluated using various F-score metrics (including point-wise, composite, and affiliation) and inference throughput, PGTAD achieved an average F-score of 0.92 and sustained over 480K packets per second on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB development kit. This confirms its effectiveness and generalizability for real-time detection in IoT edge environments.},

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has driven the evolution of modernized nested microgrids, enhancing resilience and flexibility in power distribution systems. Grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters are central to these systems, with GFL units emulating current sources challenged by uncertain grid impedance, and GFM units emulating voltage sources required to adapt to dynamic load variations. Mode transitions introduce instability through multi-loop control interactions. This work presents a comprehensive dynamical stability analysis of GFL and GFM inverters in nested microgrids, supported by advanced control strategies addressing dynamic response limitations, sensor dependencies, filter fluctuations, and controller complexities. An eigenvalue-based framework identifies dominant oscillatory modes, while online adaptation mitigates disturbances to preserve closed-loop performance. Time-evolution modeling of observables enables enhanced real-time monitoring. A blockchain-enabled decentralized framework ensures secure, transparent, and automated stability actions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrate a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.75% under weak-grid conditions compared with 2.73%, 4.76%, 8.40%, and 2.2% for other approaches and 0.3% under grid-impedance variation and <0.3% under nonlinear loading. The proposed controller achieves 0.06% tracking error dynamics and 0.02% steady-state error, outperforming classical methods (0.32–0.87% and 0.17–0.38%, respectively), with a computational time of 29 ms. The blockchain layer, implemented on the Polygon network, achieved a measured throughput of 1,572 transactions/s, an average block time of 2.3 s, and transaction fees below $0.01 USD, enabling rapid, economical, and scalable peer-to-peer stability service execution.},

One of the most studied topics is energy efficiency, in which different approaches are evaluated to deal with energy consumption and extend network lifetime. Many algorithms can be used to deal with these problems, ranging from simple algorithms to complex machine-learning techniques. However, implementing these algorithms is not an often-explored topic, although essential, because hardware can have particularities that decrease performance compared to simulated situations. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient routing protocol based on an A-star algorithm to improve the lifetime of a WSN. We simulate, implement, and embed into a prototype using ESP-32 to build a real WSN. The aim is to show how the proposed algorithm can improve network lifetime. In the experiments, it was possible to compare the proposed algorithm with LEACH, PEGASIS and others algorithms. The proposed algorithm also is embedded in a low-cost wireless sensor network based on ESP-32 to check if it is possible and whether the use of the proposed algorithm improves the network lifetime.},

Subsequently, a robust reinforcement learning control is designed in conjunction with a switched fault alarm. In particular, the alarm threshold value is used to determine the fault alarmed signal, which is intended to promptly notify the controller to jump from the robust learning controller to the fault-tolerant controller. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach, the asymptotic stability criterion is developed to sustain skillfully in the presence of actuator-faults in the system as well as attains the accurate convergence with the aid of reinforced learning controller.

This paper proposes a novel framework, ED3PO, to address this limitation and improve the objectivity and efficiency of image quality assessment in diffusion model retraining. The framework integrates the D3PO diffusion model with eye-tracking-based deep learning to automate the evaluation of image quality. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 200 participants to collect visual attention metrics during paired comparisons of image quality. Seven machine learning models were subsequently trained, with the best-performing Transformer model used to capture the relationship between eye-tracking data and human image quality assessments. The effectiveness of ED3PO retraining was validated through computational metrics and eye-tracking experiments, and it was further applied to four additional domains. By incorporating eye-tracking into the diffusion model retraining process, this study enables the automated assessment of image quality and the generation of higher-quality images. Furthermore, it offers a reference framework and future research directions for applying eye-tracking technology in the development of diffusion models.},

  abstract     = {The article extends the performance that can be achieved with the setup for the design of higher-order proportional-integral-derivative (HO PID) controllers using ultra-local integrator-plus-dead-time (IPDT) models. The previously derived reference family of controllers, referred to as 1PID, is complemented by a new family of 2PIDs corresponding to the double integrator plus dead time (DIPDT) model. The individual members of the 1PID and 2PID families are derived using the multiple real dominant pole method (MRDP) and normalized by the parameters of the ultra-local models used. The degree of the considered controller derivatives m ∈ [1, 6] significantly outperforms most of the known methods for PID control design, which mainly use m ≤ 1 and only exceptionally consider the cases with m > 1. Therefore, the obtained results are even comparable to the HO controllers created by approximating fractional-order PID controllers. To implement the mth-order derivative, binomial low-pass filters of order n ≥ m are used in the controllers, specified by an equivalent filter delay added to the process. The traditional controllers with two degrees of freedom, for the separate design of setpoint and disturbance responses, are extended by two additional degrees of freedom provided by m and n, allowing to modify the speed of the transients together with their shapes and the closed-loop robustness. The choice of 1PIDs and 2PIDs brings another degree of freedom related to the process model used. The multiple controller parameters are set by a new modification of the Performance Portrait Method (PPM), which makes it possible to shape the closed-loop responses by specifying tolerances for deviations of step responses from their ideal shape in the time domain. The illustrative examples, which deal with two stable higher-order processes and an unstable system, show the possibility of a multiple increase in performance compared to previously known methods. They show that HO-2PID controllers are inherently better suited for processes characterized by multiple dominant time constants. The novel design opens the door to wider use of HO controllers enabled by embedded control and programmable device technology, and allows the development of new HO controllers tuned by parallel computation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for applications such as urban development monitoring, disaster response, and environmental surveillance. However, the performance of deep learning-based models is often hindered by the scarcity of annotated image pairs. Although various semi-supervised and self-supervised methods have been proposed to alleviate annotation requirements, they often lack fine-grained control over the spatial and semantic consistency of changes. To address this limitation, we present GenCD-GAN, a novel generative adversarial framework tailored for synthesizing realistic and semantically consistent change pairs. Unlike conventional GAN-based methods, GenCD-GAN introduces an adversarial consistency loss to preserve structural integrity, an adaptive change masking mechanism to refine fine-grained changes, and a multi-modal augmentation strategy to enhance robustness under diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets show that GenCD-GAN consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art change detection models by generating high-fidelity synthetic training data. Compared to existing approaches, GenCD-GAN offers better interpretability, stronger semantic alignment, and controllable change synthesis. The proposed framework offers a scalable and effective solution to reduce manual annotation efforts and advance deep change detection systems in remote sensing.},

This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses this issue by leveraging a self-supervised learning framework combined with deep supervision and a dual path architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our proposed model consists of two paths: Path 1 employs Vision Transformer blocks, with the initial stage utilizing a pre-trained backbone, while subsequent stages further refine these features. Path 2 incorporates self-supervised learning via the Barlow Twins method to capture global context, followed by ResNet blocks and attention-augmented convolution blocks to extract and enhance local features. The outputs from both paths are fused using a cross-attention module, concatenated, and processed through multiple MLP heads. To enhance the segmentation accuracy, deep supervision is applied at multiple decoder stages, utilizing skip connections from the MobileNetV2 backbone. Additionally, we leverage a modified Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic polyp images for Barlow Twins pre-training. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in polyp segmentation, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios. Specifically, our model achieves an average Dice score of 94% and an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89%, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

In this scenario, transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies play a key role in optimizing training by adapting pre-trained models to new data effectively. This study investigates the impact of different fine-tuning strategies on the classification of pathologies in chest X-ray images. Instead of focusing solely on model comparisons, we analyze how various fine-tuning approaches affect performance when transferring knowledge from the CheXpert dataset to BRAX (Brazilian Labeled Chest X-ray dataset). The architectures DenseNet-121, ResNet-101, and Swin Transformer are employed as tools to assess the effectiveness of these strategies. The fine-tuning techniques explored include full layer freezing, gradual unfreezing of layers, and L1-SP/L2-SP regularization. Model performance is evaluated using ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score, with 5-fold cross-validation ensuring result validity and generalization. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of fine-tuning strategy significantly impacts performance, surpassing the baseline where models were pre-trained on ImageNet and trained exclusively on BRAX.

This study proposes a method for accurately separating radiated electromagnetic noise sources from multiple PFM-controlled DC–DC converters. An asynchronous near-field and far-field measurement scheme is adopted owing to its considerably lower implementation cost than that of its synchronous counterpart. The proposed method extracts individual spike noise, and then identifies and associates each with its corresponding source based on the spatial and temporal characteristics captured by the asynchronous measurements. The experimental results demonstrate improved estimation accuracy across a broad bandwidth, thereby enabling the identification of dominant noise sources. This enhanced accuracy supports more efficient mitigation of electromagnetic interference and reduces the complexity and cost of implementing noise suppression. As a result, the time-to-market can be shortened, facilitating the development of cost-effective electronic products.},

This study addresses this gap by presenting a quantitative assessment of microservices design patterns' impact on modifiability through service-level analysis of 110 individual microservices across 15 open-source applications. Following Systematic Literature Review and Grey Literature analysis, ten modifiability-enhancing patterns were identified and evaluated using a novel context-sensitive selection framework derived from ISO 25002:2024 standards. The framework introduces three key theoretical contributions: the "Worst First" optimization principle for architectural refactoring prioritization, a service-level analysis methodology enabling granular pattern effectiveness assessment, and an evidence-based pattern selection model linking architectural characteristics to improvement potential. Quantitative evaluation using Change Impact Factor (CIF), Service Independence Metric (SIM), and Modifiability Index (MI) demonstrated significant improvements: CIF decreased by 49.7% (from 0.303 to 0.152), SIM increased by 14.2% (from 0.764 to 0.873), and MI improved by 17.6% (from 0.732 to 0.861). Statistical analysis confirmed significance for all metrics (CIF and MI: p<0.0001; SIM: p<0.05) with effect sizes ranging from small to large (d=0.26-0.81). Strong correlations between initial architectural characteristics and improvement magnitude (r=-0.812) validated the "Worst First" principle, where services with poorest metrics benefit most from pattern application. The resulting evidence-based framework enables context-sensitive pattern selection and provides quantified improvement expectations, moving beyond universal approaches to establish scientific foundations for architectural decision-making in microservices development.},

Simulations were conducted in Ansys Zemax OpticStudio using ray-tracing techniques and Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) models to evaluate the effects of surface roughness, interface reflection, and wavelength-dependent absorption. A custom experimental setup was developed using a 375 mm long, 50 mm diameter PVC pipe and a Thorlabs S121C photodiode sensor to validate the simulation. Optical power was measured under five water fill conditions (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). Results show that the greatest transmission loss occurs at the 50% water level, where multiphase scattering dominates, with experimental power decreasing to −11.82 dBm at 583 nm (yellow). Full immersion improves transmission, with recovered power levels up to −2.3 dBm at 475 nm (blue). Absorption coefficients were calculated using the Beer–Lambert Law, with peak values exceeding 0.09 cm⁻¹ at 50% fill. Simulation results aligned with experimental measurements within 1–2 dB, validating the model’s reliability. These findings support the development of adaptive gain control strategies and wavelength-optimized optical links for autonomous robotic inspection in submerged or semi-submerged pipeline environments.},

  abstract     = {The structural integrity of metallic bullet casings is critical not only for military applications—where a single defective casing can compromise ammunition performance and jeopardize personnel safety—but also for industrial manufacturing, where undetected flaws translate into costly rework and production delays. In this study, we present a comprehensive, automated pipeline that combines image processing, feature extraction and machine learning to detect defects in the mouth regions of bullet casings with high reliability and scalability. A dataset of 860 images (440 defective, 420 normal) was captured under varying lighting and camera angles. Each image undergoes adaptive thresholding and morphological opening/closing to isolate the rim contour, followed by Hough Transform–based circle detection and radius comparison to align and normalize the mouth region. Geometric features—including area, perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio, extent and solidity—are computed from the largest contour, while variance analysis of radial profiles captures subtle surface irregularities. Extracted features were fed into a suite of classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), alongside an Artificial Neural Network). The best-performing Artificial Neural Network model achieved 97.3% accuracy on held-out test data, substantially outperforming tree-based and linear baselines. In summary, effective results are obtained when classical image processing techniques are combined with modern learning algorithms for real-time quality control of bullet cartridges used in the military.},

Current studies in ternary logic focus on two aspects: One focuses on designing specific ternary circuits (such as adders, multipliers, and CPUs), and the other proposes design methodologies that make circuit design possible on targeted ternary devices. However, the implementation of large-scale ternary logic requires hardware description language (HDL) and a synthesis methodology that can be applied to various ternary devices. Thus, this study proposes 1) a methodology of ternary RTL-to-gate-level netlist synthesis, 2) a syntax for ternary logic based on Verilog HDL, and 3) the first GT-LOGIC (generic ternary logic) library and mapping strategy for logic synthesis in our synthesis process. Our first RTL-level synthesis method reports that our synthesized netlist shows 63.39% reduced cell count on average compared to the previous MUX-based synthesis. In addition, we emphasize that our methodology successfully synthesizes ternary logic in various ternary devices such as Memristor-based CMOS, CNTFET, T-CMOS, and DEPFET.},

  abstract     = {Accurate building roof boundary extraction from airborne LiDAR point clouds remains a challenge due to abrupt density variations and complex roof structures. Although existing α-shape-based methods are capable of detecting building boundaries, their reliance on fixed neighbourhood selection strategies often results in inaccurate extraction of boundary points in regions with abrupt variations in point density. This paper presents a boundary point extraction technique that selects optimal α values adaptively for individual points by analyzing local geometric point density using an adaptive variable point neighbourhood selection technique. The proposed method first constructs a Delaunay triangulation network from input building roof point cloud data, then iteratively selects optimal neighbouring points from multiple scanlines to compute point-specific α values that adapt to local density variations. This approach effectively mitigates the misclassification of densely clustered points as boundary points by adaptively adjusting to local point distributions. The proposed method is tested on sample buildings of five different datasets with various point densities. Experimental results confirm that this approach outperforms conventional α-Shape-based algorithms, geometric rule-based approaches, and recent adaptive methods by successfully preserving the actual boundary points of a roof while filtering out false positives caused by the fluctuating abrupt point density. The proposed method significantly reduces the Relative Area Error (RAE) and RCC distances, aligning with the expected performance of roof boundary extraction. Furthermore, an ablation study validates the contribution of the proposed adaptive α value and the adaptive neighbourhood selection.},

  abstract     = {Lung diseases are prevalent in today’s world, exhibiting a wide range of disease variations that requires early diagnosis for preventing disease evolvement, diminishing long-term complications, and limiting the fatality rate. Conventional feature extraction methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and classification models like convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), graph neural network (GNN), are associated with high computational complexity, redundance in feature structure, and restricted adaptability due to rigid designs. Moreover, it demonstrates limitations in scalability, generalization over limited datasets, susceptible to noise or illumination and lack of optimized feature sets leading to weak predictive performance. In order to overcome that, a novel framework that enhances lung disease prediction using grey wolf optimization (GWO) based optimized multi-feature extraction with cumulative, recursive learning and a gated multi-layer perceptron (GMLP) for robust classification. This approach provides robustness to noise or illumination i.e. invariant feature extraction, efficient dimensionality and complexity of the extracted features, captures multi-scale spatial-textural patterns through global and local feature fusion and it provides high scalability and generalization capability while maintaining computational efficiency. Also, the optimization approach leads to progressive feature enhancement, knowledge retention, adaptability and redundancy elimination for the extracted features which are further processed by a classifier that selectively integrates full and regional patterns to sharpen feature distinctiveness and improve classification performance. The results obtained from the proposed framework tested on benchmark datasets were encouraging, showcasing notable performance with 98% accuracy outperforming the evaluated baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a critical facilitator of downlink communications in next-generation wireless networks, where user connectivity and spectral efficiency are paramount. The present paper examines dynamic and energy-efficient power allocation in the NOMA systems with imperfect Channel State Information (CSI). To overcome the issues caused by CSI uncertainty and to ensure maximum performance of the system, an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization-Dynamic Power Allocation (APSO-DPA) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has a multi-objective optimization framework that takes into account energy-efficiency (EE), user fairness and the reliability of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) decoding in a combined manner. Simulation results reveal that APSO-DPA has always shown better results in comparison with the conventional fixed and equal power allocation scheme at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Its maximum sum rate at 40 dB is 17.7367 bps/Hz, with an energy-efficiency of 0.00177 bits/joule and a Jain’s Fairness Index of 0.5971. Although EE is expected to decline with elevated SNR as more power is consumed, APSO-DPA keeps the balance between throughput and fairness very high. It also provides better SIC robustness and stable convergence to verify that it is resilient to CSI imperfections. In conclusion, the implementation of APSO-DPA in 5G and next-generation wireless communications is highly suitable as it provides a scalable, efficient, and robust power allocation approach.},

Similarly, Digital Twin (DT) technology is increasingly recognized as an enabler for future wireless networks. To mitigate the challenges posed by building obstructions or natural disasters that disrupt radio propagation, this work incorporates multiple UAV-RIS to enhance connectivity and improve link quality throughout the network. This paper proposes a Multi-Relay UAV-RIS-assisted DT (MR-UAV-RIS DT) framework, focused on intelligent network rate management to ensure User Fairness (UF) and Load Balancing (LB) in small cell (SC)-based wireless networks. In the proposed system, dual-connectivity user equipments (UEs) are simultaneously connected to both the macrocell (MC) via relay UAV-RIS, and to Small cell-Base stations (SC-BSs), all operating in the mmWave frequency band to deliver high-speed connectivity. To meet UF and LB goals, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly control the active beamforming for both SC-BSs and the MC, as well as the passive beamforming and 3D positions of the UAV-RISs associated with SC-BSs and relay UAV-RIS linked to the MC. Due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem, a DT-based multi-task deep reinforcement learning model (DT-MTDRL) is proposed, built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model not only ensures a fair rate distribution among users and SCs but also delivers superior performance compared to existing benchmark schemes, while maintaining robust and adaptive connectivity in dynamic and challenging environments.},

Moreover, dynamic performance can be further improved due to a well-tracked estimated back-EMF on the d-axis. Finally, the proposed position-sensorless FOC based on STA-SMO is implemented and verified on a 0.75-kW SPMSM using MATLAB/Simulink.

Building on the advancements in star sensor detection capabilities, this paper proposes utilizing star sensors as dual-purpose sensors to observe space debris while fulfilling their primary task of attitude determination. A scanning circle (SC) model is established to analyze the observation performance of the space debris located in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt region using star sensors. Based on this model, the optimal optical axis installation orientation of star sensors is derived to ensure full coverage of the GEO belt. Taking a star sensor onboard a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite at an altitude of 700 km as an example, it is demonstrated that setting the installation pitch angle at 13.8° and azimuth angle at 21.2° enables approximately full coverage of the GEO belt through 10 days of long-term observation. Furthermore, by expanding the single star sensor SC model, this paper proposes using star sensors onboard distributed satellite platforms to enhance observation efficiency. The results indicate that deploying 5 star sensors on distributed platforms can achieve rapid full-coverage of the GEO belt within 24 hours. The proposed strategy of using star sensors for space debris observation and the SC model not only expand the application of star sensors into the field of space situational awareness but also open up broader commercial prospects.},

To model the tractor and trailer, both kinematic and dynamic models are derived and utilized to design a state estimator and a lateral control system. To achieve accurate trailer motion estimation, a novel Velocity-Dependent Kalman Filter (VDKF) is developed. Unlike the standard Kalman Filter, the VDKF adaptively adjusts measurement confidence according to vehicle speed, thereby improving hitch angle estimation across a wide range of operating conditions. Furthermore, an advanced steering controller is proposed that integrates trailer dynamics and a prediction-based compensation mechanism for lateral motion delay. By predicting the future states of the tractor and trailer, the controller mitigates the delay effect by incorporating these future states into the control system. The overall objective of this work is to enhance lateral stability and robust path tracking of semi-trailer trucks under varying payloads and steering delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller reduces lateral deviation by up to 86.4% compared to Pure Pursuit (PP) and 53.0% compared to the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), while maintaining robustness under payload variation and a 500 ms steering delay.},

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated its efficacy in synthesizing novel view images, and has yielded promising outcomes under specific conditions: 1) dense, multi-view observations, 2) constrained illumination across input views, and 3) known camera poses. In real-world scenarios, however, these conditions are rarely satisfied. Especially when confronted with a limited number of input views and varying illumination conditions, NeRF experiences diminished performance. While some of the previous works have addressed novel view synthesis under unconstrained illumination, their effectiveness still hinges on dense observations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of few-shot NeRF under unconstrained illumination by leveraging illumination-invariant intrinsic components to provide stronger cross-view regularization. To further enhance practicality, we design a lightweight extension that achieves comparable improvements with minimal computational overhead. We also establish new benchmarks featuring diverse viewpoints and illumination conditions, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework consistently improves robustness and synthesis quality in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the high density and heavy weight of space radiation shielding materials limit their development and application in the aerospace field. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel fast optimization algorithm for shielding material combinations by integrating Particle Swarm Optimization - Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Monte Carlo (MC) method, and Back Propagation (BP) prediction model. Among them, the PSO-DE algorithm can be used to search for potential optimal solutions in a vast material parameter space. The MC method can simulate the interaction process between radiation and shielding materials, providing a basis for evaluating shielding effectiveness. The BP model can quickly predict the shielding performance of different material combinations, accelerating the entire optimization process. It was found that under the condition of 15 individuals per generation, different algorithms performed differently.In terms of optimization results, the PSO-DE algorithm achieved the best performance with the shield design, converging to a minimum mass of 25 kg. The Elitist Genetic Algorithm (EGA) significantly improved the results, achieving a minimum mass of over 30 kg. After optimizing the shield design using these algorithms, the total mass of the final solution that met the radiation value constraints was 1,483 kg, a reduction of 17.4174% compared to the initial method. For the BP model constructed, the average deviation percentage (PBIAS) error in predicting sub-annular dose values was controlled within 20%, and the PBIAS error for photon predictions was below 30%. Although the photon error was relatively high due to the incomplete description of the secondary photon generation mechanism, the predicted values were generally higher, effectively describing the decay pattern of photons.This study proposes a new optimization process to achieve precise and rapid optimization of shielding materials, obtain lightweight and efficient shielding solutions, and provide new ideas for the development of aerospace radiation shielding materials.},

The P4 language enables network operators to define packet processing pipelines flexibly. However, efficiently deploying P4-defined applications onto Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) remains a complex task due to the low-level hardware design requirements. This paper introduces P4THLS, a templated high-level synthesis framework that converts P4 data-plane applications into synthesizable C++ code for FPGA deployment. Key contributions include an automatic design process, a templated data structure and bus width, and unified memory management techniques. The proposed P4THLS architecture is evaluated through experiments, showing significant improvements in throughput, latency, and resource utilization over existing FPGA-based packet processing methods. The experiments demonstrate that P4THLS achieves up to 143.3 Gbps throughput with a 512-bit bus and 76.5 Gbps with a 256-bit bus, supports match-action tables with up to 64K entries, and sustains sub-50-cycle processing latency at 250 MHz, with end-to-end latencies of around 8 μs.},

Existing approaches, including probabilistic road maps and traditional task-and-motion planning (TAMP) frameworks, struggle with high-dimensionality, infeasible actions, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel planning system that seamlessly integrates high-level symbolic task planning with low-level motion execution via a Dynamic Shared-Space Graph (D-SSG) and a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)-based interface layer. The key contribution of this work is a real-time re-planning mechanism that dynamically adjusts to task failures, geometric constraints, and environmental variations, ensuring robust execution. Extensive simulations in ROS and Gazebo demonstrate a measurable reduction in planning time and a significant increase in task success rates under cluttered and uncertain conditions.

To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

The model also incorporates a two-step feature selection technique, Mutual Information-Interaction Gain (MI-IG), to extract the most relevant input features whilst minimizing redundancies. The proposed model was validated using real-world PV power generation data from the Arvand power plant in Mahan, Iran. The results indicate that the the model outperformed traditional methods, including LSTM, MLP, and Elman networks. It achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.001, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.02, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.5%, and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.991—substantially surpassing the performance of the comparison models.

While traditional heuristic and blacklist-based solutions struggle against evolving attacks, this paper proposes a novel stacked ensemble model combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bagging K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Logistic Regression (LR) as a meta-learner classifier. Our hybrid framework leverages the strength of ANN in identifying global non-linear patterns and the proficiency of Bagging KNN in local pattern detection, achieving superior performance through optimal decision-level fusion. Experimental results on 2019-2024 datasets demonstrate that the proposed ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art techniques with a 97.20% accuracy score, a precision of 98%, and a recall of 98%. The proposed model employs hyperparameter-optimised architectures including a 512-256-128-128 layer ANN with Relu activation and 30% dropout, along with a Bagging KNN configuration using 10 estimators with K=7 and Euclidean distance. Key advantages of our stacking approach include enhanced generalization with 2.16% accuracy improvement over the best standalone model, adaptability to emerging attack patterns through weighted averaging, and scalability through the modular design that allows incremental model additions. This study introduces an innovative hybrid ensemble method that stacks ANN and Bagging KNN, incorporating a meta-learning strategy optimized for real-time phishing detection. The model also utilizes SMOTE oversampling to overcome the problem of class disproportion and uses k-fold cross-validation to establish stable performance testing. This study highlights the significance of feature engineering, ensemble methods, and hybrid approaches in enhancing phishing detection.},

First, a time-domain model is used to analyze the noise contributions of the sampling mechanisms: voltage sampling (VS) and charge sampling (CS). Then, based on the obtained noise results, the performance of complete SS-PLL systems is evaluated using a phase-domain model. This approach applies to PLLs utilized as frequency synthesizers with large divide ratios (e.g., 64 to 512) as well as to SS-PLLs operating without a divider in their loop. Although the CS technique can theoretically enhance the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 3 dB compared to VS, the proposed phase-domain model highlights that, within typical power budgets ranging from 1 to 20 mW, a VS-PLL achieves a lower level of integrated jitter than a CS-PLL. This is due to the intrinsic noise of the charge sampling phase detector (CSPD) that, unlike in the VS-PLL, cannot be suppressed and therefore becomes the dominant in-band noise source.},

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

They are not merely cognitive distortions; they can have major political and societal repercussions, including eroding democratic standards, encouraging skepticism about science, and igniting radical ideologies. It is crucial to do cross-country research because the effects of conspiracy theories spread differ depending on the national and cultural setting. Through the identification of its primary individual and sociocultural predictors across nations, the current study provides a detailed understanding of conspiratorial thinking. In contrast to context-specific conspiracy beliefs, we analyze conspiracy mentality, a generic mindset, as a multifaceted disposition influenced by both individual characteristics and larger sociopolitical circumstances, utilizing data from the publicly accessible Comparative Conspiracy Research Survey (CCRS) released in 2023. Through descriptive and inferential analyses, we address a set of four research questions, exploring the socio-demographic, psychological, and political dimensions of conspiracy mentality. Our findings confirm and extend previous insights: while some predictors, such as populism, have a broad influence, others are shaped by specific political and cultural contexts. Importantly, our results are based on an analysis across eight countries, offering a broader perspective than much of the existing literature, which often focuses on single-country cases. Moreover, the present results are not limited to a specific conspiracy theory and rely on data from the general population, rather than from social media users, allowing for more generalizable conclusions about the drivers of conspiracy thinking worldwide.},

An oscillator under these conditions must deliver sufficient power for wireless transmission while being designed with minimal components to reduce the impact of component temperature variation, increase circuit reliability, and reduce the size and complexity of circuits operating in high temperature harsh environment. A simple single supply biasing scheme is also essential to minimize the number of circuit components and to simplify implementation in harsh environments. In this work, for the first time, an oscillator that operates from room temperature to above 300°C using a single fixed voltage supply and a single SiC commercial transistor that outputs more than 12dBm to a 50Ω load was designed, modelled, fabricated, and tested. Due to its few components, simplicity of operation, and robustness, this oscillator can be used for wireless sensing applications over a wide temperature range with the potential to be powered using energy harvesting. The impact of these fabrication and operational conditions is this circuit fulfilling the needs of a wireless sensing application, with potential for self-powered operation, in high-temperature harsh industrial environments.},

The research addresses the need for innovative technological tools that assist therapists in real-time emotional assessment during therapy sessions. The study’s objective was to validate the application’s effectiveness, reliability, and therapeutic usefulness in recognizing five spontaneous emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, and neutrality) in individuals with DS attending a specialized care institution. The study followed ethical protocols approved by the Ethics Committees in Colombia and Ecuador to achieve this. Data was collected during therapy sessions, and three research hypotheses were formulated to evaluate the application’s performance. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using SmartPLS, was employed to analyze the relationships between observed emotional responses and the system’s feedback. The results demonstrated that the application accurately identified the targeted emotions in real time, and 94% of participating therapists positively assessed its usefulness in clinical settings. This validation confirms that the software can provide valuable input for therapists, enabling the design of tailored strategies that address the emotional needs of individuals with DS. The findings support the growing evidence supporting integrating machine learning and deep learning technologies into therapeutic tools for vulnerable populations.},

However, traditional assessment methods rely on subjective clinical evaluations and demonstrate limited predictive accuracy. To address·this·challenge, we propose a multimodal AI-driven airway assessment system. The hardware architecture consists of an integrated camera module, computation module, and display module, while the software is built on a three-stage intelligent framework that comprises image feature extraction, feature-based parameter quantification, and data fusion-based risk prediction. In the feature extraction stage, the framework employs deep learning (DL) models to process input images. Subsequently, the framework automatically measures five critical airway parameters. In the prediction stage, these parameters are fused with personal basic information. Finally, an eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model processes the fused data to generate a final risk prediction for airway assessment. We evaluated the system performance using a dataset including 1,207 patients undergoing general anesthesia. On an independent test set, the DL models for feature extraction demonstrate high accuracy, with the AI-driven system achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.831. The proposed system offers an objective and accurate solution for preoperative airway assessment, outperforming traditional methods.},

EEG signals capture non-invasive measurements of brain activity and provide real-time access to emotional processes at the neural level. Compared to facial expressions or speech, EEG is less susceptible to voluntary masking and therefore holds promise for robust emotion decoding. However, traditional EEG-based ER methods are often limited by low classification accuracy, small sample sizes, and reliance on discrete or bipolar affective labels. Recent advances in deep learning, multimodal fusion, and semantic-space emotion models offer promising directions. This paper reviews state-of-the-art EEG-based ER approaches, focusing on signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques. In addition, we identify emerging trends and persistent challenges, including dataset generalizability, inter-subject variability, and the need for fine-grained emotion annotation. By synthesizing current methodologies and outlining future paths, this review aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in the development of more accurate, scalable, and cognitively grounded EEG-based emotion recognition systems.},

Most traditional algorithms are too complex to be applied in IoT systems due to the limited resources available. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel, lightweight hybrid cipher suitable for IoT applications. Chaotic maps and Cellular Automata (CA) are utilised to enhance the security level of the proposed cypher while maintaining minimal processing demands. The new cipher integrates Tinkerbell and Tent maps into a complex encryption sequence. Additionally, the S-box is generated using a Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM), further strengthening the encryption. This approach achieves strong security, as evidenced by a high NPCR of 99.6053, indicating high sensitivity to small input changes. It also records a high MSE value of 7157.7306, suggesting strong diffusion and scrambling. Furthermore, the key sensitivity achieved was 99.616% having less than 45 MB of memory usage in a Raspberry Pi 4 board with encryption time of 1.22 seconds. These results confirm that the cipher effectively protects IoT data. This lightweight cipher, which offers strong security without excessive power consumption, is ideal for IoT environments. Future work will focus on improving the performance of smaller devices and testing resilience against a broader range of attacks.},

Indonesia, a developing country with high connectivity needs, has allocated frequencies for 5G services, including the extended C-band (3.5 GHz) and mmWave (26 GHz). However, the use of these frequencies can interfere with existing satellite services. Indonesia has gained access to these 5G frequencies at theWorld Radio Communication Conference. Implementing 5G in these bands can cause significant interference with satellite services, affecting operational sustainability and national revenue from the satellite sector. The sustainability of satellite services and the economic impact of interference require effective interference mitigation models. This study consisted of four phases. First, we present a review and analysis of published interference-mitigation models between 5G and satellite services. Second, data was collected from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and experts on satellites, mobile networks, and regulations through in-depth interviews. Third, the data collected and the interference mitigation models were integrated into the Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analyzing Tool (SEAMCAT). Fourth, we analyzed the impact of interference mitigation to enhance non-tax state revenue through a spectrum license fee. The aim was to produce an effective model to mitigate interference, maintain satellite service continuity, and support the implementation of 5G. This research contributes to telecommunications technology in Indonesia and potentially increases national revenue by optimizing usage frequency.},

The depth and weighted depth of DTRs are examples of so-called bounded complexity measures (BCMs) for which this result is valid.

Classical approaches based on generating functions or incremental enumeration tend to suffer from severe combinatorial explosion and require costly post-processing to recover feasible combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce a new construction method using Zero-Suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs) that integrates capacity constraints directly during the decision process. Our approach prunes infeasible branches on the fly and merges identical residual-capacity states to guarantee that each feasible combination is enumerated exactly once, without duplication. We show that the resulting structure is significantly more compact than conventional slot-based Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), especially when the feasible solution space is sparse. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that our capacity-aware ZDD achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in both time and memory efficiency over BDD-based enumeration, even on networks with moderate size and demand values. Beyond performance, our framework provides a canonical and reusable representation of all feasible d-minimal-path combinations, which can be leveraged in reliability analysis, path planning, or network design. These findings support the relevance of ZDD-based models for exact enumeration tasks under resource constraints in real-world infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading plays a pivotal role in clinical decision-making, where precise staging directly impacts treatment planning and blindness prevention. Inspired by ophthalmologists’ diagnostic reasoning—which systematically integrates local lesion assessment with global pathological pattern analysis while incorporating edge and frequency-domain information for comprehensive image analysis—we propose an innovative hybrid framework. This framework emulates the clinical cognitive process through three synergistic components, constructing a clinically aligned feature hierarchy: (1) A Lightweight Mixed-domain Attention (LMA)-driven biomarker localization module enhances sensitivity to microaneurysms and exudates by learning spatial-channel dependencies while maintaining a lightweight architecture. (2) Frequency Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Blocks integrate multi-scale spatial and frequency domain features, mimicking the human visual process in lesion identification. (3) Vision Transformers model long-range dependencies to analyze lesion distribution patterns and quantify pathological severity, analogous to clinicians’ holistic evaluation. The entire model contains only 10M parameters, effectively bridging the local modeling capacity of convolutional networks with the global reasoning ability of transformers. Experiments on the APTOS-2019 and DDR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a grading accuracy of 89.6% and a QuadraticWeighted Kappa (QWK) of 93.1% on APTOS-2019, as well as a grading accuracy of 85.2% and aQWKof 84.9% on the DDR dataset.

This demands robust perception and mapping, as well as control strategies that can effectively utilize environmental information while enforcing safety constraints. However, to address noisy and sparse measurements from inexpensive onboard sensors commonly used on low-power mobile platforms, probabilistic and continuous map representations have emerged as more effective alternatives to traditional deterministic occupancy grids. Despite their advantages in perception and mapping, their integration into safety-critical control frameworks remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a reactive and safe control strategy that operates over probabilistic maps constructed using Gaussian Process-based continuous representations. Our method combines a reactive control framework with control barrier functions, and incorporates risk measures that consider both occupancy probabilities and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, for practical implementation, we introduce an object-level probabilistic mapping approach suited for indoor environments and integrate it with the proposed control strategy. The resulting framework enables risk-aware, reactive navigation in previously unknown environments. We validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating robust vision-based navigation under uncertainty.},

Throughout the paper, for the novelty of the paper, information-theoretic disturbance measure, specifically the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, is formulated in a convenient and structured manner. It is considered as the generalization of Mean Square Error (MSE) disturbance measure. By some manipulations, it is seen that the proposed information-theoretic disturbance is equivalent to MSE disturbance plus an extra term that depends on the variance of the output variable. So, this KL divergence measure captures the variance information of the output variable. The optimal adaptation and combination coefficients in the sense of minimum KL disturbance is derived in closed-form formulas that provides the computational convenience of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over some competing algorithms, while suggesting the impulsive FDI attacks shows its potential in lower detectability than Gaussian FDI attacks.},

While secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) are commonly used, attackers can still exploit metadata to profile users and identify vulnerabilities. This research focuses on analyzing the TLS handshake, where encryption parameters are established. Although newer versions of TLS aim to encrypt the Server Name Indication (SNI), we observed that some devices in real-world environments still transmit SNI in plaintext, potentially exposing device identities. Given this practical variability in SNI transmission among diverse IoT devices, we conducted two parallel studies, one including the SNI and one without it, while avoiding Media Access Control (MAC) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to their inherent variability and privacy implications. We used TLS handshake parameters as input for machine learning algorithms to fingerprint IoT devices, classify them by type, and identify manufacturers. Six machine learning models were evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), XGBoost, and CNN+RF. The results showed that CNN+RF achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 99% for device type classification. However, our proposed countermeasure, which enhances TLS handshake privacy by obfuscating specific parameters, significantly reduced fingerprinting accuracy to a maximum of 80% when SNI was excluded. These findings highlight the potential risks of TLS metadata exposure and demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing countermeasures in mitigating IoT device fingerprinting attacks.},

These models help improve decision-making, anomaly detection, and optimization procedures in intricate energy systems by using vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. This study provides a comprehensive review of the LLM origins, evaluation, and fine-tuning techniques as well as their integration into energy systems, including their application in fault detection and diagnosis, energy forecasting, document automation, energy management, defect detection, and power system operation. Their performance in terms of explainability, generalization ability, and scalability for energy-related applications is critically examined in this paper. The report also emphasizes significant challenges to the adoption of LLMs, such as the need for computing power, the lack of data, and ethical issues like bias and false information. Power-efficient models, hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, and domain-specific fine-tuning are some of the solutions discussed. Future areas of interest include multi-modality to obtain maximal forecasting and operational intelligence, real-time adaptability, and explainable. This paper summarizes current developments and provides information on LLM-driven innovation in energy systems while maintaining transparency and dependability. Compared with prior LLM–energy surveys that either remain general-purpose or focus on a single subdomain, this review fills three concrete gaps: (i) a cross-domain synthesis of energy-specific LLM applications spanning power systems, buildings, and forecasting; (ii) a methods-oriented consolidation of evaluation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning practices tailored to energy tasks; and (iii) a deployment-centric analysis of real-time and edge constraints (energy, latency, hardware) with a practical reporting checklist for operational adoption.},

  abstract     = {Classifying metals is an essential task in all industries to make sure the materials used in the processes are safe and meet the required standards all while enhancing operational and cost effectiveness. Metal classification is crucial in processes such as quality control, recycling, green manufacturing and any other processes that rely on metal. The metallurgical domain relies on techniques for metal classification such as X-ray Fluorescence, Magnetic Induction Spectroscopy and Eddy Current Separation with regards to their speed, accuracy and cost. This work proposes a new system for thermal image based metal classification which is expected to be better in terms of effectiveness, cost and time as compared to the traditional methods. In this work, heat conductivity and specific heat characteristics of metals are taken into account to generate a thermal image map. As different metals have different conductivity and specific heat, the heat absorption and radiation map generated by thermal image can be used to identify the type of metal using a machine learning based classification method. The results show that fused with machine learning Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms in the metal identification system can classify metals with an accuracy of 96% and 98% respectively. These results highlight how machine learning and thermal imaging can offer more precise and reliable results than traditional machinery. This approach presents a practical solution that conserves cost and time.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating regulation threshold heterogeneity into the modeling of emotion diffusion provides critical insights into the spread of negative emotions within complex social networks. This study develops a threshold-based diffusion framework to systematically examine how individual differences in emotional response thresholds influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of negative emotion propagation. The proposed behavioral model assumes that individual thresholds follow a Gaussian distribution, capturing variations in emotional susceptibility across the network. Using edge-based compartmental theory, the model analyzes the propagation process under the influence of threshold heterogeneity. Through numerical simulations and empirical validation, the study demonstrates that increasing the average regulation threshold significantly raises the outbreak threshold and reduces the risk of large-scale emotional contagion. At the same time, heterogeneity in threshold distribution leads to complex nonlinear propagation behaviors, including both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. These findings emphasize the importance of threshold distribution characteristics in shaping propagation patterns, particularly in heterogeneous networks where multiphase dynamics emerge. This research reframes threshold heterogeneity as a controllable structural feature within the emotional diffusion system, offering a refined theoretical foundation and practical guidance for managing negative emotions in social networks and improving system resilience during public crises.},

The results reveal a strong correlation between thermal and mechanical performance, a topic that has been scarcely explored in literature. The coupled simulations show that thermal stresses generate radial displacements even in scenarios where axial displacements would be expected. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that deformations, particularly in the radial direction, can significantly alter the thermal performance of the windings, increasing the hot-spot temperature by up to 11.9%. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between thermal and mechanical phenomena in transformer windings, supporting the development of more reliable designs, advanced monitoring strategies, and improved identification of potential failure causes.},

  abstract     = {Access to reliable and economically viable electricity services remains a major challenge in non-interconnected zones (NIZs), particularly in developing countries. To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive methodology for the simultaneous planning and intelligent operation of distributed energy resources (DERs), specifically distributed generation (DG) units, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and Distribution Static Synchronous Compensators (D-STATCOMs), within unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model aimed at minimizing total system costs over a 20-year planning horizon, while accounting for technical and operational constraints under dynamic conditions in both renewable generation and electricity demand. To solve the model, three metaheuristic optimization techniques were implemented: the Chu–Beasley Genetic Algorithm (CBGA), the Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA), and the Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWOA). Each algorithm was independently executed 100 times in two representative test scenarios: a 25-bus system based on the distribution network of Leticia, and a 37-bus system derived from the San Andrés Island network. This evaluation enabled a statistical comparison of performance, convergence behavior, and repeatability. Results indicate that BWOA achieved the greatest cost reductions, with savings of 26.9304% and 35.6691% in Leticia and San Andrés, respectively. The selected configurations complied with all voltage and current constraints, while significantly reducing reliance on conventional diesel-based generation. These findings confirm the technical and economic viability of the proposed approach for the simultaneous integration and operation of DERs in isolated power systems.},

Therefore, this paper employs statistical methods to unravel the seasonal, periodic, and heteroscedastic dynamic characteristics of inertia using data from the British power grid over the past five years. It integrates the principles of inertia generation and external environmental influences to demonstrate that power system inertia exhibits seasonal, heteroscedastic, and periodic fluctuation characteristics. Furthermore, this paper provides a reasonable explanation for the change mechanism of inertia by comparing and analyzing the inertia, load and renewable energy generation simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Efficient railway track maintenance is critical for safety, operational reliability, and cost-effective asset management. While traditional inspection methods are well-established and comply with safety regulations, they face challenges in providing continuous, real-time monitoring capabilities that could enhance preventive maintenance strategies. This study introduces a hybrid machine learning framework for real-time anomaly detection in railway tracks, leveraging unsupervised clustering and spectral analysis to improve defect identification. The proposed approach integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and MiniBatch K-Means clustering with a novel distance-from-mean spectral analysis technique to detect deviations in accelerometer signals from in-service locomotives. Vertical and lateral axle-box accelerations undergo Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) processing, generating normalized spectrograms that ensure signal consistency. Clustering identifies major anomalies based on spectral pattern shifts, while the distance-based method enhances sensitivity to subtle defects. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model effectively detects 1.5–3.5% of track segments as high-risk across different railway routes. The combination of clustering and spectral deviation analysis enhances anomaly detection sensitivity, improving the identification of track defects. The framework was validated against ground truth data from Metro Valencia's track inspection records on Lines L3 and L9. Results revealed global recall scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.83, and weighted recall scores up to 0.97, depending on the method and track line. Clustering-based detection showed strong performance in identifying track width and lateral deviation issues on L3 (up to 1.00 recall), while the distance-based method excelled in detecting twist-related anomalies on L9. These findings confirm the complementary strengths of both methods in practical railway scenarios. The proposed framework complements existing inspection systems and can support enhanced maintenance planning and early defect detection. Future work will focus on expanding validation campaigns, integrating additional sensor modalities, and refining detection thresholds for broader deployment in transport operations.},

  abstract     = {Split Computing (SC) is a method that partitions a deep neural network into a head model running on resource-constrained edge devices and a tail model executing on powerful servers. The edge device computes intermediate feature maps, which are sent to the server, significantly lowering local computational demands and reducing communication compared to sending raw input data. This results in improved latency-accuracy trade-offs, enabling real-time inference of large models on constrained edge hardware. While previous research on SC primarily focused on improving training methods, model optimization through automated design approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) remains limited due to substantial supernet training time. This paper proposes a novel method that efficiently applies NAS to SC by fine-tuning a pre-trained supernet from a general Two-stage NAS framework into one tailored for SC. Using publicly available pre-trained supernets significantly reduces training time. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better latency-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art NAS and manual SC designs, requiring only about 13 to 15% of original supernet training time. Additionally, for a practical case study on object detection using the COCO 2017 dataset, models optimized with our proposed method as backbones achieved a 69% latency reduction and 0.4% improved average precision over the EfficientDet baseline.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly quadcopters, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes operations including defense, tactical surveillance, disaster response, and GPS-denied missions. However, aerodynamic stall—caused by conditions like vortex ring state or rotor stall—remains a critical failure mode that can lead to sudden lift loss and catastrophic crashes. This study presents a hybrid stall prediction framework that unifies physics-informed synthetic data generation, interpretable machine learning, and embedded rule-based logic for real-time, onboard risk assessment. A custom simulator was developed to generate 25,921 stall-prone flight states by modeling key parameters such as throttle, vertical speed, blade angle of attack (AoA), airspeed, disc loading, and thrust-to-weight ratio. Using this dataset, an XGBoost classifier was trained for binary classification with two output classes: stall and non-stall, and optimized via threshold tuning and SMOTE-based class balancing. Using this dataset, an XGBoost classifier achieved 0.97 precision, 0.98 recall, 0.98 F1-score, and 0.96 accuracy for stall prediction after integration with domain-specific rules. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to provide transparent, instance-level justifications, revealing that throttle, VRS, and disc loading were consistently the top contributors to stall predictions. In parallel, domain-specific aerodynamic rules—such as critical AoA and high disc loading thresholds—were deployed to catch edge cases such as near-threshold predictions, ambiguous vortex ring state regions, or unseen aerodynamic configurations. This modular system is designed for compatibility with onboard processors like Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time deployment even in resource-constrained environments. It supports frugal innovation without compromising safety, making it suitable for stealth drones, ISR swarms, payload-carrying UAVs, and companion-computer-based quadcopters. By combining data-driven predictions with physics-aware rule triggers, the system reduces false negatives and false positives, improving reliability in mission-critical conditions. Ultimately, this work pushes drone autonomy toward proactive, explainable, and hardware-efficient safety mechanisms—where UAVs not only predict aerodynamic stall but also justify it in real time.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

Based on this, this paper systematically investigates the axial ratio using a generalized loop antenna model: a regular polygon loop antenna (RPLA) with N arm elements. The investigation reveals the following: (1) The axial ratio for a current with a positive phase constant (β > 0) is identical to that of a current with a negative phase constant (−β < 0), provided that both currents have the same attenuation constant α. (2) As N decreases from infinity (corresponding to a round loop antenna) under a fixed attenuation constant α, axial ratio degradation increases. However, if the attenuation constant α is small, even an equilateral triangle loop antenna (N = 3) can radiate a CP wave. (3) Among RPLAs, the round loop antenna provides the best axial ratio performance. (4) Axial ratio degradation is mitigated when a reactive current is generated on the loop.},

The base-station antenna module utilizes miniaturized ultra-wideband monopole elements to achieve 4 × 4 MIMO operation with omnidirectional coverage, while the V2X module employs a 2 × 8 directional patch array to ensure high-gain train-to-train communication. A commercial GPS module with circular polarization is also integrated for precise positioning and synchronization. The antenna system was fabricated and tested through full-wave simulation, lab measurements, and full-scale field trials. Measured results demonstrate stable operation across all frequency bands, high isolation, and low envelope correlation coefficients, validating the system’s suitability for deployment in next-generation autonomous railway networks.},

  abstract     = {Projection mapping, which maps a projector input (i.e., an image) onto a physical surface, is widely used to display user-specified visual content. However, the projected content can become distorted when an ideal surface, such as a flat and white plane, is unavailable. As a result, adjusting the projector input using a projector compensation technique becomes necessary to ensure that the projected image matches the user-provided target image. While various techniques have been proposed for projector compensation, a recent approach models projection mapping as a simulatable process in virtual space, where a light transport algorithm simulates the projection mapping. In such rendering frameworks, projector compensation is typically achieved by iteratively adjusting the projector input via a gradient descent-based optimizer, starting from an initial guess (often chosen arbitrarily). In this paper, we investigate how to set the initial values more effectively rather than choosing them arbitrarily. As the main contribution of the paper, we propose a new initialization scheme that determines the starting values based on a lighting model. We then integrate this model-guided initialization into gradient descent-based optimization and demonstrate that it improves projection mapping results, particularly for non-planar and colored surfaces.},

  abstract     = {To reach sustainable production and consumption patterns, recycling is a key task. Automating the recycling process, especially in sorting tasks, is a strong hope to improve the efficiency and economic viability of the recycling industry. Especially the determination of textile properties such as cotton content is an important task in recycling and the textile industry as a whole. Approaches using NIR-spectrography are common, but can be costly and produce complex datasets. We therefore propose a visual approach to classify fabrics after their cotton content. For this, we apply a novel triplet-architecture approach with a variety of modifications. We combine ResNet50, EfficientNetB4, and DenseNet121 in this architecture in order to make use of their respective strengths while overcoming the weaknesses of the models. For a further accuracy enhancement, we modified all three architectures with adaptive feature pyramid networks, and we added a deformable convolution layer to ResNet50 and DenseNet121. Additionally, we use a second fully connected layer to enhance the model’s classification capacity. With this architecture approach, we achieve an average Root Mean Squared Error of 14.77%, setting a new benchmark for visual approaches to cotton-content classification using cross-validation. We further prove the effectiveness and enhanced accuracy of using a triplet model approach, as well as using all of our modifications. Visual approaches are not market-ready yet, but we show the potential of deep-learning methods for lowering labor-intensiveness and time needed in textile property determination. By that, the recycling industry can be made more efficient and economically viable, helping to come closer to circular economy practices in the textile industry.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates lane visibility distance on urban and suburban roads in Slovakia using a single-camera system under various weather conditions. The study aims to understand how environmental factors and road quality influence lane visibility, employing a single-frame road distance estimation method that is affordable and scalable. The methodology involves rigorous data cleaning, including frame filtering and the application of empirically defined thresholds, to further improve the accuracy of lane detection. The analysis highlights variability in lane visibility influenced by weather conditions, with rain and snow typically reducing visibility; however, snow along roadsides can enhance lane detection on well-maintained highways. The type of road is also a significant factor, with highways offering the best visibility, while city roads and mountainous suburban roads pose challenges due to intersections, tight turns, and uneven terrain. Over 96 drives, we observed median lane visibility distances of 82.2 m on D2 highway and 78.7 m on D1 highway compared to just 51.6 m on urban roads, with analyzable frames representing 86.8% and 77.3% of highway data compared to 47.4% in urban environments, and down to 42.6% in rain. The results demonstrate both the feasibility and limitations of employing a single-camera setup for real-time AI-based lane visibility assessment, providing insights to improve road safety technologies and adapt them to diverse urban and suburban environments.},

  abstract     = {Alternate arm converters (AAC) are emerging as one of the most efficient voltage source converter (VSC) topologies in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems due to their advantages over conventional modular multilevel converters (MMCs). Compared to conventional MMC, they benefit from fewer number of submodules (SMs), lower capacitance per submodule and DC fault ride-through capability. However, the AAC VSC controller must ensure appropriate regulation of AC currents in both overlap and non-overlap modes while maintaining minimal harmonic distortion. This paper presents an optimized control design method for the half-bridge (HB) AAC VSC using a Fuzzy Logic (FL) controller. The average modeling of multilevel converters is used to reduce computational burden, and the proposed FLC scheme is employed to regulate AC and circulating currents. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated under short and extended overlap operating modes. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed controller against changes in VSC design parameter of overlap period is also investigated to examine the proposed scheme usefulness in different operating conditions. A two-terminal HVDC link using AAC VSC converters is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and simulation results under different operating conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

In large-scale robotic process automation (RPA), managing quantities of tasks executed by software robots that run 24/7 is critical. It calls for an end-to-end solution comprising planned schedules, service level agreement (SLA) compliance, server capacities, and system outage avoidance strategies. This paper proposes a new business-driven data model for RPA monitoring to enhance the evaluation and maintenance of software robots in 24/7 environments. The literature review confirmed a lack of flexible data models for RPA monitoring with a business orientation, particularly in big environments. The business-driven data model contains three domains, thirteen enumerations, seven entities, and 116 attributes for enabling seamless robot task execution. The quality is measured against five established criteria related to data models. Moreover, the Center of Excellence (CoE) applies the business-driven data model in a Shared Service Center (SSC). The CoE manages over 170 robotized tasks, ensuring efficient operations. This research increases the monitoring and assessment of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to work effectively and efficiently with software robots.

However, most real-world networks are dynamic and evolve over time; the traditional models cannot capture temporal evolution. Moreover, the existing temporal link prediction methods mainly use simple GNNs to learn spatial embeddings, which not only ignore the high-order relationships and local clustering structures between node, but also perform poorly in static graph link prediction tasks. In order to address the above problems, we propose Hypergraph for temporal link prediction (HGTLP) which is based on enclosing subgraph extraction. The proposed HGTLP constructs hypergraph through enclosing subgraph extraction and dual hypergraph transformation to learn the high-order spatial and temporal embeddings of each link to be predicted, and then combines the global knowledge of the collapsed graph to improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that HGTLP achieves significant performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art models in both link prediction and new link prediction tasks.},

Using monthly corn price data from 2014 to 2024, the study evaluated model performance based on different evaluation metrics. The results indicated that the Neural Network Auto Regressive (NNETAR) model outperformed traditional econometric models, effectively capturing complex temporal structures and adapting to sudden market fluctuations. Additionally, hybrid models integrating NNETAR and Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS Model (STLM) demonstrated further improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting that combining statistical and machine learning methods enhances predictive reliability.

This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings. Specifically, the focus is on differentiating between healthy and faulty bearings by analyzing key predictive variables—temperature, engine speed, and humidity—and their effects on bearing vibration responses. Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {Energy optimization is a major issue in wireless sensors networks (WSNs) due to its direct impact on the network's lifetime. This paper proposes the use of the K-means algorithm combined with linear programing to lengthen the lifetime of three-dimensional WSNs. First, the K-means algorithm is used to obtain simple but effective initial clustering of the WSN and then the communication links between the sensors are optimized using linear programing to decrease energy consumption and improve the lifespan of the network. Linear programming is applied here to determine which sensor connections should remain active to minimize a formulated linear objective function while ensuring that a minimum number of sensor nodes remain connected. A sleep/wakeup scheme is implemented in this proposal in order to reduce energy consumption further and increase the lifetime of the network. The proposed method is evaluated alongside two existing algorithms: The first one is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm and the second one is the multi-hop low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (MH‑LEACH) algorithm. Across simulations, the proposed technique consistently outperformed both algorithms in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption. Specifically, on average, the proposed algorithm extended network lifetime by 48% versus MILP and by 78% versus MH‑LEACH, while reducing energy usage by 22% and 54%, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed approach uses only homogeneous sensors with finite energy while the MILP approach assumes that the sink nodes have infinite energy, which might be impractical. Therefore, the proposed approach is more practically implementable, reduces the number of the communication links to be optimized, and avoids the need for infinite energy sink nodes.},

To fulfill the aim of this study, five research questions are formulated, which enable systematic navigation through existing studies related to the topic. These research questions are directed to providing answers to privacy related to data leakage, privacy connected to sensor types, privacy related to different applications, privacy concern with sensor deployment locations and building types, privacy issues with data processing methods, and to highlight mitigation strategies for reducing privacy invasion.

  abstract     = {Interdependent infrastructure systems serve as the foundation of modern society, ensuring the delivery of essential services, economic stability, and public well-being. The increasing integration of these systems, driven by advancements in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), has improved operational efficiency and adaptability. However, this interconnectivity and interdependency have also introduced vulnerabilities, making infrastructure networks more susceptible to cascading failures, cyber attacks, and disruptions from natural disasters and human-induced events. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for addressing these challenges, offering data-driven solutions for reliability and resilience analysis across interconnected infrastructure networks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of GNN applications in interdependent infrastructure systems, including transportation networks, power distribution networks, water distribution networks, and communication networks. By leveraging spatial-temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and physics-informed learning, GNN-based approaches enhance predictive accuracy, system resilience, and decision-making efficiency. This review underscores the potential of GNNs in infrastructure management optimization and risk mitigation, and enabling the development of more sustainable, adaptive, and resilient infrastructure systems in the face of evolving challenges.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous drones in complex urban wind environments must balance speed, safety, and energy efficiency under highly variable conditions. Traditional single-policy reinforcement learning controllers often perform poorly when exposed to scenarios beyond their training. We introduce a Pareto-optimal multi-mode framework that trains three specialized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) policies (aggressive, balanced, and cautious) via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with specific reward scalings, yielding controllers that collectively span the speed-safety-energy trade-off surface. To automate mode selection, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on 30,000 simulation-derived environment-performance tuples, allowing it to predict the optimal policy from building density, wind speed and orientation, battery state, and recent flight history. In a Unity-based Manhattan simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind fields across four headings and 10 speed levels, the LLM-driven decision maker reduces average flight time by 16%, lowers the collision rate by 50%, and saves 18% energy compared to any single mode, while preserving nondominated trade-off performance. The decision maker also generalizes to unseen wind patterns and layouts without handcrafted heuristics, demonstrating the promise of combining Pareto-optimal reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-based meta-decision making for UAV autonomy.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP), which learns audio-language representations by aligning audio and text in a common feature space, has become popular for solving audio tasks. However, CLAP’s audio features lack generalizability, whereas self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer general-purpose features that perform well across diverse audio tasks. We aim to develop a broadly applicable audio representation and hypothesize that a model that learns both general audio and CLAP features should achieve our goal, which we call a general-purpose audio-language representation. To implement our hypothesis, we propose M2D-CLAP, the first approach to jointly learn effective general audio and CLAP features. It extends an SSL masked modeling duo (M2D) by incorporating CLAP and utilizes LLM-based sentence embeddings. The training process consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, generalizable audio features are pre-trained via a multitask objective combining M2D and CLAP, with CLAP leveraging LLM-based semantic embeddings to distill semantic knowledge into them. In the following stages, CLAP features are pre-trained and refined with guidance from the learned audio features. Experiments demonstrated that M2D-CLAP learns high-performing general audio features (e.g., AudioSet mAP of 49.0, SOTA results in music tasks) and CLAP features, thereby enabling a general-purpose audio-language representation.},

  abstract     = {Stepped-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SC-OFDM) radar is an emerging low-cost alternative to traditional OFDM radar for automotive applications. It offers high-range resolution without increasing the sampling rate. However, it suffers from the Doppler intolerance in high-speed target detection, which arises from Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in peak power loss and increased range sidelobes in the range-velocity map. In addition, the maximum unambiguous velocity is reduced by the number of frequency steps. This paper proposes a novel range-Doppler processing method for nonlinear stepped-carrier OFDM (NSC-OFDM) radar systems to mitigate the problems. The proposed method employs a two-stage Doppler compensation approach: initially applying all-cell Doppler correction under unambiguous velocity assumption, followed by ambiguous-cell Doppler correction for ambiguous targets identified through range sidelobes. The method can automatically resolve velocity ambiguity by selecting the hypothesis with optimal sidelobe suppression, achieving effective ICI mitigation. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method; meanwhile, the good performance of the proposed method on range sidelobe reduction, estimation accuracy, and computational complexity are shown by comparisons with three other methods.},

This paper presents Hybrid Stable AnoGAN (HS-AnoGAN), an enhanced anomaly detection framework based on AnoGAN (Anomaly Generative Adversarial Network), which utilizes generative adversarial learning to model normal anatomical structures and identify abnormal regions indicative of pathology. The proposed approach introduces key improvements, including direct latent space encoding, hybrid reconstruction loss, feature matching in the discriminator, and adaptive thresholding, leading to more precise anomaly localization. Additionally, spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent mode collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply anomaly detection techniques for arterial plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound images. Comparative experiments demonstrate that HS-AnoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.8% increase in detection accuracy, and a 7.5% enhancement in Dice score for segmentation quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of HS-AnoGAN in improving both plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound imaging, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.},

First of all, eccentricity problem within two circular boundaries is handled by using bilinear mapping to transform two eccentric circles in S-plane to two concentric circles in T-plane. Then magnetic field in the slotted STPMM with concentric rotor is predicted according to conformal mapping, double reaction theory, superposing principle complex relative air-gap permeance, and nonlinear magnetic network. After that, back electromotive force(BEMF) and torque are obtained according to the results of magnetic field. The calculating results show that open-circuit and on-load air-gap flux density, cogging torque, BEMF, and static torque of STPMM considering rotor eccentricity and pole shape by the proposed analytical method are in good agreement with those predicted by finite-element method. Analytical results of BEMF and static torque are also similar with experimental results.

With the increasing realism of AI-generated content, distinguishing between authentic and fabricated information has become increasingly challenging, especially in low-resource and multilingual content. In this work, we propose a novel bias and sensitivity-aware multilingual deepfake news detection framework, BSM-DND, which classifies news articles into three categories: Authentic (A), Fake but Not Dangerous (FND), and Fake and Dangerous (FD). Our approach incorporates language-specific preprocessing to extract features related to sensitive keywords, sentiment polarity, and structural complexity. To enhance efficiency in large-scale detection, the Bloom filter technique has been applied for rapid parallel keyword matching. By leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), and recursive feature elimination, we have optimized classification performance across multiple languages. Experimental results on English, Italian, and Bengali datasets demonstrate that our method has achieved high detection accuracy, with the most significant improvements observed for English language content, while also yielding substantial gains in the other two languages. In addition, the BSM-DND framework is scalable in low-resource environments, adaptable to multilingual scenarios with minimal overhead, and effective in quantifying the potential societal impact of deepfake news.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is widely recognized as the gold standard for the non-invasive assessment of cardiac structure and function. Among the key clinical biomarkers, left ventricular volume and ejection fraction are routinely estimated from CMR images to evaluate cardiac performance. This paper presents both fully automated and semi-automated frameworks for LVEF estimation at end-systole and end-diastole, with the primary distinction lying in their segmentation methodologies. The proposed pipeline consists of image enhancement, heart localization using Fourier transform techniques, segmentation, and volume estimation. In the semi-automated system, segmentation is achieved through a learning-free region growing algorithm, augmented by global thresholding and an optimized seed point selection strategy. The automated approach employs a deep convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Both systems incorporate inter-slice spatial continuity to enhance segmentation consistency across short-axis slices of the left ventricle. Experimental evaluation was conducted on a dataset comprising 4,400 short-axis CMR images. The proposed methods achieved Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) values of 0.053 and 0.015 for the automated and semi-automated systems, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches, particularly the learning-free method, in handling anatomical and imaging variability. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed systems to support reliable and efficient LVEF quantification, thereby contributing to improved clinical workflows and decision-making in cardiovascular diagnostics.},

Existing approaches like SimCSE and PromptBERT have limitations in sample generation efficiency and volume. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-mask prompt template strategy that greatly increases the quantity and efficiency of positive and negative sample generation. Our method uniquely allows each template to simultaneously produce a positive and a negative sample. Furthermore, to eliminate noise interference caused by prompt templates, we introduce a simple difference-based noise separation technique. Concurrently, we extend the InfoNCE loss function to optimize the learning of feature space distributions. We used the SentEval toolkit to evaluate our method on seven standard text similarity datasets. The results show that, without any external data augmentation, our method achieves an average Spearman correlation coefficient of 78.52, performing comparably to or surpassing some classical methods. Comprehensive ablation studies rigorously validate the individual effectiveness of our dual-mask prompting, noise separation strategy, and extended loss function.},

Classical cryptographic hash functions have effectively ensured the integrity of digital evidence. However, they cannot be applied to quantum evidence emerging with the advent of the quantum computing era. This is due to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. To address the challenge of ensuring quantum evidence integrity, this paper introduces a quantum amplitude hash function as a new paradigm. The function operates by directly hashing the entire amplitude, which represents the totality of information within the quantum evidence state, into a hash qubit. The proposed function is implemented as a quantum circuit of constant depth, ensuring excellent scalability. It is theoretically proven to satisfy key cryptographic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance, and sensitivity. Moreover, simulation experiments were conducted to validate the generation of hash qubits for representative quantum algorithms. This work is expected to lay a crucial technical foundation for advancing the field of quantum forensics and preparing for future investigative environments.},

  abstract     = {Balancing assembly lines is one of the biggest problems facing industrial processes. Conventionally, this balancing consists of optimally allocating production tasks between different workstations or stations, taking into account precedence, capacity and cycle time constraints. However, in the face of today's dynamic environment (fluctuations in demand, technical hazards, labor shortages, etc.), static balancing is no longer sufficient. Companies need dynamic rebalancing solutions, designed to adapt task distribution in real time as soon as a perturbation appears. Our study based on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) offers a potentially attractive approach. MAS enable decision-making to be decentralized, with each agent representative of a workstation, a set of tasks, an operator or a piece of equipment. Each agent assesses its situation locally (workload, availability, etc.) and negotiates with the others to achieve a more flexible, proactive assignment of tasks, in line with the principles of Industry 4.0 (connectivity, distributed intelligence and adaptability). The approach proposed in our study is a dynamic framework based on the use of three agents, each of which executes and cooperates with the other agents in order to determine parameters with high variability, propose adjustments and implement them. The results found show that the use of the dynamic balancing environment facilitates monitoring and decision-making through a dynamic dashboard including a set of KPIs specific to balancing. The operational impact of implementing this environment shows a significant increase in terms of productivity and availability, implicitly the synthetic rate of return (‘OEE’) of the production line. As a result, the financial aspect of reconfiguring the line has been reduced thanks to the recommendation agent, which proposes future adjustments without impacting the production line. The line balancing no longer depends on a single a priori measurement, but is instead adapted on an ongoing process, giving greater strength in the face of the uncertainties of a VUCA world.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses the classification of typical baseband signals to be found in computing devices picked up without any physical contact, just using RF probing. The automatic classification applies a convolutional neural network and alternatively, by tracing dedicated signal properties that are specific for certain signal formats. The neural network classification is based on a time-frequency transform preprocessing. We selected a low-resolution Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), but other options, such as the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) outputs are also presented. We analyzed simulated and measured signals. We found that classification is possible with very high reliability, even based on low-resolution representations that the human eye cannot distinguish, such as for Ethernet 100-BaseT and 1000-BaseT. Both studied approaches can be nicely combined for enhanced classification performance. We briefly discuss jamming as a possible countermeasure to protect against eavesdropping.},

  abstract     = {An undeniable signature is a type of digital signature in which the signer retains control over whether their signatures can be verified by others. Furthermore, it enables signatories to revoke their signatures in cases of significant compromise or disputes. Due to the great trend towards undeniable signatures based on lattices, the key and signature sizes are still large, which leads to concerns about efficiency. This work proposes a new undeniable signature scheme depending on approximate-ISIS problem, including signature verification, disavowal procedure, and key generation. We analyze the security of the proposed signature scheme against known cryptographic attacks on undeniable signatures. Also, we demonstrate that our scheme possesses completeness, soundness, and invisibility properties. Moreover, under the suppositions of the random oracle model, that propositioned signature is resistant to existential forgery. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce both the public key and signature sizes by half compared to designs based on accurate trapdoors.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the measurement of the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructures. The methodology used, aligned with ISO standards and guidelines for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM), involves several steps. First, a checklist is prepared, encompassing all the elements necessary for the infrastructure’s implementation, operation, and end-of-life stages. Then, the environmental impact of each element is modeled in terms of probability distributions, which, in the metrology framework, indicate the lack of complete knowledge about the true amount of emissions associated with the related element. The obtained distributions are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulations to yield an overall distribution of the infrastructure’s environmental impact. Upon determining the resulting emissions, this paper presents the novel concept of the Sustainability Balance. This concept is introduced by comparing the emissions generated by the considered infrastructure with those mitigated through its use. This balance is critical for determining the actual environmental sustainability of the infrastructure. As a practical case study, this methodology is applied to a real and complex monitoring scenario, namely the dynamic fourth lane of the Italian A4 motorway, which represents a comprehensive example of an ICT infrastructure. The Dynamic Fourth Lane allows the emergency lane to be used as an additional traffic lane based on traffic volume, thereby reducing congestion and emissions from idling vehicles. The obtained results highlight the potential for significant environmental benefits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in evaluating and enhancing the sustainability of ICTs.},

The data fusion center receives information from the local sensors and fuses them to obtain a final global decision on one of two hypotheses. In this paper, we first revisit and formulate the three major approaches of data fusion in multisensor distributed detection systems in the general case of n distributed sensors; namely, centralized data fusion, hard-decision fusion, and soft-decision fusion. The formulation is based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion assuming that the local sensors are independent and observe the same phenomenon. Then, we propose a new multiple-bit decision fusion approach in multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion. Unlike most of the published studies related to hard-decision fusion, the proposed approach is based on fusing multi-bit decisions instead of fusing one-bit decisions. Unlike most of the published studies related to soft-decision fusion, the proposed approach can be applied easily to identical and non-identical sensors and can be extended easily to any number of sensors and any number of bits per decision. Furthermore, it does not depend on the derivatives of the equations related the false alarm and detection probabilities of the individual sensors and does not require excessive computations as the number of bits per decisions increases. The proposed multiple-bit decision fusion approach is derived and its global performance is evaluated and compared to other fusion approaches in case of noisy Gaussian and Rayleigh distributed observations.},

Pre-trained transformer models typically contain millions of parameters that have been trained with comprehensive datasets improving their generalization, allowing them to be fine-tuned quicker and with less data. Therefore, starting with a pre-trained model provides a substantial advantage over developing a network from the ground up. However, the race to exceed the accuracy of previous model generations leads pre-trained model to increase in size and the required computational resources for inference, as well as training. This is where compression techniques are vital to maximize the impact and performance of the models, while minimizing the cost to deploy. This work covers six of the most successful compression techniques including pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization, adaptive inference (early exit), low-rank factorization and mixture of experts.

One of the most severe threats to FL systems is poisoning attacks, which can disrupt model convergence or manipulate prediction outcomes. Addressing these attacks is particularly challenging due to the distributed and opaque nature of FL. To proactively strengthen defenses, we propose HoneyFED, a novel mitigation strategy based on deception. HoneyFED introduces a global decoy model that misleads and disrupts malicious actors by creating obstacles in their attack process. When a potential attacker is detected, the system engages them and captures their poisoned attack methods. This information is used to design a convincing decoy model that appears legitimate to the attacker. As a result, attackers are tricked into believing their attack has succeeded, discouraging further attempts. We evaluate the realism of our decoy using three criteria: indistinguishability from the real model, credibility over time, and viability in influencing attacker behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that HoneyFED effectively defends FL training against various poisoning strategies while improving overall model convergence.},

  abstract     = {The detection of low levels of analyte concentration in biomedical fluids such as whole blood, blood serum, platelets, etc., is quite challenging for medical diagnostics and sensing applications. The difficulty mainly arises due to the fact that these biofluids usually exhibit high permittivity with significantly high dielectric losses, thereby posing challenges for their accurate dielectric testing using microwave sensors. Additionally, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, etc., and internal noises can also introduce errors in the measurement limiting the use of these types of sensors for low analyte concentrations. To address these challenges, a novel differential microwave sensor based on a microstrip line-fed Wilkinson power divider and combiner, along with a pair of identical substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) resonant cavities is proposed. The proposed differential configuration achieves low limit of detection (LoD), high quality factor (Q), and high sensitivity by effectively nullifying common-mode errors caused by environmental fluctuations and internal noises. The parameters of the proposed differential RF sensor are first optimized using the CST microwave studio for a better performance. The sensor performance is verified utilizing the dielectric testing of industrial liquids and medical grade solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform and deionized (DI) water, with a maximum error of ±2.69%. The designed sensor is then utilized for blood glucose concentration measurement with a minimum LoD of 5 mg/dL in the heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to emulate the dielectric characteristics of blood. The proposed RF sensor can be potentially developed as a standalone real-time glucose concentration monitoring system.},

Four categories of antecedents were assessed: technological performance, user experience, ethics and safety, and sociodemographic and individual differences. Trust in AI was also analyzed in relation to behavioral intention to use, learning outcomes, and AI acceptance. Results showed that technological performance was the strongest predictor of trust, followed by user experience and individual differences, while ethics and safety had a relatively weaker impact. Trust in AI significantly predicted all three outcomes, underscoring its mediating role. Moderator analyses revealed that high-level feedback enhanced the effects of technological performance and ethics on trust, and that trust was generally higher in learning-support tasks than in academic writing tasks.

Existing methods typically rely on a single network architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) or Transformer for lane detection, CNNs captures local details but lacks long-range context, while Transformers extract global semantics at the expense of fine local detail, often resulting in imprecise localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D lane detection framework that integrates both CNNs and Transformer architectures to simultaneously harness local and global information. Specifically, we introduce a viewtransformation module based on Spatial Cross-Attention to optimize bird’s-eye view (BEV) feature representation. Then we designed a Dual-Branch network, where the CNN branch extracts fine textures and edges, and the Transformer branch captures global semantic relationships. Finally, a feature fusion module (FFM) combining spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms dynamically merges these features to enhance detection performance. Experiments on the OpenLane and Apollo datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms current advanced methods under various complex road conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.},

First, the dynamics of nonlinear SCSs are transformed into linear subsystems through Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy frameworks. Then, the time-dependent nonfragile sampled-data controller (NSDC) with communication delays is developed to mitigate parametric uncertainties and attenuate external disturbances via H∞-control theory. In contrast to existing NSDC methods, the constructed NSDC signals vary over time within each sampling period, thereby enhancing robustness and control performance. Thereafter, a novel integral inequality is developed to estimate the integral quadratic terms, where free-weighting matrices are uniquely assigned for each sampling stage and can take distinct values for different aperiodic sampling periods. To further reduce conservatism, an augmented dual looped-type Lyapunov functional (ADLLF) is introduced to fully utilize the knowledge of the aperiodic sampling pattern and communication delay effects. Subsequently, by leveraging this ADLLF along with the proposed integral inequality, sufficient conditions are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure the robust asymptotic stability of the T-S fuzzy SCSs with H∞-performance level γ. Finally, the performance of the considered SCSs is validated through numerical simulations, and a comparative example demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) have significantly improved power system reliability and stability by integrating renewable energy sources as voltage sources. Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs), which require an external power source for synchronization, GFMIs operate independently by using internally generated reference signals to regulate voltage and frequency, enabling stable operation even in islanding mode. However, since they primarily depend on reference signals, manipulating these signals can lead to grid instability. While some studies have explored anomaly and cyber-attack detection in conventional power systems, the cybersecurity of GFMIs remains insufficiently addressed, leaving critical vulnerabilities that could disrupt their operation (e.g., power generation system shutdown, frequency oscillation). As cyber-attack techniques advance, these gaps pose significant risks in the transition toward carbon neutrality. This work proposes a novel anomaly classification framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to address the cybersecurity challenges of GFMIs, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Hijacking attacks (HIJ), and short-circuit faults. The model classifies inverter operational states and detects potential anomalies based on measurement signals at the point of common coupling (PCC). Contrastive case studies conducted in MATLAB/Simulink® demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 90% accuracy in anomaly detection and classification, leading to precise deployment of countermeasures. Implementing this approach in GFMIs ensures maximum renewable energy integration with resilience and enhances grid security, supporting a safer transition to a carbon-neutral future.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of earthquake frequency is currently a critical challenge. Several deep learning models have been developed but the sequential processing often limits the ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Therefore, this study proposes a novel Ensemble Convolutional NARX (Ens-ConvNARX) framework where the convolutional feature extraction is embedded directly within the NARX feedback loop to enable a more integrated learning approach. The performance of the framework was validated across two tectonically distinct regions, including West Coast Sumatra, Indonesia, and Southern California, USA. It was also benchmarked against five baseline models which were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. The results showed the superiority of the Ens-ConvNARX model which achieved multi-step predictive accuracies up to 88.5% in West Coast Sumatra and 90.2% in Southern California. An ablation study also confirmed the critical role of the Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) filter, as its removal reduced the one-month-ahead prediction accuracy by 50 percentage points. This study presents a robust and generalizable framework for seismic prediction and shows the important synergy between advanced model architecture and rigorous data preprocessing for improving disaster preparedness and response in seismically active regions.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires intelligent Battery Management Systems (BMS) for accurate voltage prediction, ensuring battery reliability, longevity, and efficiency. Traditional BMS architectures rely on rule-based monitoring, which lacks predictive capabilities for early fault detection and proactive maintenance. This study presents an AI-driven BMS framework, integrating K-Means clustering and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to enhance real-time voltage forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that focus solely on clustering or deep learning, this research combines both methodologies to create a robust predictive system. K-Means clustering segments battery voltage data into operational groups, improving predictive accuracy by organizing similar voltage behaviors. GRU networks then capture sequential voltage dependencies, enabling precise voltage fluctuation predictions. Experimental validation was conducted using voltage data from 120 lithium-ion battery cells, recorded at 20 km/h under three load conditions (Load 0, Load 10, and Load 20) over a 5-minute duration. The findings demonstrate that K-Means clustering effectively categorizes battery voltage states, while GRU-based forecasting achieves high accuracy, reinforcing the practicality of AI-powered predictive maintenance. This study advances AI-driven BMS frameworks by demonstrating the integration of clustering and deep learning for voltage prediction, providing a foundation for real-time battery diagnostics and predictive analytics.},

  abstract     = {The Visual Cryptography Scheme (VCS) is a cryptographic technique that relies on the human visual system rather than computational decryption to recover the concealed image. In VCS, the secret image is divided into two or more shares, and the reconstruction of the original image is achieved by superimposing these shares. There are two primary approaches within VCS: one that utilizes a codebook, and the other known as the random grid approach that operates without a codebook. In both methods, grayscale images are first converted into halftone representations using various techniques, and the resulting halftone images are then encrypted using VCS algorithms. Notably, neither the encryption nor the decryption process explicitly encodes grayscale values. This study introduces two novel algorithms: one designed for grayscale recovery within the general codebook-based (VCS) structure and the other tailored to the random grid VCS (codebook-free). Both algorithms are scale-invariant (without pixel expansion) and adhere to essential security requirements. Furthermore, the proposed methods were evaluated against the most recent state-of-the-art algorithms using two complementary approaches: quantitative analysis based on the Mean Structural Similarity Index Measure (MSSIM) and qualitative assessment through visual inspection.},

However, their potentials in human-inclusive environments remain underexplored. To assess the feasibility of world models in facilitating human-robot interactions, we propose a robot framework using a deep generative model that jointly predicts multiple future observations and actions. Our approach leverages first-person-view (FPV) raw sensor data, integrating both observations and actions to enhance predictive capabilities in dynamic human-populated settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating a range of candidate futures for one condition and planning actions based on observation guidance.

  abstract     = {In DC distribution networks integrating distributed generation, DC transformers (DCT) exhibit asymmetric forward and reverse power flows, with reverse power flow range being limited. Based on this characteristic, this paper proposes a hybrid resonant (HR) DC-DC converter for DCTs. Distinguished from traditional dual active bridge (DAB) converters and Hybrid Non-resonant (HNR) DC-DC converters, the proposed HR converter features a low-voltage hybrid resonant bridge composed of a low-voltage-side active bridge (LAB) and a low-voltage-side diode bridge (LDB) in parallel, enabling efficient adaptation to such asymmetric power flows. It not only satisfies power transmission requirements but also simplifies system complexity and reduces costs. Key technical aspects, including converter topology, operation modes, suppression of circulating currents in reverse mode, and impact of leakage inductance in high-frequency transformers, are analyzed in detail. Comparative studies show that the HR converter reduces semiconductor costs by 33.43% and conversion losses by 16.22% compared to DAB and HNR converters. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and performance benefits of the proposed converter.},

The ultra-wide range is achieved using exciting wideband modes where modal significance ≥ 0.8. The three notched bands (NBs) are designed by introducing various slots in the radiator, which produce radiation-cancelling modes with opposite current directions at the corresponding slots. Then, a four-element MIMO antenna is created by arranging each antenna element (AE) in an orthogonal configuration. The multiply-shaped structure, combined with a square ring, provides orthogonal modes for high isolation between AEs. The MIMO antenna construction achieves 2−16.49 GHz bandwidth, 6.72 dB peak gain, and more than 75% radiation efficiency with >16 dB isolation between the AEs.

However, its impact remains underexplored, and whether to include SPS as is in future standards remains an open issue, calling for a deeper understanding of its effects. In this paper, we introduce a simpler method for implementing the persistence concept in 5G NR-V2X Mode 2, providing a broader range of persistence degrees than standard SPS. Through ns-3 simulations, we show that higher persistence improves communication stability, but it degrades the AoI by slowing sub-channel switching. Conversely, weaker persistence strikes a better balance between collision occurrence rate and collision duration, minimizing AoI. Crucially, our results reveal that Dynamic Scheduling (DS) can outperform SPS even for strictly periodic traffic flows, challenging the longstanding assumption that SPS is optimal in such scenarios. In fact, it turns out that persistent collisions boost message delivery burstiness, creating large gaps in the flow of delivered update messages. Our findings offer clearer guidance on designing simpler, more effective sidelink multiple access strategies to improve communication timeliness.},

By encoding domain specific buyer and seller personas along with linguistic behaviour rules, the method produces contextually coherent and semantically diverse dialogues that reflect authentic communication styles. Evaluation results demonstrate that the augmented data preserves key stylistic features (high cosine similarity), maintains lexical diversity (TTR), improves fluency (perplexity), and enhances coherence and lexical richness (ROUGE-L), outperforming traditional augmentation method. Furthermore, statistical validation confirms the semantic consistency and stability of the generated data.

  abstract     = {Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) reception is acknowledged as a primary source of positioning error in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications, particularly within dense urban settings. When the direct satellite path is obstructed by buildings and other structures, receivers must depend on the reflected signals. This reliance results in significant pseudorange biases and a diminished localization accuracy. Methods based on learning have been developed to classify signals as Line-of-Sight (LOS) or NLOS using signal features; however, many approaches depend on external sensors, heuristic thresholds, or hand-crafted features, restricting their scalability and adaptability. A hybrid deep learning (DL) framework is proposed to address these constraints, integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an Autoencoder to improve LOS/NLOS signal classification utilizing raw GNSS measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using the UrbanNav dataset, which offers dual-frequency multi-GNSS observations from urban canyons in Hong Kong and Tokyo. The training process encompasses feature normalization, class balance, and structured learning, with optimization conducted through the Adam optimizer and dynamic learning rate scheduling. It has been demonstrated through experimental results that the proposed approach achieves a global classification accuracy of 99.90%. For LOS signals, an accuracy of 99.95% is recorded, along with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 100%. In contrast, NLOS signals are accurately captured with 100% in all evaluation criteria. These outcomes highlight the robustness and precision of the proposed method, rendering it highly suitable for applications necessitating reliable urban positioning, such as autonomous driving, UAV localization, and pedestrian navigation.},

While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, data in the power sector presents unique challenges—including complex formatting, limited structured annotations, and extensive use of domain-specific terminology—that hinder the direct application of general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms often struggle with long procedural texts due to high computational overhead, excessive resource consumption, and unstable global semantic representations, further limiting their effectiveness in power workflow modeling tasks.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a domain-adapted LLM framework tailored for the standardization of electric power workflows and introduces a specialized model, Lumina BPM, designed for this task. The model incorporates a hybrid sparse self-attention mechanism that retains attention on initial tokens and dynamically selects the most relevant historical tokens based on query context. This design reduces the need to compute full-sequence dense attention matrices, thereby lowering computational costs while improving the model’s ability to capture critical information from lengthy and complex process descriptions.Experimental results show that Lumina BPM accurately transforms standardized procedural texts into executable piperflow statements and generates corresponding BPMN 2.0 diagrams. The proposed approach significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of workflow modeling, offering a practical pathway toward intelligent process standardization in critical infrastructure domains.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as inferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs’ performance in obscured communication.},

  abstract     = {Partial shading poses a significant challenge in photovoltaic systems by creating multiple peaks in the power-voltage curve, complicating the task of accurately tracking the Maximum Power Point. Traditional maximum power point tracking methods often struggle to identify the true Global Maximum Power Point, leading to suboptimal energy harvesting. This paper proposes a novel hybrid tracking framework that integrates fuzzy logic, synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and time-series modeling with Transformer architectures. Fuzzy logic improves resilience to input uncertainties by translating raw data into interpretable fuzzy values. GANs augment the dataset by generating realistic synthetic samples, thereby improving generalization. The Transformer model leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal patterns in solar irradiance and power profiles. By combining these strengths, the proposed method delivers a robust and accurate global maximum power point tracking solution, particularly under dynamic and partially shaded environments. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and scalability compared to conventional maximum power point tracking approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an event-triggered cooperative localization scheme and a pursuit control method for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the purpose of tracking and monitoring multiple moving target vessels in a maritime patrol scenario. In the proposed method, each UAV has an optical sensor that measures its distances to the target vessels moving on the water surface. In particular, each UAV combines its own measurements with those of other UAVs to be subsequently processed using an event-triggered distributed extended Kalman filter algorithm to obtain its estimates of target vessels’ positions. The UAVs then use the position estimates of the targets to construct dynamic convex hulls that connect all of the detected moving target vessels. The multi-UAV tracker system then generates spatio-temporal reference path curves using cycloid-type trajectories with a formation geometry that is adapted in such a way to cover/contain the constructed convex hulls of the target vessels. Based on the generated reference path, a distributed cooperative control law based on the moving path following approach is finally proposed to maintain tracker-target’s relative geometry that guarantee accurate tracking of the moving vessels. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effective performance, computational efficiency, and scalability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Securing information in future mobile networks is particularly challenging for devices with limited computational resources. In such contexts, physical layer security (PLS) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the inherent randomness of wireless channels. When full secrecy cannot be guaranteed, the partial secrecy regime provides a realistic and effective approach to system design. This study investigates the partial secrecy performance of wireless systems operating over the recently introduced generalized multicluster fluctuating two-ray (MFTR) fading model. This model is highly regarded for its adaptability in representing a broad range of propagation environments and includes various classical fading models as exceptional cases. We consider a secure communication setup involving a transmitter (A), an intended receiver (B), and an eavesdropper (E). Inspired by previous work showing the benefits and simplicity of diversity schemes for improving PLS, we assume that both B and E are equipped with antenna arrays and apply maximal ratio combining (MRC). The model also considers independently but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) fading conditions on the A → B and A → E links. We derive exact and closed-form approximate expressions for three central metrics in partial secrecy theory: generalized secrecy outage probability (GSOP), average fractional equivocation (AFE), and average information leakage rate (AILR). Unlike previous approaches based on simpler fading models, the proposed expressions maintain a constant computational complexity, irrespective of the number of diversity branches, and are compatible with standard mathematical tools. Validation via Monte Carlo simulations confirms the accuracy of the derived expressions and highlights the impact of key system parameters on secrecy performance. The flexible MFTR framework enables assessment across varied fading conditions. In particular, increasing the number of MRC branches at B improves the GSOP diversity order and alters PLS behavior based on the fading characteristics of the A → E link.},

The software can model radars and Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) based EW systems. Its open architecture structure allows users to input the parameters of radar and EW systems for modeling.

The performance of the software was tested using commercially available Software-Defined Radio (SDR) equipment to establish a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup. Results from multiple scenarios demonstrated that the simulation software effectively implements EW techniques in accordance with the conditions and scenarios defined by the user.

This poses severe security threats to various domains, including banking, customer service, and law enforcement, as malicious actors can exploit speech synthesis techniques such as voice conversion, replay attacks, and text-to-speech (TTS) to manipulate or impersonate individuals. Both spectral and temporal features were extracted from the audio recordings for feature extraction. This paper explores state-of-the-art detection frameworks for deepfake audio, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced deep learning (DL) frameworks. Specifically, the performance of the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), a residual CNN integrated with an attention mechanism and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ResCNN-Attention-BGRU), WIREnet (a variant of BLSTM), the residual network for fully connected (ResNet FC), and a squeeze-and-excitation-enhanced one-dimensional CNN (SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN) were compared. The proposed models achieved notable testing accuracies, with SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN reaching the highest at 97.64%, followed by ResNet FC (97.46%) and WIREnet (97.20%), demonstrating strong generalization across the evaluated architectures. Furthermore, we experimented with different numbers of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), specifically 13, 26, and 39, in combination with other spectral and temporal features. The experimental results demonstrated that MFCC-39, together with spectral and temporal features, had a robust feature representation and achieved the best performance for deepfake detection.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition has become a vital tool in security, authentication and surveillance due to its abilities to perform at a distance and without the subject’s awareness, unlike traditional biometrics such as facial, iris or fingerprint recognition. In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique utilizing multi-level Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that addresses two main challenges: shot walks and viewpoint issues. Human skeletal structures and movements are represented in the form of multi-level graphs. The proposed technique uses both frame-level graphs (postures) and subwalk-level (quick movements) as gait features to capture relationships among the entire body and characteristic of quick movements. The stochastic process and skip connections withinGNNframework are employed to enhance flexibility, increase robustness, prevent overfitting and improve gradient flow. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 2-second walks, where each sequence contains only 40 frames, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on very short walk sequences. The proposed technique outperforms existing techniques on both top-k accuracy test and the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) Curves. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves 85.54% on the top-1 accuracy test and surpass 95% accuracy in ranks below 10. These results suggest that unique posture and quick movement are sufficient to identify a person. The strong performance of the proposed technique on dataset that contains short walking sequences and viewpoint variations demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications in security, surveillance and authentication where accurate identification from limited gait data obtained from various observation angles is crucial.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles, intelligent regenerative braking systems (IRBS) have emerged as an effective solution for energy-efficient car-following control. However, current IRBS implementations lack personalization and require drivers to select fixed braking levels, often causing discomfort by failing to reflect individual preferences. Existing personalization techniques rely on deep learning or offline-trained models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). To address these limitations, this study proposes a computationally efficient parameter adaptation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), enabling real-time personalized car-following control in IRBS. The proposed method adopts a dynamic relative speed (DRS) spacing policy to capture individual driving characteristics. A reference data generator generates real-time reference data during specific driver interventions, allowing the EKF algorithm to adapt control parameters accordingly. Simulation tests using a driver model demonstrated a significant reduction in driver interventions and maintained inter-vehicle distances aligned with the driver’s preferred distance. Vehicle tests further confirmed the algorithm’s real-time performance and low computational load, affirming its suitability for large-scale production. This study presents a practical and scalable method for personalizing IRBS-based car-following control without complex learning architectures, thereby enhancing driving comfort and expanding applicability to ADAS technologies such as adaptive cruise control (ACC).},

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the emergence of virtual humans, which play an important role in live streaming. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews of viewers’ attitudes towards virtual streamers. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, obtaining 40 papers on viewers’ attitudes towards virtual streamers from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, IEEE, and EBSCO Business Source Complete. Our results indicate that research on virtual streamers has shown an increasing trend. This topic has multidisciplinary theoretical foundations and is suitable for multiple qualitative and quantitative methods. Various attitudes towards virtual streamers were studied as dependent variables in the included studies. The most frequently investigated attitude is the purchasing intention of products endorsed by virtual streamers because e-commerce is the most common scenario in which virtual streamers are used. The use, type, and characteristics of virtual streamers can influence these attitudes. Based on the stereotype content model (SCM), the stimulus-organism-response (SOR), the affect-behavior-cognition (ABC) attitude model, and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study established a comprehensive framework to integrate the main findings of existing research on virtual streamers and reveals the mechanisms through which the use, types, and characteristics of virtual streamers influence viewers’ attitudes.

This phenomenon is particularly acute in dynamic domains such as financial fraud detection, where adversarial behaviors constantly change. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), valued for their ability to model complex relational data, are increasingly applied in this domain; however, their inherent robustness to temporal data shifts remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the impact of natural data drift on the robustness of three foundational GNN architectures: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE). Using the large-scale and highly imbalanced IEEE-CIS dataset as a challenging case study, we constructed homogeneous transaction graphs and employed a strict temporal data splitting methodology to simulate a realistic deployment scenario. Model performance was evaluated over 50 sequential, nonoverlapping monitoring windows, using AUC-PR and F2-Score as primary metrics due to their sensitivity in imbalanced contexts. Our findings confirm that all evaluated GNNs suffer from significant performance degradation over time, with GCN and GAT showing pronounced declines. A comparative analysis revealed that GraphSAGE exhibited substantially greater robustness, maintaining more stable and resilient performance. These results highlight that architectural choice is a critical factor for GNNs deployed in dynamic environments and underscore the need to develop adaptive strategies.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and real-time animal behavior monitoring systems is crucial to support precision livestock farming. This study proposes a behavior classification system for sheep using a triaxial accelerometer and embedded machine learning models, implemented on a low-power Internet of Things (IoT) device. Accelerometer signals were filtered using a Kalman Filter and segmented with a 2-second moving average window with 50% overlap. From each window, statistical features including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and signal energy were extracted for each axis (X, Y, Z), resulting in a 15-feature vector per segment. Four classification algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost were evaluated for recognizing three sheep behaviors: standing, laying, and sleeping. Experimental results on a dataset of 6,000 labeled samples showed that Random Forest outperformed other models with an accuracy of 92.1% and an F1-score of 0.9272. The trained model was then converted and deployed on an ESP32 Mini C3 microcontroller, allowing real-time behavior classification directly on the device. Classified data was transmitted via Wi-Fi and visualized on a web dashboard with latency under 2 seconds. The system demonstrates that lightweight machine learning models can be effectively integrated into embedded platforms for autonomous animal behavior monitoring. This approach reduces the reliance on manual observation and enables scalable implementation in practical farm environments. Future enhancements include incorporating additional sensor modalities expanding behavior classes and adopting adaptive learning techniques to improve robustness in diverse and dynamic livestock settings.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion is a persistent urban challenge, and signal control strategies play a crucial role in enhancing network efficiency. Traditional max pressure-based control systems prioritize optimizing throughput based on known queue lengths but often overlook the impact of intersection delays and real-world operational constraints. This study aims to develop a decentralized max-pressure-based traffic signal control system that integrates both queue length and delay effects within the max-pressure framework by introducing a novel performance metric called queue dissipation time into the control strategy. The proposed cyclic-based max pressure algorithm relies on sample travel time data obtained from probe data sources. It considers pre-defined phase sequences to enhance real-world applicability. When evaluated in a simulation environment with a realistic 20% vehicle re-identification penetration rate, the proposed approach achieved queue and delay performance comparable to control strategies relying on complete vehicle arrival data. Furthermore, implementing dynamic cycle length led to a 23% reduction in delay compared to the fixed-cycle max pressure method, inferring the benefits of adaptive timing adjustments. By incorporating queue dissipation time and considering the constraints of real-world signal operations, the proposed control system enhances the practicality of max pressure-based traffic signal strategies. This study provides a foundation for implementing decentralized adaptive traffic signal control in urban networks, particularly in environments with limited vehicle data availability. The algorithm exhibited reliable performance across various levels of data availability, delivering comparable results under both low (20%) and high (50%) penetration rate scenarios. This consistency highlights its adaptability and operational feasibility, without requiring excessive traffic data or extensive infrastructure.},

To address this, we propose SilentWhisper, a system that achieves truly user-independent recognition of ultra-low volume (45-50dB) whispered speech using only standard microphones. By fine-tuning a pre-trained speech recognition model on a multi-user dataset, our method allows anyone to use the system immediately without per-user adaptation. We validate our user-independent claim through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation with 13 participants, which confirmed a significant reduction in the average Character Error Rate (CER) from 17.0% to 7.3% (a 57.1% improvement). Crucially, this specialized fine-tuning is also robust; the model maintains performance comparable to the powerful baseline on unseen texts, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on a 1,002-word vocabulary, our system’s strong performance represents a significant step towards a practical, private conversational interface that is accessible to all.},

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in magnetotelluric (MT) studies is the effective suppression of noise in collected data prior to investigating deep geological structures and detecting deep-seated blind ore bodies. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method for magnetotelluric signal-noise separation based on stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit. The approach involves constructing a redundant dictionary comprising wavelet packets, cosine atoms, and other basis atoms to sparsely represent segmented MT data. A Gaussian matrix is then employed to observe and sample the sparsely represented data. Subsequently, the stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is applied to suppress strong interference and accurately reconstruct useful MT signals. The method is validated using both simulated typical strong interference and measured MT data from an ore concentration area. Comparisons with matching pursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and the remote reference method demonstrate that the proposed technique offers higher computational efficiency, fewer iterations, better convergence, and more effective noise suppression. Furthermore, the calculated apparent resistivity-phase curves exhibit improved continuity and smoothness, and the quality of low-frequency MT data is significantly enhanced.},

We assume that the mode of operation of the system is not available to the controller, but only an estimate provided by a detector, so that the joint process of the Markov chain and the detector is modeled as a hidden Markov model. In this context, we propose sufficient conditions in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities for the H2, H∞, and mixed H2/H∞ control design cases. We also present an iterative approach, characterized by an LMI-based coordinate descent algorithm, which is employed to solve the proposed conditions and reduces the guaranteed cost from a feasible initial solution. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach does not require the computation of stochastic stabilizing state-feedback gains for algorithm initialization. Three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results and to demonstrate their advantages over existing methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a data-driven Random Forest (RF) framework for the joint relay–link selection and buffer management problem in buffer-aided cooperative relay networks, with the goal of minimizing outage probability. Buffer-aided relaying exploits dynamic link selection to enhance throughput and reliability, but the underlying mixed-integer optimization is computationally intractable for even moderate network sizes. We recast relay selection as a multi-class classification task by generating “true” labels via a time window-based outage minimization procedure that captures long-term buffer–channel interactions. An RF classifier learns the mapping from system state features like channel gain, buffer length, link availability to optimal link labeling. A key benefit of the proposed framework is that the computationally intensive training phase is performed offline, and the resulting RF model can, in principle, be a strong candidate for real-time applications. Extensive simulations for networks with 3 and 6 relays and buffer sizes ∈ [1, 50] demonstrate that the RF-based selector consistently achieves the lowest outage probability and outperforms the available conventional schemes especially in small-buffer networks, thereby making RF a promising tool for real-time cooperative network control.},

The proposed converter features low current and voltage ripple, reduced power losses, and minimized magnetic volume. The use of parallel switches combined with an interleaved PWM technique simplifies the design and enhances performance without requiring inductors proportional to the number of arms. Key advantages include electrolyzer voltage and current ripple frequencies six times higher than the switching frequency, as well as output capacitor current ripple frequencies also six times higher. In addition, the inductor and coupling capacitor current ripple frequencies are twice the switching frequency. This behavior enables a significant reduction in the volume and mass of passive components, thereby improving power density. The paper presents the steady-state operating principles under continuous conduction mode, design guidelines, mathematical derivations, and a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art converters. A 6-kW proof-of-concept prototype was experimentally tested with a DC bus voltage of 480 V and an electrolyzer voltage of 250 V, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 98.16%, supported by experimental results and an accompanying demonstration video.},

  abstract     = {Fault tolerance is a highly desirable feature for safety-critical electric drive applications. This paper proposes an open-circuit fault tolerant model predictive controller (FT-MPC) for asymmetrical dual three-phase (DTP) permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, which is formulated using the continuous control set (CCS) approach. As an alternative to conventional control methods, this predictive controller solves an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem to obtain the voltage references. The FT-MPC is able to operate in a reduced form under healthy operation. To enable the transition to the post-fault control mode, a fault detection and diagnosis algorithm, based on the natural coupling concept, is proposed. The control solution is implemented in an OPAL-RT OP4510 real-time digital system and is experimentally validated. Thanks to the optimisation efforts carried out during implementation, the computational burden of the proposed algorithm is kept low: the developed software requires only about 7.6%of the controller’s sampling time to compute during healthy operation (reduced form), and about 10.1% during the post-fault mode, demonstrating its potential applicability in automotive grade microcontrollers. On average, open-phase fault detection times of the order of 15 ms are achieved, allowing for a fast and smooth transition between healthy and post-fault operating modes. Finally, dynamic performance is addressed under standardised driving cycle profiles. The ability of the FT-MPC to keep the torque-producing sub-space on a circular trajectory during the fault detection stage is confirmed, thus avoiding additional undesired torque ripple.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are neural network models that integrate spatial information into time series processing, and have been successfully applied in various applications. Although these models have demonstrated strong prediction capabilities, most existing STGNN architectures require a significant memory size and long training times. Some lightweight versions of STGNNs have been proposed, but they still rely on expert-driven manual designs to improve performance, which require implicit domain-specific knowledge that varies across datasets. This design approach limits their adaptability to different application scenarios. To address this limitation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to automate the STGNN design process. However, existing NAS-based approaches prioritize prediction accuracy rather than resource efficiency. As a result, current approaches fail to provide compact model architectures or efficient training and limit their scalability. In this work, we introduce SearchLight, a novel NAS-based STGNN framework to automatically discover lightweight STGNN models while maintaining prediction performance. We set two cells for spatial and temporal operations into two distinct sets to capture spatial and temporal data features better for each cell type of the NAS method. We specialize in cell types for spatial and temporal information so that the model can better capture and combine the intrinsic features of spatial and temporal data.We employ a multi-objective search strategy that optimizes both model compactness and prediction accuracy to enable our method to discover lightweight and accurate STGNN models. Experimental results across several real-world datasets show that SearchLight reduces the model size by an average of ×103.0 and training time by an average of ×74.0, while sacrificing a small amount of prediction performance, an average of 1.6%p, compared to manually designed and existing NAS-based STGNN models.},

This study examines the current Construction Progress Monitoring (CPM) process, with a focus on the adoption of technologies for data acquisition, integration, inspection, and visualization in construction environments. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify existing studies, their findings and contributions, leading to the Construction Progress Monitoring using technologies (CPMTech) model. A case study was then performed on an active construction site to validate an instance of the proposed model, specifically for manual and controlled data acquisition processes. Additionally, a virtual environment simulation was used to validate an instance of the model for autonomous data acquisition. The results correspond to the CPMTech model and its instances validated in real and simulated scenarios. The contributions stand out for supporting computing, automation, and civil engineering professionals in integrating technologies to the CPM.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving patient privacy, making it essential for medical AI applications. However, regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD mandate “the right to be forgotten”, requiring patient data removal from trained models upon request. This has driven growing interest in Federated Unlearning (FU), but existing methods require the collaborative participation of all clients, which is often impractical and raises privacy concerns, particularly in privacy sensitive medical domain. This paper introduces Maverick++, the first collaboration-free FU framework designed specifically for medical imaging applications. Inspired by Lipschitz continuity, Maverick++ quantifies memorization through a novel model sensitivity metric and frames the unlearning task as a localized optimization problem. When an unlearning request is issued, only the target client performs local unlearning by applying a locally bounded optimization procedure. This process enables effective unlearning without requiring collaboration from other clients. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on three diverse imaging benchmarks, Colorectal Cancer Histology, Pigmented Skin Lesions, and Blood Cells, demonstrate that Maverick++ sustains classification accuracy on retain data within 1–2% of retraining from scratch, reduces accuracy on unlearn data to below 1%, and lowers the attack success rate of Membership Inference Attack (MIA) to under 10%. Furthermore, Maverick++ achieves speedups of 8×–45× over state-of-the-art baselines by eliminating the need for global client coordination. These results establish Maverick++ as a practical, efficient, and privacy-aware solution for enforcing data deletion requests for FL in medical imaging domain.

  abstract     = {The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy demands energy systems that are not only technically and economically sound but also environmentally and socially sustainable. This study proposed a novel multi-objective optimisation (MOO) framework for the design of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (GC-HRES) that explicitly integrated Job Creation (JC) as a fourth objective along with traditional technical, economic, and environmental objectives, such as Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), Cost of Energy (COE), and Renewable Energy Fraction (REF). Prior studies often treated JC as a post-optimisation metric, while this study incorporated JC into the MOO using employment technology-specific factors. Metaheuristic algorithms, Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), were applied to find the optimal number of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery banks under scenarios which excluded and included JC. The results demonstrated that including JC reshaped the Pareto front, revealed new objective compromises and led to diverse configurations. MOPSO favoured solutions with higher JC and REF at the expense of cost and reliability, while NSGA-II achieved more balanced, cost-effective and reliable solutions with competitive JC values. Additional constraint sensitivity analysis further demonstrated the influence of battery bank constraints on solution feasibility. The results highlighted that integrating JC into the optimisation framework enriched design possibilities and fostered a more inclusive transition to renewable energy with a focus on GC-HRESs. This paper provided a flexible and replicable MOO framework that sets the foundation for socially attuned GC-HRES designs that align with broader sustainability goals.},

Space-borne low-power IoTs sensors are power-hungry at highly variable rates during mission operations. The total energy reserve of the CubeSat-IoTs system is 24 hours premium resource constrained by the small satellite’s solar eclipse regime(s). With the conventional heavy and rigid silicon-based solar technology design reaching its efficiency, use cases, and application limits, perovskite photovoltaic (PPV) solar cells have emerged as a worthy alternative. PPV’s flexible and lightweight properties, cost-effective silicon panels’ efficiency-boosting capability, and comparably cheaper production cost have attracted substantial commercial and scientific interests worldwide. To eliminate this problem, we propose a hybrid multiband radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester to sustain the constellation and/or clusters of CubeSat-IoTs systems operations anytime, anywhere, and optimise power supply equipment sizing and thermal reliability evaluation. This paper presents a multi-source multimode radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester development at the conceptual design phase of a CubeSat mission. This is supported by an experimental measurement of the actual power consumption of a field programmable gates array (FPGA) device in a typical CubeSat mission’s digital design implementation. The power estimate is as close to the value obtained at the system integration phase. The results show that the FPGA device’s quiescent (static) power consumptions at 50 and 100 MHz are 78 mW and 79 mW, respectively. Hybrid adaptive beamformed massive multiple-input-multiple-output heterogeneous cellular network (mMIMO-HetNets) green energy transmission and harvesting promise to address the small form factor (size, weight, power and cost) requirements and/or constraints of future sustainable small satellite missions in the LEO. The energy efficiency savings of the proposed multimode multiband RF-PPV energy harvesting and transmission system for the METCubeSat-IoTs mission is 0.23 Gb/J. This has enabled an energy budget balance for the operational space-borne devices with a multi-source N-power mode of operation to be developed for green 5G/6G/Wi-Fi and future-generation satellite-cellular convergence ecosystem and CubeSat-IoTs missions.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous vibration isolation and energy harvesting (SVIEH) have become much attractive in suspension systems for driving safety and energy efficiency. However, vibration isolation and energy harvesting are always conflict in existing structures. In this paper, the idea of vibration absorber is introduced to address this issue from the perspective of energy transfer. Firstly, the limitation of traditional regenerative shock absorbers (RSAs) in suspensions is outlined and the underlying reason is revealed. Then a dual-plane spring is presented to support the Halbach array and form a dynamic vibration absorber. Particularly, the electromagnetic energy harvester replaces the traditional damper. By this way, a novel decoupling SVIEH (D-SVIEH) structure is proposed for suspension systems. A two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) magneto-electromechanical coupling model of the D-SVIEH system is derived and the harmonic balance method is adopted to analytically solve the dimensionless model. Next, numerical simulations are done to investigate the effects of key parameters on the force transmissibility and the average harvested power. In the end, a D-SVIEH prototype is built and experimental tests are carried out. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed D-SVIEH structure can achieve a peak output power in the vibration isolation zone, so it can effectively overcome the conflict between vibration isolation and energy harvesting. Also, the vibration isolation starting frequency of the D-SVIEH structure is less than those of linear and traditional quasi-zero stiffness-based SVIEH structures, so the D-SVIEH structure is more suitable for low-frequency vibrations than the others. The significance of this work is to provide new insights into designing RSAs in suspension systems.},

  abstract     = {A user model (UM) is a representation of the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of a user that a computer system utilizes to provide the user with personalized experiences. In educational settings, for instance, a system can use information about the Learning Styles (LSs) of a student to provide them with adequate study materials. Furthermore, with the growing use of Learning Management System (LMS) platforms, such as Moodle, continuous streams of user data highlight the need to compute student models dynamically to support adaptive decision-making in teaching and learning. This paper introduces a framework for Dynamic User Modeling (DUMING) to create evolving Dynamic User Models (DUMs) that capture and adapt to changes in student LSs over time, based on event log streams from an LMS. This framework leverages the Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) and integrates Data Stream Mining (DSM) and Process Mining (PM) techniques across three layers: collection, preprocessing, and mining. Collected event streams are processed within landmark windows and classified into High-Level Events (HLEs) based on LMS functionality. The STREAMKMeans algorithm clusters events, and the PM phase uses Alpha Miner (AM), Heuristic Miner (HM), and Inductive Miner (IM) algorithms to identify learning paths represented as Petri Nets (PNs), with IM showing the highest values in the quality metrics used. Implemented and evaluated in a course using Moodle at the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico, the framework employs IF-THEN rules to relate HLE proportions to FSLSM-based LSs, visualizing changes through radar charts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating adaptive DUMs, providing insights that enhance over time educational support and enable timely interventions.},

  abstract     = {Effective capacity planning in outpatient departments faces several challenges, particularly long patient waiting times and insufficient working time due to the increasing workload of senior doctors. Lean thinking, a methodology that improves efficiency by eliminating waste, has been widely adopted in healthcare operations. A recent approach integrated lean thinking with integer linear programming to improve capacity planning by optimizing resource allocation. Particularly, it reduces workload by transferring patients from senior to associate senior doctors. However, the existing model involves only doctors while neglecting other medical staff, and lacks a guarantee of balanced workload distribution after patient transfers. Therefore, incorporating additional medical staff and rebalancing the workload are required to reduce maximum working time and achieve a balanced workload among staff, respectively. In this paper, we propose two enhanced ILP-based lean thinking-enabled models, OCPlean1 and OCPlean2, to further improve planning efficiency and workload balance. OCPlean1 incorporates nurses into the model to reduce the maximum working time for the doctors by delegating certain examination services from associate senior doctors to nurses. In addition to that, OCPlean2 introduces an adaptive workload balancing strategy aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of workload after patient transfers. Experimental results demonstrate that OCPlean1 significantly reduces maximum workload under varying conditions, including different numbers of doctors and patients, and fluctuating diagnosis and examination times. On the other hand, OCPlean2 achieves a more balanced workload distribution. These findings contribute to more efficient and sustainable outpatient scheduling models and support better utilization of healthcare personnel.},

The new method is based on the weights assigned to each objective, which are used to calculate a reference point. The solution chosen by the algorithm is the solution that has the shortest distance from the reference point. The algorithm is able to explore the whole Pareto Front in both its concave and convex parts, but it has a flaw, which is that it is highly impacted by the range of values of the objectives. This limitation of the algorithm can be solved by normalizing the Pareto Front, so that the values for all of the criteria are numbers from 0 to 1, or by using the cosine similarity to measure the distance of the solutions from the reference point. Simulations show that after implementing one of the two methods that make the algorithm independent of the range of the values of the objectives, it performs well by choosing solutions with an optimal distribution throughout the whole Pareto Front.},

However, while many studies on UAV-assisted MEC systems focus on optimizing factors such as delay and energy consumption, fewer consider user satisfaction, which is an important determinant of overall system efficiency. This paper aims to address this gap. Specifically, we first develop a novel user satisfaction model by jointly considering processing delay, desired delay, marginal delay, delay sensitivity, and time sensitivity of the tasks. Then, we formulate an optimization problem that considers both computational resource allocation and task offloading decisions to maximize total user satisfaction while minimizing total energy consumption. Finally, a SAC-based US (User Satisfaction)-oriented Task Offloading (SAC-USTO) algorithm is proposed to address the task offloading problem, and a Task Size-based Resource Allocation (TS-RA) algorithm is introduced to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other baseline methods.},

To meet this objective, the researchers prepared three annotated real-world datasets consisting of tomato leaf images, including samples with simple and complex backgrounds, and young plants aged two to four weeks. A transformer-based deep learning model, ‘Tomato TransDeepLab’, is proposed for accurately segmenting multiple and minute disease lesions on a single leaf. The model demonstrates high segmentation precision even with complex backgrounds and indistinct lesion boundaries. It achieves a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.09% and accuracy of 98.17%. It also recorded the lowest training time of 989 minutes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, ResUNet, DeepLabV3, and Tuned DeepLabV3+ across all three datasets confirms its superior performance. Furthermore, the model is employed to assess disease severity and estimate crop loss using a severity scale designed by plant pathologists. This scale links lesion area to severity level and crop loss. Results indicate a crop loss between 1 to 5% for Datasets 1 and 2. The proposed approach offers an automated solution for disease segmentation, severity assessment, and crop loss estimation in tomato crops.},

This protocol, known as the Distance-Aware Bit-Mapping based Energy-Efficient MAC, uses bit-mapping to achieve energy-efficient network communication. It differentiates between critical and normal nodes, prioritizes time-sensitive data transmission, and incorporates a security mechanism at the application layer to adjust transmission power based on the distance of end nodes from the gateways. A probability-based end-node arrangement approach is used to study the impact of distance-based transmission power tuning on total energy consumption.

Although ultrasonic guided waves can effectively inspect pipelines, the complex geometry of pipe bends poses distinct challenges to their propagation. This study rigorously examined guided-wave testing methods for pipe bends in marine pipelines. The semi-analytical finite element method was initially used to compute the dispersion curves and mode structures of the guided waves for a typical marine pipeline. Mode structure analysis at the pipe bends identified the torsional T(0,1) mode, focusing on the extrados. Finite element simulations then characterized the T(0,1) mode scattering at the pipe bends. Using the trigonometric circumferential distribution of guided wave modes, signals for specific circumferential orders were extracted from the simulated data to elucidate the modal composition and propagation paths of the primary T(0,1) scattered signals. This establishes a theoretical framework for interpreting guided wave signals in pipe-bend inspections. Experiments confirmed the heightened sensitivity of the T(0,1) mode to extrados defects, validating theoretical mode structure analyses.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of adolescents suffering from anxiety highlights the need for Anxiety Detection systems. Although there are some conventional systems based on face modality, there is a compelling need for an end-to-end framework with a focus on early detection of anxiety. Although some works have presented deep learning-based multichannel approaches, they lack investigation of the impact of channels on model performance. Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013.

This paper examines the interpretability of deep learning-based classification models using two prominent Explainable AI techniques: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet-50 model on the EuroSAT dataset, we analyzed twenty representative satellite image samples, comprising both correctly and incorrectly classified instances across ten land use classes. Grad-CAM generated class-discriminative spatial attention maps that identified salient regions influencing the model’s predictions, while LIME provided super pixel-based visual explanations reflecting localized feature contributions. Comparative analysis of both techniques revealed consistent patterns of model attention and exposed spectral and spatial ambiguities that underlie misclassification. These insights not only enhance the interpretability of CNN-based remote sensing models but also inform the development of more transparent and reliable Earth observation systems.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling specifically designed for real-time workloads by integrating hybrid laxity-priority scheduling to manage aperiodic tasks with varying priorities. The design includes limiting preemption overhead by blocking unnecessary preemptions and dynamically adapting to incoming sensor data. We extend our algorithm by taking environmental conditions into account, where the weight of laxity and priorities can change based on the circumstances. This also includes the effect of external conditions, namely weather conditions on the priority of tasks. The scheduler is designed for systems such as ADAS, where tasks have different priorities, but are not necessarily dependent on each other. Aperiodic tasks are harder to schedule due to the many unpredictable factors that make up the task. Focusing on aperiodic tasks, the proposed multi-core task scheduler design handles sensor-triggered events and adapts scheduling dynamically by prioritizing running tasks by blocking unnecessary preemption. Experimental results using software-based validation demonstrate improved deadline adherence, affirming the performance of the proposed scheduler compared to classical and real-time schedulers. This study evaluates the scheduler's performance based on key metrics including deadline misses, preempting, makespan, and the proportion of high-priority deadline misses relative to total deadline misses. Our proposed algorithm demonstrated a miss rate 6% lower than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for similar tasksets.},

Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.},

  abstract     = {The Hybrid Modular Multilevel Converter (HMMC) topology—comprising full-bridge (FB) and half-bridge (HB) submodules—is effective for DC fault clearance in HVDC systems. However, to prevent overvoltage in lower-arm full-bridge submodules (FBSMs) during valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault mitigation—an uncommon yet critical internal fault in bipolar HVDC systems—the proportion of FBSMs used must account for approximately 86.6% of the arm voltage, compared to 43.3% for DC-side fault blocking. This diminishes the economic advantage of HMMC over fully full-bridge MMC topology. This paper proposes an HMMC SPG fault mitigation method using thyristor-based current commutation branches on the lower arms and a ground-side mechanical interrupter, while maintaining the minimum number of FBSMs required for conventional DC fault clearance. The method mitigates SPG-resultant lower-arm overvoltage by commutating current into the thyristor branches, after which the mechanical interrupter clear lower arms current, and subsequently thyristor branches are turned-off to clear the SPG-valve side fault. Additionally, the pole current is cleared using a mechanical breaker or passive oscillation DC circuit breaker (CB), effectively suppressing upper-arm submodule (SM) overvoltage under SPG valve-side fault in both short- and long-distance HMMC bipolar links. Although additional equipment is required, it incurs no on-state losses during steady-state operation. The proposed method is compared with existing SPG fault clearance approaches for HMMC bipolar systems. Its effectiveness is validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and benchmarked against prior SPG fault clearance methods for HMMC systems.},

The microcontroller’s ADC converts analog joystick signals into digital values, which are processed using linear scaling algorithms to derive motion (Azimuth) and angle (Elevation) measurements. These measurements are averaged for noise reduction and then transmitted via the CAN bus in structured byte-array packets. Implementation involves initializing system control, GPIO, ADC, CAN, and timer peripherals. The ADC continuously samples signals and stores them in lookup tables; converted values are packaged using pre-configured CAN mailboxes and sent at regular intervals using a timer-based ISR. Additionally, the system integrates a secondary CAN node (Arduino) to demonstrate multi-node communication. Visualization and validation are achieved through an Integrated Guidance and Control Display Unit (IGCDU) and a CAN Bus Analyzer. The authors have developed and implemented the complete embedded system architecture, including real-time signal acquisition routines, ADC-to-angle conversion algorithms, multi-node CAN communication logic, and visualization through IGCDU. This integration enables synchronized, real-time data capture, monitoring, and fault-tolerant transmission, making it ideal for embedded defense system applications.},

This paper presents a predictive asset management framework based on machine learning (ML) to assess the fault vulnerability of pipes. To train the ML algorithm, a combined dataset of both geospatial and operational data is implemented. While pressure is often estimated using complex hydraulic simulations, this study proposes and evaluates a lightweight linear pressure approximation method based on expert knowledge. The ML model is applied to a real DHN in Denmark through collaboration with the utility company HOFOR. Due to a significant class imbalance in the data (∼1:215), multiple oversampling (OS) strategies are investigated. Model performance is evaluated using fault capture versus length capture (FCLC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The inclusion of pressure data is found to improve the AUC by 4.5%, and the model captures over 40% of failures by inspecting only 10% of the network. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using ML-based fault vulnerability prediction as a tool for predictive maintenance and asset replacement planning in DHNs.},

  abstract     = {Power system stability continues to be a major challenge as modern grids grow more complex, uncertain, and increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. This paper presents two new Neuro-Fuzzy controllers for Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs): the Direct Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (DNF-CW), which adapts parameters online using fixed-structure rules, and the Indirect Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (IDNF-CW), which uses an online identifier to measure plant sensitivity. Chebyshev wavelet-based neural networks are utilized in the consequent part of both controllers to enable accurate local modeling and improved damping performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system and the IEEE 9-bus multi-machine system under a variety of fault and loading conditions. Benchmark comparisons include a conventional Indirect Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (IDNF-TSK) based controller, a configuration without STATCOM (No STATCOM), and a configuration with STATCOM but without auxiliary control (No Control). In the SMIB scenario, the IDNF-CW achieves a 40% reduction in settling time compared to the IDNF-TSK. In the more demanding multi-machine setup, the IDNF-CW restores stability within 3 seconds after a sequence of faults, outperforming DNF-CW and IDNF-TSK. Additionally, reductions of over 53% in the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) and 36% in the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) are observed. These tests under multiple fault conditions and 10% measurement noise confirm stable operation, with overshoot limited to 3.57%–4.7% and minimal impact on settling time. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining Chebyshev wavelets, adaptive control, and indirect architectures for enhancing power system stability.},

  abstract     = {Traditional finite control set model predictive control for single-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped inverters suffers from three main issues: non-constant switching frequency, high harmonic distortion, and neutral-point voltage fluctuations. In order to overcome these traditional problems, this paper explores the predictive control strategy of a three-vector model with fixed switching frequency. Taking the output voltage vector as the finite set, the objective function is reasonably constructed by optimizing the region division and vector synthesis, and finally the constant switching frequency and efficient harmonic suppression are realized under the condition of fast neutral point potential equilibrium. In view of the delay effect in predictive control, this paper proposes a two-step prediction delay compensation, which can effectively hedge the calculation delay and improve the control accuracy and dynamic response. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to conventional finite control set model predictive control under a 10 kHz sampling frequency, the proposed method reduces the total harmonic distortion of the output current from 7.5% to 1.8%, stabilizes the switching frequency at 1.2 kHz, achieves neutral-point voltage balance, and realizes simultaneous optimization of steady-state accuracy and dynamic performance. This approach resolves the trade-off between dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy, offering a robust solution for energy integration applications under complex operating conditions.},

Machine vision technology plays a crucial role in scrap metal recycling, where accurate identification of waste metals has consistently been a key focus in this field. To address issues such as missed detections, false positives, and low detection accuracy caused by complex backgrounds in copper and aluminium scrap detection, along with the need for lightweight deployment, an improved YOLOv11n-based detection model for copper and aluminium scraps is proposed. The C3k2_Star_CAA module was designed to replace the original C3K2 module, improving feature extraction and target recognition in complex environments. The FPNSC module was introduced in place of the original SPPF module to capture finer features while keeping the model lightweight. A Feature Focus Diffusion Pyramid Network (FDPN) was adopted to substitute the original feature pyramid network, enhancing multi-scale feature fusion through FocusFeature modules and a diffusion mechanism. Additionally, a Dynamic Detection Head (DyHead) was incorporated to replace the original detection head, integrating multi-scale features to improve detection accuracy for objects of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved model achieved a 9% increase in mAP@0.5, a 6.5% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95, along with 3.9% higher Precision, 12.4% better Recall, and 8.2% greater F1-Score on the dataset, while also showing significant improvements in both parameter count and detection speed, making it more suitable for copper and aluminium scrap detection tasks. Furthermore, generalisation experiments using public datasets confirmed that the model exhibits strong generalisation capabilities.},

Multiple cold plate configurations were evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, focusing on junction temperature, thermal uniformity, and pressure drop.

Setting these thresholds too high results in too few itemsets, while setting them too low leads to excessive itemsets and high computational cost. To address these issues, we developed solutions for mining Top-K high-utility itemsets from uncertain databases. First, we formulate the problem of mining Top-K high-utility itemsets from uncertain databases. Based on the problem statement, we propose four algorithms: FTKHUUIM+, ITUHUFP, TUHUFP, and TKUU to meet the requirements effectively. These algorithms utilize automated threshold-raising strategies and specialized storage structures to ensure optimal performance. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show scalability and robust performance across both dense and sparse datasets of the algorithms in terms of runtime and efficiency. They all share the common feature of pruning candidate itemsets based on dynamic minimum probabilistic support and utility thresholds. Although their pruning strategies differ, all algorithms follow a recursive process to select Top-K HUIs by pairing items from the database and filtering patterns based on the thresholds. Among the proposed algorithms, the ITUHUFP algorithm demonstrates the best performance and stability in various benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.},

In low-rank analysis, the problem of regularizing the nuclear norm, defined as the sum of singular values, is typically solved by iteratively applying singular value thresholding. However, this process often requires a long run-time due to the computational cost of singular value decomposition. To address this issue, we provide a method that is computationally inexpensive and can be executed in parallel. The core of our approach lies in the discovery of geometric properties of the nuclear norm, leading to a computational process that is fundamentally different from conventional methods. Our method is fast because it does not require singular value decomposition, which has been a bottleneck in terms of computational complexity and parallelism. We design the computation method for two-column matrices as the main proposal, and also demonstrate an optional method for approximately solving the three-column matrices problem. Through experiments, the proposed method calculated singular value thresholding up to 65.81 times faster with higher calculation accuracy than conventional methods.We also applied our method to real data for noise removal in 3D models and confirmed the improvement in computational speed.},

  abstract     = {The growing importance of thermal imaging in a variety of fields, including medical diagnostics, security, and environmental monitoring, emphasizes the critical need for efficient deep learning models capable of analysing thermal data. The training of these algorithms is much limited by the absence of suitably annotated thermal imaging datasets. We propose LiquidGAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture which integrates the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) to address the scarcity of annotated thermal imaging datasets. LiquidGAN employs a fixed-step Runge-Kutta solver to refine the latent representations, enabling continuous image transformations through an encoder-ODE-decoder generator. The LNN-based discriminator adaptively models the subtle and the dynamic temperature features, hence improving the ability to distinguish the real images from synthetic images. By integrating ODE-driven liquid dynamics across both generator and the discriminator, LiquidGAN effectively captures the dynamic temperature variations while stabilizing adversarial training under the limited data conditions. Moreover, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and the gradient scaling is used in our work to further improve the computational efficiency. Experimental results on multiple thermal imaging datasets, including those related to surveillance, healthcare, and precision agriculture, suggest that LiquidGAN offers a promising direction for generating high-fidelity synthetic thermal images under data-constrained conditions.},

  abstract     = {Precision irrigation necessitates decision support systems that are both efficient and comprehensible to farmers and agronomists. Numerous current solutions depend on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks or black-box artificial intelligence (AI) models, which frequently encounter challenges related to interoperability, transparency, and reproducibility. To overcome these constraints, this research developed an ontology-driven expert system that formalizes knowledge of crops, soil, and climate into a modular framework capable of generating explicable irrigation recommendations. The system was developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and augmented with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, employing a hybrid development methodology that integrates the structured precision of the V-cycle with the data-driven focus of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and the semantic precision of the NeOn (Networked Ontologies) methodology. Competency questions guided the development of numerous agricultural concepts pertaining to irrigation. Scenario-based assessments validated that the ontology accurately deduced crop coefficient (Kc), integrated AI-predicted ET0 with sensor-derived assertions, and produced consistent irrigation or non-irrigation recommendations across diverse situations. All reasoning processes performed in under one second, showcasing computational efficiency. Thus, the research provides a replicable and adaptable foundation for ontology-based irrigation decision support, facilitating future implementation using real-time sensor data and field validation.},

PassStyles authenticates users who successfully select one correct image from nine generated images multiple times in a row. The benefit of PassStyles is that the user can authenticate intuitively by choosing an image from nine images. The other benefit is its robustness to shoulder surfing because the different images generated by StyleGAN and the three-by-three combination of those images make it difficult for non-genuine users to identify the password. Moreover, PassStyles has a registration scheme that specifies which layers of StyleGAN contain the password in order to generate a wide variety of images for authentication from a few images. In addition, it uses password distilling, which removes inappropriate authentication images, to mitigate authentication errors that occur when the generated images do not adequately match the password. The evaluation experiments indicated that various image features can be passwords. In addition, we conducted shoulder surfing experiments on PassStyles and achieved a protection rate of over 90% for some passwords.},

However, dealing with highly complex, possibly nonlinear, and noisy systems remains an open problem. In recent years, the use of data-driven techniques based on machine learning for system identification has represented a promising solution for addressing the challenges of complex system identification. Among these methods, auto-encoders have been successfully applied to compactly represent the system state in a latent space used for estimating the system dynamics. In this work, we propose leveraging the ensemble paradigm for system identification, and in particular to exploit an ensemble of autoencoders, to reduce the uncertainty compared to individual autoencoders. To this end, we propose an algorithm for selecting autoencoders based on a combination of an accuracy metric and a diversity index.We validated this approach using traditional benchmarks in the field of nonlinear system identification.},

  abstract     = {Arc melting pools are generated when the pantograph and catenary (PAC) are offline during the rise and fall of the pantograph. They can lead to the material damage, accelerated wear, increased splashing, and exacerbated PAC fatigue through the thermal cycling, shortening its service life. In this paper, the voltage and current are measured by a high-speed PAC experimental platform when the PAC occur the offline discharge. And the arc erosion images are obtained using a scanning electron microscope. Based on the principle of the magnetohydrodynamics, a simulation model of the PAC arc is established and its correctness is verified by comparing the experimental data. The distribution of the heat flow input density of the arc is obtained by adopting the moving mesh technique and coupling the actual auto-transformer (AT) traction grid circuit. Meanwhile, the melting solidification model and evaporation sublimation model are introduced to study the behavior of the material erosion by the arc when the pantograph rises and lowers. When the PAC offline discharge occurs during the rise of the pantograph, the heat flow density is concentrated and the temperatures of the contact line and pantograph are 3550 K and 4290 K, respectively. The melting pool is of a deep and narrow type. Its depth is 1.71 mm, which is 80% more than that during the fall of the pantograph. While its width decreases by 17.48% compared with that during the fall of the pantograph, which increases the risk of the localized overheating and thermal stresses. As the pantograph falls, the density of the heat flow decreases and the temperature of the contact point is lowered. The melting pool is shallow and wide, making it more susceptible to splashing and accelerating the wear. The increased temperature in the melting pool triggers the Marangoni effect, which leads to the eddy currents. They increase the instability and spattering on the surface of the pantograph, accelerating the material damage. The innovation of this paper lies in the integration of the arc model, erosion model, and AT traction circuits, and the introduction of the Marangoni force, evaporation-sublimation behaviors, and moving mesh technology, to systematically study the PAC erosion behaviors during the rise and fall of the pantograph. Its purpose is to provide theoretical support for the selection of the PAC materials, their structural design, and preventive maintenance.},

During continual pretraining, the framework integrates domain-specific word boundaries as implicit structural signals, reconstructing the semantic distribution of pre-trained models using only 1/100,000 of high-quality domain-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAdapt achieves an average F1-score improvement of 1.52% on social media and emergency entity recognition tasks when applied to general pre-trained models. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms full-parameter fine-tuning in training efficiency, offering a resource-efficient paradigm for domain-specific semantic adaptation.},

A 30 kW, 700 VDC, two-level, three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs is developed to operate at a 2 kHz fundamental and 40 kHz switching frequency. Unlike conventional inverters operating at 50–60 Hz, this design supports high-speed motors (above 100,000 rpm) by increasing the fundamental frequency to 2 kHz. A detailed comparison between two-level and three-level T-type topologies is conducted, with the selected topology maintaining over 99% efficiency across a wide frequency range. The design incorporates detailed loss modelling, a low-inductance PCB layout, and optimized DC-link capacitor selection to ensure robust high-frequency operation. The influence of modulation index and switching frequency ratio on inverter efficiency and current total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed, highlighting their impact on thermal performance and current quality. Thermal simulations using PLECS estimate a peak efficiency of 99.3%. The design is validated through simulation and experimental testing on a 30 kW prototype, achieving 14.3 kW/L power density and 25 kW/kg gravimetric density. Comparative analysis with recent literature confirms the proposed inverter's advantages in power density, efficiency, and high-frequency capability.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities and their associated applications integrate various cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and edge computing (EC). ML-driven services within smart cities are often computationally intensive and time-sensitive. While EC serves as a complementary infrastructure to traditional cloud-end users architecture, enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) for end users, the advent of ML-dependent services necessitates a redefinition of QoS to incorporate relevant ML performance metrics. On the other side, the limited computational capabilities of EC servers make such QoS metrics conflicting. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between system cost for running ML models and ML model performance. In this article, we present an effective offloading scheme designed for a three-layer cloud–edge–users system, aiming to optimize the performance-QoS tradeoff in the long run, especially for ML-dependent services, considering the dynamic of the system. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques, we transform the offloading problem from a long-term perspective into a frame-based problem. Recognizing that the new per-frame problem is NP-hard, we introduce a tabu search-based algorithm, termed TSMALE, to address this challenge. Analytically, we demonstrate that our proposed TSMALE algorithm achieves an approximate solution of roughly 0.923 compared to the optimal solution.},

The entire IPS comprises multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each exchanging information with interconnected subsystems through the communication network. Local DMPC controllers are designed with robust constraints and load reference set-point constraints, where robust constraints limit the impact of tie-line power deviations and disturbances. To further alleviate the computational and communication burdens of subsystems, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed, in which the threshold integrates the information of current subsystem state, disturbances, and tie-line power deviations between areas. By comparing this threshold with the deviation between the actual trajectory and the optimal prediction, the instants of optimization problem solving and information transmission are determined, effectively balancing control performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the theoretical conditions guaranteeing Zeno-free behavior, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation results and analysis for a three-area IPS demonstrate that computational and communication burdens are significantly reduced while achieving a satisfactory LFC objective, which validates the effectiveness of the ET-DMPC strategy.},

The accelerator architecture and properties it exposes to the higher-level programming model play a key role in determining the programming model and economic viability of the accelerators. We compare two classes of AI/ML accelerator architectures: an efficient loosely coupled accelerator already implemented in silicon and a tightly coupled accelerator with a traditional and user-friendly programming model. Our comparison shows that the performance of the design depends on the amount of hardware resources and not on how they are integrated, concluding that it is possible to architect accelerators in a much simpler and more compiler-friendly manner, while still maintaining the benefits of offload computing.},

In this article, we present Aura, an inaircraft flight maneuver training system that provides real-time performance feedback to pilots. Aura consists of sequential flight data capture, flight data analysis, and flight data visualization modules. The flight data capture module uses a pipeline of computer vision techniques and object detection algorithms to collect flight data optically. The flight data analysis module applies a transformer-based classifier network, trained on a custom dataset, to identify flight maneuvers in real-time. The flight data visualization module displays processed data to pilots on a hardware display in a task-specific layout. Aura does not need a physical interface with aircraft avionics, thereby circumventing data access issues in military aircraft. Aura is ground tested using UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter flight simulator recordings and is flight tested for several hours in a Cessna 172S G1000 to validate effectiveness.},

To that end, we present the world’s first robotic circulating nurse (RCN), a novel mobile robotic assistance system, which aims to support clinicians during surgical interventions by autonomously executing tasks within nonsterile areas of the operating room (OR) environment. A core use case of the RCN is the collection, opening, and handing over of sterilely packaged surgical materials, for which we describe our approach to robotic design and behavior implementation. Technical evaluation tests show that our RCN prototype reliably handles the end-to-end workflow for providing requested materials to the surgical team. The practical feasibility and user acceptance of the approach were confirmed during a user study conducted with the OR nursing team at a German university hospital. As a main focus of this article, the hygienic robotic handover of surgical materials was evaluated, yielding an overall success rate of 98.71%. While the execution speed is still in need of improvement, our RCN received highly favorable ratings with regard to relevance, usability, reliability, and hygiene. This underlines the high potential of the RCN concept for addressing the staff shortage problem and for upholding today’s high standard of surgical patient care.},

Due to the deployment of these devices at the edge outside of a trusted computing base, there is a potential for various eavesdropping and tampering attacks. This can have a severe impact on the privacy and integrity of sensor data, which cannot be corrected for through the secure design of other blocks that follow the front end.

  abstract     = {Recent research on epidemic processes has revealed the limitations of traditional networks, which capture only pairwise relationships, to characterize complex multiparty relationships and group influences properly. Epidemic processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and the endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of higher-order interactions. Novel sufficient conditions for different system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, after establishing the local stability of the equilibrium, an explicit domain of attraction linked to the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we validate the approximation efficacy of the mean-field SIS contagion processes compared with the $2^{n}$-state Markov chain models. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS contagion processes.},

Existing power allocating controllers have been developed to achieve SoC balancing without taking balancing speed into consideration. Motivated by this observation, we aim to design new power allocating controllers such that accelerated SoC balancing is achieved. To facilitate our control design, we first introduce a new concept, the powered SoC, and establish new sufficient conditions that guarantee SoC balancing among battery units in the discharging and the charging modes. Based on these new sufficient conditions, we design a power allocating controller for each battery unit. It is shown that the proposed power allocating controllers achieve accelerated SoC balancing while delivering the desired total power. One key merit of our control method lies in achieving faster SoC balancing by tuning the power in the powered SoC. Moreover, we provide in-depth discussions on the SoC evolution trends among the battery units, the limiting case, and the parameter choice. Simulation results are given to validate our analytical results.},

This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.},

In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for $k$-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Building on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce $k$-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a method called Multiplayer Cascaded Policy Iteration (MCPI) for finding Nash equilibrium solutions to non-zero-sum (NZS) differential games. While policy iteration (PI) methods have existed for NZS game problems, they usually return solutions lacking stability guarantees during the iterative process due to using a parallel structure in solution-seeking. To tackle such a stability issue, we now propose MCPI with an essentially different structure in series, which is proven to not only guarantee the stability of the iterative process but also exhibit equivalence to quasi-Newton iteration. Based on MCPI, we further develop a state-feedback algorithm to achieve a data-driven solution for multiplayer NZS games, which does not necessitate knowledge of the system dynamics, relying instead on input and state data to learn Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, by leveraging a homotopic method, we provide a path to address a long-standing challenge in PI-based NZS games with completely unknown dynamics, namely, the model demand for an initial stabilizing control policy, which, however, is required in the existing PI-based NZS works. In addition, we broaden the application of the state-feedback algorithm by introducing an output-feedback MCPI algorithm, which alleviates the necessity for full-dimensional measurement of system states. The output-feedback approach deduces optimal solutions for multiplayer NZS game problems and is characterized by its model-free nature, as it leverages input-output data to operate independently of specific knowledge about system dynamics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of these two model-free algorithms through case studies involving a numerical example and a multi-actuated mechanical rotating rigid body.},

By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either 1 or $+\infty$ to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel distributed scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameter, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no “centralized” aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.},

It proposes a procedure to reduce the stabilization problem for an augmented system (the plant plus internal model) to an equivalent one based on a process without the internal model and having the complexity of the plant. A key idea is to introduce stable compensation of internal model (CIM) elements to the controller, which are, in a sense, dual to the dead-time compensators used in the control of delay systems. Closed-form state-space expressions for such CIM elements and the resulting equivalent plant are derived for both finite-dimensional and repetitive internal models. The complexity of the design of stabilizers is then substantially lower than in approaches based on system augmentation.},

The policy computed via parallel MPC applies the first control of the lookahead minimization with the lowest cost. We show that the proposed method can harnesses the power of multiple computing units. Moreover, we prove that the policy computed via parallel MPC has better performance guarantee than that computed via the single lookahead minimization involved in parallel MPC.},

We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its privacy-preserving properties regarding the system's initial state. Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input Gaussian noise.},

Typical CBF safety filter designs assume that the system has a uniform relative degree. This assumption is restrictive and is frequently overlooked in practice. When violated, the assumption can cause the safety filter to become inactive, allowing large and possibly unsafe control inputs to be applied to the system. In discrete-time implementations, the inactivity issue is often manifested as chattering close to the safety boundary and/or constraint violations. In this work, we provide an in-depth discussion on the safety filter inactivity issue, propose a mitigation strategy based on multiple CBFs, and derive an upper bound on the sampling time for safety under sampled-data control.

  abstract     = {Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested. They replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. Such hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge, such as first principles, and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for planning of experiments and generating data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations, which are easier to solve and yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the issue of smooth control of continuous-time switched linear systems. The dual-mode-dependent stabilizing controller is employed instead of the mode-dependent controller used in the existing smooth control results, such that the control freedom is increased and the admissible dual-modal average dwell time switching is generated to enhance the switching frequency of mode-dependent or admissible edge-dependent average dwell-time switching. To eliminate the control input bumps caused by switching controllers, a new dual-mode-transition-dependent smooth control method is proposed by using the time-interpolated controller operating across the front and back subsystems. Unlike existing smooth control methods, the operation of pre-designed controller gain is avoided and the problem of system instability during the transition stage is greatly mitigated or overcome by the proposed method, such that the control performance and the admissible switching frequency are significantly improved. Two examples are presented to illustrate the benefits of the obtained theoretical results.},

However, this requirement can be overly restrictive in practical implementations. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel online RL algorithm for approximating the Nash equilibrium solutions in discrete-time multiplayer nonzero-sum games under a relaxed initial excitation condition, thereby avoiding the need for the PE assumption. Different from existing methods that rely on data storage mechanisms and full-rank conditions, the proposed algorithm incorporates an online verification scheme that evaluates the positivity properties of an augmented matrix. This mechanism ensures initial excitation without requiring heuristic data collection designed to satisfy the PE condition. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis to establish the convergence of the designed algorithm. Finally, comparative studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

To obtain a reliable interval estimation, a novel interval estimation method is proposed by combining a robust observer gain design approach with an interval analysis method. Firstly, a robust observer synthesis approach is adopted to compute an observer gain to improve the accuracy of the point-wise estimation when the discrete measurements are available. In the case of aperiodic discrete-time measurements, a polytopic model with an additive norm-bounded term is proposed to characterize the uncertainties induced by the time-varying character of the inter-measurement interval times. Then, to cope with these uncertainties, a robust observer design method is introduced. Based on the obtained point-wise estimation, an interval estimation is achieved via an interval-based explicit reachability method. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method relies on non-restrictive assumptions and provides high estimation performance. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

A learner can sequentially observe the equilibria reached by the game system as the observable signal changes, and its goal is to identify the unknown parameters in the cost functions. We recast this problem as an online optimization and introduce a novel online parameter identification algorithm. To be specific, we construct a regularized loss function that balances between conservativeness and correctiveness, where the conservativeness term ensures that the renewed estimates do not deviate significantly from the current estimates, while the correctiveness term is captured by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the generalized Nash equilibrium. For which, the balance is adjusted by a learning rate parameter. We then prove that when the players' cost functions are linear with respect to the unknown parameters and the learning rate satisfies μk ∝ 1/ √ k, along with other assumptions, the regret bound of the proposed algorithm is O(√ K) (k and K represent the current round of online algorithm and the total rounds of games played, respectively). Finally, we conduct numerical simulations on the parameter identification of a Nash-Cournot problem to demonstrate that the performance of our proposed online algorithm is comparable to that of the offline setting.},

First, a novel universal constraint approach is introduced, which combines a universal composite barrier function (UCBF) that depends on the tracking error and the output, with universal barrier functions (UBFs) that depend on the remaining states. Compared with existing research, it displays the following appealing features: 1) both tracking error constraints and full-state constraints are ensured simultaneously without encountering the “feasibility conditions”. The constraints on the tracking error and the output are decoupled, and the constraining functions on both the tracking error and full states, especially including the output, can be directly determined by the user. 2) the proposed approach provides a universal solution that can handle both constrained and unconstrained cases uniformly without changing the control structure. Then, through a new coordinate transformation, the nonlinear system subject to the two constraints is converted into an equivalent “unconstrained” system. Further, by designing a modified filter and utilizing the adaptive backstepping design, an adaptive dynamic surface asymptotic controller is proposed to stabilize the “unconstrained” system. It is theoretically proved that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically without “explosion of complexity”, and the features of the universal constraint approach are achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control is also illustrated by simulation verification.},

The objective is to develop a supervisor synthesis algorithm such that the controlled system is enforced to be weighted opaque, that is, no weighted observation can lead to the exposure of specified states. First, we propose the tree of unobservable reach to synthesize the minimal full set of control patterns that covers all possible unobservable reach for the given state. Then, we propose a new structure named weighted all-inclusive controller (W-AIC), which shows all possible reachable states according to different control patterns and presents the reachable states under certain observations. Finally, based on our proposed structure, we can discover all states in which the secrets will be inevitably revealed. By removing these states and making the W-AIC consistent, the maximally permissive supervisors that enforce the non-opaque system to generate secret-preserving languages can be synthesized. It is proved that by employing W-AICs, the enforcement weighted opacity problem can be solved when the accumulated transition costs of successive observations are lower than the user-defined cutoff weight.},

  abstract     = {In the area of affective computing, speech has been identified as a promising biomarker for assessing depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These disorders manifest as abnormalities in speech across various frequency bands and exhibit temporal variations. Most existing work on speech features relies on the magnitude spectrogram, which discards phase information and also does not consider the impact of different frequency bands on depression and ADHD detection. Inspired by these, we propose a novel multi-scale complex feature refinement and dynamic convolution attention-aware network to enhance speech-based assessment of depression and ADHD. Our approach incorporates three key components: multi-scale complex feature refinement (MSFR), dynamic convolutional neural network (Dy-CNN), and dual-attention feature enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSFR module utilizes depth-wise convolutional networks to process both magnitude and phase input, selectively emphasizing frequency bands associated with depression and ADHD. Importantly, the Dy-CNN module employs an attention mechanism to autonomously generate multiple convolution kernels that adapt to input features and capture relevant temporal dynamics linked to depression and ADHD. Additionally, the DAFE module enhances feature representation and detection performance by incorporating channel shuffle attention (CSA) and spatial axial attention (SAA) mechanisms, which leverage both inter- and intra-channel relationships and examine time-frequency characteristics of the feature map. Extensive experiments conducted on four publicly available datasets, i.e., AVEC2013, AVEC2014, E-DAIC, and a self-collected authentic ADHD dataset demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches and exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different language settings (i.e., English, German) for speech-based depression and ADHD assessment.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction. Nowadays, many studies have developed fusion algorithms for this purpose. However, two challenges are still present, i.e., insufficient cross-modal information sharing and weak fusion feature representations. To this end, we develop a novel framework, namely CH-Net, for multi-modal emotion recognition with physiological signals. It is based on cross-modal attention and hypercomplex domain fusion. First, our learnable cross-modal attention mechanism adaptively aligns features across modalities, enhancing both complementarity and modality-specific discrepancies. Second, a hypercomplex fusion module encodes these features, yielding more robust representations while reducing parameter overhead. Two benchmark datasets, i.e., MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP, are utilized to train and test our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CH-Net is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xuxusky/CH-Net.},

  abstract     = {In the era of large language models (LLMs), tasks associated with “System I” cognition—those that are fast, automatic, and intuitive, such as sentiment analysis and text classification—are often considered effectively solved. However, sarcasm remains a persistent challenge. As a subtle and complex linguistic phenomenon, sarcasm frequently involves rhetorical devices such as hyperbole and figurative language to express implicit sentiments and intentions, demanding a higher level of abstraction and pragmatic reasoning than standard sentiment analysis. This raises concerns about whether current claims of LLM success extend robustly to the domain of sarcasm understanding. To systematically investigate this issue, we introduce a new high-quality multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset, termed AMSD, and construct a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, SarcasmBench. Our benchmark encompasses 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and 8 strong pretrained language models (PLMs), evaluated across six widely-used textual sarcasm datasets and three multi-modal sarcasm benchmarks. We adopt three popular prompting paradigms: zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Our extensive experiments yield three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 and Gemini 2.0 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. We hope this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource for the research community and inspire future work toward more robust and human-aligned sarcasm understanding.},

Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities–including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos–and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

To address these issues, we introduce LibEER, a comprehensive benchmark and algorithm library designed to facilitate fair comparisons in EER. LibEER carefully selects popular and powerful baselines, harmonizes key implementation details across methods, and provides a standardized codebase in PyTorch. By offering a consistent evaluation framework with standardized experimental settings, LibEER enables unbiased assessments of seventeen representative deep learning models for EER across the six most widely used datasets. Additionally, we conduct a thorough, reproducible comparison of model performance and efficiency, providing valuable insights to guide researchers in the selection and design of EER models. Moreover, we make observations and in-depth analysis on the experiment results and identify current challenges in this community.

  abstract     = {Depression and bipolar disorder (BD) are mental disorders that are often misdiagnosed as each other because their symptoms often overlap. Depression is characterized by prolonged negative emotion, which is persistent feelings of sadness. In contrast, BD is characterized by repeated extreme changes of emotions, consisting of manic (very happy) and depression (very sad) episodes. Because of overlapping symptoms, changes of emotions indicating depression or BD are difficult to recognize from individual posts. We propose two deep learning models to detect depression and BD from user posts, considering individual posts and multiple posts. A novel method to extract emotion features is designed by fine-tuning a transformer model to extract the intensity of emotions of the posts. Text features are extracted using word embedding models that have been fine tuned on mental health data, and we further consider topic features by using a topic modeling method. Multiple posts are considered by grouping them based on a time interval between the posts. The features of each group are concatenated, input into a convolution neural network (CNN), and go through a long short-term memory (LSTM). The attention mechanism is used to pay attention to important groups. The most important groups can be observed further to explain why the model classified depression and BD users. Our proposed model outperforms other models, achieving an F1-Score of 0.9589. Based on our experiment, the changes of emotions within four days are necessary for distinguishing depression and BD, which aligns with considerations in diagnosing symptoms of depression and BD.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to accurately identify sentiment orientations by integrating information from multiple modalities such as text, audio, and video. However, a key challenge in multimodal fusion is effectively balancing the sufficiency and necessity of information across modalities. Traditional models often fail to qualify and capture this balance due to the presence of noise and redundant information in multimodal data, leading to suboptimal performance in sentiment analysis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal sentiment analysis method called UCMIB-PNS, which is guided by information bottleneck and probabilistic causality. The method employs an Uncertain Cross-Modal Information Bottleneck (UCMIB) module to reduce redundant information within modalities and maximize discriminative information. The UCMIB utilizes codebooks to dynamically record the distributions of samples and employs random sampling to conduct uncertain modeling across different modalities. It integrates uncertainty-aware contrastive learning and KL divergence for dynamic comparison and compression of information from different modalities. Moreover, UCMIB-PNS uses differentiable Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) estimators to estimate and re-weight the sufficiency and necessity of modalities by constructing several counterfactual scenarios through end-to-end learning. Experiments conducted on four publicly available multimodal sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate that UCMIB-PNS achieves optimal performance on both clean and noisy data. Extended experiments further validate the method's robustness under different types of noise.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Depression Estimation (MDE) aims to infer individual depression scores by analyzing various signals, such as visual, auditory, and language signals etc. Compared to Multimodal Depression Detection (MDD) methods that only provide discrete labels, MDE can provide a more refined score evaluation. However, symptom heterogeneity leads to differences in external behaviors among patients with similar depressive states, which limits the performance of direct regression MDE methods. To address this issue, we propose a Combined Depression Level and Deviation (CDLD) method for MDE, which separates samples at different depression levels and further analyzes subtle deviations within same level to improve estimation performance. Specifically, the Multilevel Depression Separation module constructs depression levels with inherent commonalities based on psychological theories and models the ordinality of these levels, thereby separating samples with different levels of depression. Building on this, the Level-specific Deviation Regression module contrasts sample features relative to level-specific anchors, regressing the subtle depression deviation. Finally, the depression level and deviation are integrated to infer the depression score more accurately. Experiments on the DAIC-WOZ, CMDC, SEARCH, and AVEC 2014 datasets demonstrate that the proposed coarse-to-fine method effectively mitigates the impact of symptom heterogeneity on depression estimation performance, showing significant advantages in MDE tasks.

  abstract     = {Machine learning, particularly deep learning, typically achieves high facial emotion image recognition accuracy benefiting from multiple labeled data. However, the datasets usually contain insufficient labeled samples and numerous unlabeled data since human labeling is a costly endeavor. For semi-supervised learning of these datasets, self-training procedure solely based on the visual features of images fails to comprehensively understand the intricate high-level semantic features. Since EEG signals contain not only visual information related to the visual stimulus but also emotional information related to brain activity, they are highly suitable as supervisory signals for labeling unlabeled facial emotion images. In this study, we specifically employ EEG signals evoked by visual image stimuli in conjunction with EEGNet3D to learn a discriminative EEG class representation manifold of brain activity. The one-hot class label is replaced with the EEG class representation as the supervisory to train the base model. Then, better pseudo-labeling is achieved using the base model in the EEG class representation manifold. Based on pseudo-labeling results, the utilization of unlabeled data is further improved. Interestingly, our findings reveal that when utilizing EEG class representations as supervisory information for the base model, the base model demonstrates a learning pattern that involves focusing more on the eye area when making judgments about emotions. This behavior closely resembles how the human brain decodes emotions. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed method can be effectively enhanced by combining labeled and pseudo-labeled images. Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization abilities when applied to new image datasets and other visual networks.},

This approach addresses the limitations of temporal graphs in capturing global and local correlations in music signals for music emotion recognition tasks. Frequency graphs integrate timbre and chroma audio features to capture both local and global correlations in music, enhancing emotion classification and segmentation. The graph feature extractor module improves the dissemination of hierarchical feature information through control units and enhances the depiction of remote node attributes via shortcut connections. Additionally, the multi-channel feature extractor module expands the receptive field, enhancing inter-channel feature extraction. The integration of these modules enables the model to proficiently extract musical frequency features, uncovering latent correlations among various frequencies and their impact on emotion recognition. Empirical validation across the 1000songs, PMEmo, and Memo2496 datasets demonstrates the strategy's efficacy, with MCGC-net achieving classification accuracies of 79.03% for Arousal and 70.05% for Valence on 1000songs; 85.81% and 75.42% on PMEmo; and 79.52% and 78.61% on Memo2496, respectively.

In this paper, to better exploit key facial regions, we propose the Temporal cue guided Deformable Landmark Spatial (TDLS) transformer which attends to key facial regions in a data-dependent manner. We also propose the temporal cue guided frame representation learning to learn the spatial representation of each frame by considering features of other frames together. To better model temporal dependencies, we propose the Multi-layer Group Constrained Temporal (MGCT) transformer to summarize features of frames to multi-layer groups, perform group-to-group communications, and let group-level features guide the frame-level emotion recognition. We also introduce cross-clip representation learning to generate consistent results across different clips and videos.

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition is essential for medical assistance and human-computer interaction. Although deep learning-based emotion recognition methods have demonstrated high performance, several challenges remain: 1) How to effectively utilize the complex dynamic-static spatial patterns inherent in emotion-related EEG signals. 2) How to hierarchically learn the latent correlations among multi-domain features. To address these challenges, a spatio-temporal representation fusion learning network (STRFLNet) is proposed to improve both the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition using EEG signals. Specifically, dynamic-static graph topologies are constructed to capture comprehensive brain functional connectivity states, and a continuous dynamic-static graph ordinary differential equations is introduce to reveal continuous spatial patterns within EEG signals. Additionally, a hierarchical transformer fusion module is developed to fully leverage the latent correlations among multi-domain features to obtain the fused spatio-temporal representation. The experimental results on the SEED, SEED-IV, and DREAMER public EEG emotion datasets, under both subject-independent and subject-dependent settings, demonstrate that STRFLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition tasks. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model through interpretability analysis, which reveals the associations between the activated brain regions and corresponding emotional states. Our work highlights the significance of continuous spatial pattern learning and spatio-temporal feature fusion in emotion recognition, providing new insights for EEG-based emotion modeling.},

  abstract     = {In order to achieve early screening and assist clinical decision-making, automatic depression assessment based on multimodal data are highly anticipated. However, the existed methods often suffer from semantic gap and information redundancy due to heterogeneity among modalities. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a novel Feature Disentanglement and Fusion Network (FDFNet) for predicting depression severity from audio-visual cues. Firstly, we design the shared and private encoders to disentangle modality-shared and modalityprivate representations. The former representation that acquires joint information is subjected by similarity constraints between modalities to ensure their distributions as close as possible. The latter that can capture unique features of each modality is restrained by independence constraints for keeping their distributions distinct. The decoder is then developed to reconstruct unimodal representation with constraints to minimize information loss. Finally, an efficient fusion strategy through addition and concatenation is ultilized for aggregating information. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FDFNet consistently outperforms several stateof-the-art methods, with the competitive MAE/RMSE values of 6.22/7.58 on AVEC2013, 5.21/6.49 on AVEC2014, 4.25/5.34 on DAIC-WOZ, and 4.41/5.10 on E-DAIC, indicating that multimodal deep learning based on audio-visual is an attractive solution for objectively evaluating the depression severity.},

In online classroom scenarios, severe state anxiety over a long period significantly affects the physical and mental health of high school students. Researchers often use students' facial videos to assess their state anxiety. However, videobased assessment methods face challenges with data and clues, limiting their effectiveness in assessing student state anxiety. First, previous datasets mainly focused on the general population and there was a lack of a domain-specific dataset. Second, a single video provides limited clues, making it challenging for assessment methods to make accurate judgments when the student consistently displays a neutral expression. To address the data challenge, we collected the first state anxiety dataset containing 3,701 video clips from 106 high school students. To solve the clue challenge, we constructed a student-level stateanxiety-oriented graph and proposed a graph-based assessment method for student state anxiety at the video-level. This method incorporates course information, event information, students' academic and mental health statuses, and the earlier video information. Three well-designed attention modules are used to fuse these clues for better performance. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that our method is highly accurate in assessing students' state anxiety, with minimal errors (MSE = 0.1380, MAE = 0.2768).},

To address these challenges, we propose Phy-FusionNet, a novel memory-augmented transformer architecture for multimodal emotion recognition. Phy-FusionNet introduces a Memory Stream Module with FIFO-queue and decay-based updates to preserve long-term contextual information. It further integrates Fourier-based positional encoding and frequency-aware attention, enabling robust detection of periodic emotional cues. An Adaptive Temporal Attention Module enhances computational efficiency and enables dynamic relevance in temporal feature extraction. For cross-modal fusion, we employ a transformer-based Multimodal Binding Learning framework that balances modality-specific and shared features. Extensive experiments on five public datasets—WESAD, CL-Drive, PPB-Emo, PhyMER, and EEG-VUI—demonstrate that Phy-FusionNet outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 16.3% improvement in accuracy and superior robustness across diverse emotional states and noisy environments. Notably, the model maintains low performance variance across emotion classes, with F1-Score differences under 2.5%, indicating stable recognition even for subtle or overlapping emotions. Our results underscore the importance of integrating memory, frequency, and adaptive attention for effective affective computing. The code will be publicly available on GitHub.},

Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.},

A major challenge in FL is the non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of data across devices, which hinders training efficiency and slows convergence. To tackle this, we propose Federated Impurity Weighting (FedImp), a novel algorithm that quantifies each device’s contribution based on the informational content of its local data. These contributions are normalized to compute distinct aggregation weights for the global model update. Extensive experiments on EMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that FedImp significantly improves convergence speed, reducing communication rounds by up to 64.4%, 27.8%, and 66.7% on EMNIST, and 44.2%, 44%, and 25.6% on CIFAR-10 compared to FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdp, respectively. Under highly imbalanced data distributions, FedImp outperforms all baselines and achieves the highest accuracy.

Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

Calibration of a network measures the probability of correctness for any of its predictions, which is crucial for high-risk domains where reliable predictions are essential. In this paper, we study how to obtain a calibrated student from an uncalibrated teacher. Our approach relies on the fusion of the data-augmentation techniques, including but not limited to Mixup and CutMix, with knowledge distillation. We incorporate and analyze the impact of focal loss in the distillation framework to further improve the calibration of the student model. We perform extensive experiments to validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet and Diabetic Retinopathy datasets, and compare it with various techniques like CRD, RKD, DKD and MLLD to obtain calibrated student models. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to dissect the influence of augmentation techniques and the integration of focal loss.

In this paper, we introduce a robust, two-step PU learning algorithm by incorporating a potential negative sampler in step 1 (warm start) and minimizing a self-correcting regularized risk function in step 2. The risk function possesses a self-correcting property that attempts to mitigate the weakness of the potential negative sampler in the warm start step.

To address this, we propose a novel Wasserstein Distance Based Multi-Source Heterogeneous Graph Adaptation framework (WMHGA), which aims to learn transferable node representations across networks in order to improve the accuracy of node classification tasks. Specifically, we propose a Wasserstein Distance Based Heterogeneous Graph Adaptation (WHGA) approach to learn node representations that are invariant to domain variations. Then, we propose two Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation approaches to identify more valuable samples from the source graph and learn label-discriminative node representations of these samples for knowledge transfer. In addition, we devise a Wasserstein distance-based aggregated prediction to prioritize highly relevant source nodes while suppressing irrelevant ones, thereby ensuring more accurate node classification in the target network.

  abstract     = {The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.

  abstract     = {Lightweight deep neural networks have played a pivotal role in real-time semantic segmentation for autonomous driving in resource-constrained devices, which need to effectively learn the local semantics and global context at multiple scales due to varying object sizes. Recent methods design shallow and lightweight backbones with a small receptive field for faster inference, along with additional mechanisms such as attention to compensate for the accuracy loss due to the lightweight design. While some methods have exploited multi-scale feature learning by attaching pyramid modules at the encoder end, it is often neglected at the fundamental block level due to increased inference time. Furthermore, the attention weights are mostly generated at a single object scale by only using the high-level feature representations. To solve the first problem, a key module for the basic block, the Fast Hybrid Module (FHM), has been proposed. This module uses a hybrid approach to learn multi-scale features by combining dilated kernels and downsampling operations in a parallel three-branch structure. To solve the second problem, a novel attention module, the Multi-Scale Attention Module (MSAM), is proposed. MSAM uniquely generates context weights at varying scales from the low-level features rich in object boundary and edge information and multiplies them by the high-level semantic features obtained from the encoder. With these modules, a novel encoder-decoder network named Context Guided Multi-scale Attention Network (CGMA-Net) is proposed. With only 0.54 Million parameters, the network achieves 73.4% and 68.1% mean IoU accuracy at 128.24 and 85.5 FPS on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, respectively. In addition, the network can run in real-time on embedded GPUs with resource constraints. Through extensive ablation studies, the effectiveness of the proposed modules and network is shown. The qualitative results on unseen data demonstrate the robustness of the method. Code available at: https://github.com/saquibmazhar/SemanticSegmentation-CGMANet.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is valuable in many applications, such as emergency search and rescue, and has received increasing attention in recent years. Given their distinct tasks and dynamic characteristics, the UAV team is typically controlled with higher maneuverability for rapid searching, while the UGV team is operated on roads at lower speeds to ensure stability and performance. This discrepancy naturally results in a multirate control problem, which has not been adequately addressed in previous works. Therefore, we present a multirate distributed receding horizon reinforcement learning (RHRL) framework to solve the optimal UAV-UGV formation control problem on fast and slow time scales. The proposed approach includes a distributed RHRL algorithm operating at a slower time scale for the formation control of UGV teams, and another distributed RHRL algorithm functioning at a faster time scale for the formation control of UAV teams. The state information among homogeneous UAV/UGV agents and heterogeneous agents across different teams are exchanged at different frequencies to balance control performance and communication load. Notably, our approach integrates the receding horizon strategy to enhance learning efficiency and provides theoretical guarantees in multirate distributed RL. Theoretically, learning convergence at different time scales and closed-loop stability are guaranteed. Comparative numerical validations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in heterogeneous UAV-UGV formation control under different time scales and tasks.},

In distributed optimal cluster consensus control design, we view each agent’s control policy and its neighboring followers’ control policy as rival players, then a fuzzy distributed optimal cluster consensus control policy is proposed by applying differential graphical game theory and acyclic partition. Since the analytical optimal cluster consensus control solutions are reduced to solving the distributed game algebraic Riccati equations (GAREs), which is difficult to obtain their analytical solutions, a data-driven VI algorithm is presented. It is proved that the developed algorithm can converge to the approximation solutions of optimal controllers, and the proposed fuzzy distributed optimal cluster consensus control scheme not only guarantees the followers in each cluster to asymptotically track their corresponding leaders but also achieves the Nash equilibrium of differential graphical game. Finally, we apply the developed fuzzy distributed optimal cluster consensus control method with a data-driven VI algorithm to multiple nonlinear unmanned surface vehicle (USV) systems, the computer simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed optimal control approach.},

However, existing BLS-based CIL methods struggle with complex data distributions and are highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, leading to suboptimal knowledge retention. To address these challenges, we propose CIBLS-PLS (Class-Incremental Broad Learning System with Pseudo-Label-Guided Stacked Structure), which enhances knowledge retention and adaptability. Different from traditional stacked BLS, where blocks are strictly chained through input-output dependencies, CIBLS-PLS adopts a more flexible stacking structure, allowing each block to independently contribute to knowledge preservation. Each BLS layer integrates dual-storage modules that retain key features from previous data, while pseudo-labels are generated to facilitate seamless knowledge integration within the stacked residual learning framework. Model parameters are updated efficiently via closed-form ridge regression, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, to further enhance model generalization, an adaptive scaling mechanism dynamically regulates the contribution of residual blocks, effectively preventing overfitting as the number of blocks increases. This property is rigorously validated through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. Results on seven large-scale image datasets demonstrate that CIBLS-PLS achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and knowledge retention while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, paving the way for robust and scalable broad learning-based incremental models.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot segmentation (FSS) strives to segment novel categories using merely a limited number of labeled images. Current prototype learning and correlation learning approaches struggle to effectively harness both high- and low-level information from support and query images, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. In this work, we propose a multi-layer feature cross-activation (FCA) network with high- and low-level prototypes (HLP), which fully utilizes support and query information from both features and prototypes perspectives. Specifically, for the FCA module, we design a simple activation method that uses all the pixel-level support foreground features to activate query features, thereby obtaining activation maps without losing pixel-level detail information of support features. For the HLP module, we combine image-level prototypes with pixel-level prototypes to fully utilize high-level category information and low-level attribute information of support features. Besides, the prototype generation method integrates query information, which further enables the prototypes to better match target query features, especially when there are great differences between query and support images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i under 1-shot and 5-shot settings validate the effectiveness of our FCA-HLP. Our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the multi-layer feature cross-activation network in the absence of the HLP module. The results indicate that even without prototypes, the FCA module can still deliver strong performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/Jiaguang-NEU/FCA-HLP.},

The camouflage technique must maintain the concealment capability across various environments and geographic regions. However, existing approaches, including manual design, computer-aided techniques, and deep learning methods, face significant challenges in achieving automation, scalability, and generalization across diverse and uncalibrated scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based method with few-shot learning to generate environment-guided camouflage patterns. Our method, called CamoX, consists of two major stages: meta learning and few-shot learning. In the meta learning stage, our method introduces a latent diffusion-based architecture that automatically generates camouflage patterns from noise, eliminating manual intervention and enabling scalable production. In the few-shot learning stage, our approach enforces similarity between the latent features of the camouflage patterns and target scenes by optimizing the guided mean absolute error loss. This innovation allows the generated camouflage patterns to adapt seamlessly to multiple environments with minimal retraining. Furthermore, this paper introduces a comprehensive camouflage dataset, called Camo-Meta, comprising 144,750 realistic camouflage patterns and associated metadata to support research in camouflage generation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that CamoX outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics.},

Then, the three key aspects of AI transparency, that is, transparent to whom, transparent of what, and how to be transparent, are examined. Building upon this groundwork, we propose a novel sociotechnical framework that uniquely integrates both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions of AI transparency while accounting for the roles of internal and external stakeholders, resulting in a three-layered AI transparency framework encompassing intrinsic, internal, and external transparency. This comprehensive framework not only deepens our understanding of AI transparency but also provides a structured roadmap for navigating the complex sociotechnical landscape of AI systems. Our main contribution lies in developing this novel conceptual framework that enriches both the theory and practice of AI transparency and provides guidelines for designing and deploying transparent AI systems in the future.},

  abstract     = {One important application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is optimizing treatment decisions in healthcare. However, a na¨ıve RL policy can lead to unsafe medical decisions, such as excessive dosages or abrupt treatment changes, often because agents fail to account for common-sense constraints. To mitigate these problems, Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) naturally emerges as a promising approach for safer decision-making by optimizing policies under predefined constraints. To extend CRL to healthcare applications, a fundamental challenge lies in accurately specifying the constraint function for different healthcare scenarios. Recent Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a promising approach that infers constraints from expert demonstrations. However, ICRL algorithms model Markovian decisions and rely on real-time interactive environments. These settings do not align with the practical requirement of a decision-making system in healthcare, where decisions rely on historical treatment recorded in an offline dataset. To tackle these issues, we propose the Constraint Transformer (CT). Specifically, 1) we utilize a causal attention mechanism to incorporate historical decisions and observations into the constraint modeling, while employing a Non-Markovian layer for weighted constraints to capture critical states. 2) A generative world model is used for exploratory data augmentation, enabling offline RL methods to simulate unsafe decision sequences. In multiple medical scenarios, empirical results demonstrate that CT can capture unsafe states and achieve strategies that approximate lower mortality rates, reducing the occurrence probability of unsafe behaviors.},

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) offer a promising paradigm for AI-driven control by dynamically adjusting the wireless environment through Phase Configuration Sequence (PCS) bits sent from the Base Station (BS). By steering signals intelligently, RIS can improve coverage and direct transmissions to specific locations. However, the increasing size of RIS and rapidly changing IoT device positions in dynamic environments impose significant feedback bandwidth constraints due to frequent PCS bits updates. To address this, we propose a novel Attention-Guided Encoder-Decoder with Normalization Enhancement (AGENE) framework that compresses PCS bits at the BS using a lightweight encoder and reconstructs them at the RIS controller using a decoder. Our design incorporates a custom attention mechanism and Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN)/Inverse GDN layers to enhance feature extraction and normalization. We also evaluate our method under different noise models, including Gaussian and Rician noise, to test robustness in practical scenarios. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method (AGENE), we compared its performance with existing methods across different compression ratios and noise conditions, focusing on loss reduction and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE). In Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions, AGENE achieved a loss reduction of 28.12% compared to PSC-DN, 43.9% compared to DL-CsiNet, and 58.18% compared to CsiNet at a compression ratio of 2/9. Under Rician noise, AGENE showed a reduction of 19.39% compared to PSC-DN, 37.01% compared to DL-CsiNet, and 45.21% compared to CsiNet, again at the same compression ratio. These results consistently demonstrate that AGENE outperforms existing methods by a significant margin across both metrics and noise conditions.},

  abstract     = {The examination of complex diseases has greatly benefited from machine-learning techniques for interpreting biomedical signals. However, for diseases with multifactorial etiologies, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), the inability of associative methods to distinguish between causal relationships and mere correlations often leads to unreliable outcomes. In contrast, causal models require well-defined causal structures, demanding a thorough understanding of their contributing factors. This study proposes a Generative Adversarial Network framework for Counterfactual Causal Inference (C2I-GAN) to uncover causal patterns from biomedical signals without a predefined causal structure. The framework leverages graph attention network to identify key features for directing counterfactual generation, applies generative adversarial learning to produce task-oriented counterfactuals, and supports inference by evaluating how modifications to specific features affect diagnostic outcomes. A case study of ASD evaluation is conducted on a resting-state EEG dataset (74 ASD and 143 TD children) using C2I-GAN against state-of-the-art methods (Associative: GAT; Counterfactual: CounteRGAN, Omnixai, and CXGAN). The findings show that C2I-GAN identified T3, T4, O1, and O2 channels as causal patterns while recognizing C3 and C4 as merely associative, aligning with the latest neuroscience evidence where counterpart methods failed. In terms of performance, the model improved actionability by 30E and accuracy by 10E compared to other counterfactual methods, and increased accuracy by 5E while reducing training loss by 20E against associative method, demonstrating enhanced precision and efficiency.},

Accurate air quality prediction is a complex spatiotemporal problem, that involves pollutant spatiotemporal dependencies and meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and transformation. However, existing predictive models often underestimate the critical influence of atmospheric conditions by treating air quality and meteorological data as a single, homogeneous modality or by using only limited surface-level features, which impairs performance. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that takes historical air quality observations and multi-pressure-level meteorological data as input, explicitly modeling them as distinct modalities, while uniquely leveraging multi-step weather forecasts as dynamic prompts to guide prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet and a public dataset KDDCUP-Beijing demonstrate MDSTNet’s superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54’ compared to the state-of-the-art model, showcasing the significant advantage of our meteorology-guided, modality-decoupled design.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks of intelligent transportation systems. The complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies make the traffic flow prediction quite challenging. Although existing spatial-temporal graph neural networks hold prominent, they often encounter challenges of using a static graph with the same set of edge weights across different time points, which greatly limits the representational power of spatial graph structures, as well as lacking capability of capturing spatial-temporal patterns at different time scales from a single time point to multiple time points. In this paper, we propose a fully adaptive Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN, which consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate recurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the complex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time steps. We integrate node embeddings with temporal position information at multiple scales to construct fully adaptive graphs and propose adaptive position graph convolution networks for capturing spatial dependencies in specific temporal contexts. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal position-aware attention mechanism that unifies adaptive graph convolutions and self-attention for joint spatial-temporal dependency learning. simultaneously capture spatialtemporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show that our model outperforms 23 baselines with significant margins in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-domain of machine learning, mainly concerned with solving sequential decision-making problems by a learning agent that interacts with the decision environment to improve its behaviour through the reward it receives from the environment. This learning paradigm is, however, well-known for being time-consuming due to the necessity of collecting a large amount of data, making RL suffer from sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Furthermore, the construction of an explicit reward function that accounts for the trade-off between multiple desiderata of a decision problem is often a laborious task. These challenges have been recently addressed utilizing transfer and inverse RL (T-IRL). In this regard, this paper is devoted to a comprehensive review of realizing the sample efficiency and generalization of RL algorithms through T-IRL. Following a brief introduction to RL, the fundamental T-IRL methods are presented and the most recent advancements in each research field have been extensively reviewed. Our findings denote that a majority of recent research works have dealt with the aforementioned challenges by utilizing human-in-the-loop and sim-to-real strategies for the efficient transfer of knowledge from source domains to the target domain under the transfer learning scheme. Under the IRL structure, training schemes that require a low number of experience transitions and extension of such frameworks to multi-agent and multi-intention problems have been the priority of researchers in recent years. This survey first reviews the theoretical foundations of RL and its challenges, then presents recent advances in T-IRL, and concludes with a discussion of open research directions and future trends.},

  abstract     = {Optimal control of unknown nonlinear systems is challenging due to the absence of the underlying dynamics model. Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective framework for such control by optimizing policies with measurement data of the system. However, RL often suffers from (i) low sample efficiency due to the absence of domain knowledge (e.g., dynamics model) and (ii) low learning efficiency due to slow propagation of the reward signal. Model-based RL methods and multi-step RL methods were proposed to address these two challenges, respectively. It is natural to combine these two methods to take advantage of both benefits. However, this combination requires the learned single one-step dynamics model, commonly used in model-based settings, to perform multi-step prediction in a recursive manner, leading to the error accumulation (also known as compounding error) problem. This work presents a multi-model dynamics learning framework to address the error accumulation challenge for general model-based multi-step RL methods by circumventing the recursive prediction. We also present a specific multi-model-based multi-step RL algorithm and validate it on benchmark nonlinear systems. It is shown that the multi-model framework improves multi-step prediction of dynamics and that the presented multi-model-based multi-step RL mostly outperforms model-free, single-model, and one-step counterparts, respectively. We also discuss the limitations of this work and potential future work.},

Successor features (SFs) and Generalised Policy Improvement (GPI) have been adopted as a robust framework to achieve TRL expressing rewards as a linear combination of a shared feature function and a task-specific vector weights. SF-GPI are used for reusing, fast learning, and composing a fixed set of policies derived from SFs through two-level decision-making, which can be understood as a hierarchical method. However, SF-GPI performance on target tasks is related to the distance from the source tasks’ vector weights, limiting their ability to ensure optimal policies for more distant tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel composition mechanism by defining a new Markov decision process involving high-level states and actions constructed of SFs, resulting in a high-level policy which adaptively selects high-level actions. This approach facilitates knowledge transfer across a varied-distance set of tasks without performance degradation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our approach learns and composes SF representations, outperforming SF-GPI by maintaining the performance across a varied-distance set of tasks in 3 widely-used problems in the SFs literature.},

Here, we introduce a novel framework named CARG (Contextual Aggregation of Clues and Role-based Latent Guidance), comprising two innovative components: the Contextual Clues Aggregation (CCA) and the Role-based Latent Information Guidance (RLIG) 1 The CCA module leverages the attention weights derived from a pretrained encoder to adaptively assimilate broader contextual information, while the RLIG module aims to capture the semantic correlations among event roles. We then instantiate the CARG framework into two variants based on two types of mainstream EAE approaches. Notably, our CARG framework introduces less than 1% new parameters yet significantly improves the performance. Comprehensive experiments across the RAMS, WikiEvents, MLEE and ACE 2005 datasets confirm the superiority of CARG, showing significant superiority in terms of both performance and inference speed compared to major benchmarks.

A significant challenge in this task is multi-domain DST, which involves considering dialogue states across multiple domains. Recent advancements have addressed this challenge by exploring various approaches to model the correlations among different domains with domain-slot-specific representations derived from dialogue context and aggregating domain-slot queries using sorts of attention mechanisms. However, existing models still exhibit deficiencies in handling these correlations, either by overlooking or overestimating them. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain DST framework with large language model (LLM) rationale and Disentangled Domain-Slot Attention to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain aware instruction prompt to guide the LLM to generate the corresponding rationale to dialogue history, realizing these correlations along with the robustness against sorts of variations in spoken conversation. Additionally, we present a novel mechanism, termed Disentangled Domain-Slot Attention. This mechanism enables a dynamic, flexible, and context-dependent manner to extract domain-slot-specific information by disentangling domain-slot queries within the attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on the MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets, the results present that the proposed approaches improve the performance of multi-domain DST.

  abstract = {Audio anti-spoofing algorithms are widely deployed to defend against spoofing attacks, yet they often fail to detect unseen attacks. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers the potential to address this challenge, existing methods struggle with the large intra-class variability and complex distribution structures in target domains caused by the diversity of speech and attack types. In contrast, optimal transport (OT) leverages the geometric structure of intra-class distributions to measure discrepancies between probability distributions. The effectiveness of OT relies on the discriminability of data within target domains. However, in real-world scenarios involving multiple target domains, these domains often overlap in feature space, leading to the negative transport problem in OT. To overcome these domain mismatches in anti-spoofing, we propose the Multi-Sinkhorn Teacher Knowledge Aggregation (MSTKA) framework. Initially, to avoid interference between target domains during alignment, we use OT to adapt the source model to each target domain independently, thereby reducing negative transport. This adaptation involves constructing an OT cost matrix based on sentence-level representations of cross-domain samples and training an expert model for each target domain. Subsequently, we aggregate the knowledge from these expert models into a unified student model, enabling it to generalize across multiple target domains. Since spoofing cues could be distributed across different temporal scales, we align the student model's representations at multiple time scales with the teacher model's sentence-level representations to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. Multi-target adaptation experiments on eleven data sets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio anti-spoofing.},

Inspired by the success of large pre-trained models in numerous fields, this paper introduces a robust ASD model that leverages self-supervised pre-trained models trained on large-scale speech and audio datasets. Although there are inconsistencies between the pre-training datasets and the ASD task, our findings indicate that pre-training still provides substantial benefits for ASD. To mitigate overfitting and retain learned knowledge when fine-tuning with limited data, we explore Fully-Connected Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a Machine-aware Group Adapter module, which enables the model to capture differences between various machines within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the generalization performance of ASD systems. To address the challenge of missing attribute labels, we design a novel objective function that dynamically clusters unattributed data using vector quantization and optimizes through a dual-level contrastive learning loss.

Though they conduct qualitative analyses, they still lack comprehensive quantitative analyses to evaluate the quality of demonstrations. Previous studies assume that demonstrations exhibiting high similarity to the test query indicate high quality. We argue that high-quality demonstrations should also align with the preferences of the inference model.

Aiming at this, we propose a General quality Evaluation Metric of demonstrations to the inference model for In-Context learning, named Gemic, without any human-annotation or extra training cost. To verify the effectiveness of Gemic, we take demonstration retrieval task as an illustrative case. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets under different LLMs with multiple scales.

The goal is to better understand their characteristics and behaviors in the context of SED. While SED has been rapidly advancing through the adoption of various deep learning techniques from other pattern recognition fields, such adopted techniques are often not suitable for SED. To address this issue, two frequency-dependent SED methods were previously proposed: FilterAugment, a data augmentation randomly weighting frequency bands, and FDY conv, an architecture applying frequency adaptive convolution kernels. These methods have demonstrated superior performance in SED, and we aim to further analyze their detailed effectiveness and characteristics in SED. We compare class-wise performance to find out specific pros and cons of FilterAugment and FDY conv. We apply Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights time-frequency region that is more inferred by the model, on SED models with and without frequency masking and two types of FilterAugment to observe their detailed characteristics. We propose simpler frequency dependent convolution methods and compare them with FDY conv to further understand which components of FDY conv affects SED performance. Lastly, we apply PCA to show how FDY conv adapts dynamic kernel across frequency dimensions on different sound event classes. The results and discussions demonstrate that frequency dependency plays a significant role in sound event detection and further confirms the effectiveness of frequency dependent methods on SED.},

  abstract = {Blind source separation (BSS) refers to the process of recovering multiple source signals from observations recorded by an array of sensors. Common methods performing BSS, including independent vector analysis (IVA), and independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), typically rely on second-order models to capture the statistical independence of source signals for separation. However, these methods generally do not account for the implicit structural information across frequency bands, which may lead to model mismatches between the assumed source distributions and the distributions of the separated source signals estimated from the observed mixtures. To tackle these limitations, this paper shows that conventional methods such as IVA and ILRMA can easily be leveraged by the Sinkhorn divergence, incorporating an optimal transport (OT) framework to adaptively adjust the estimated power spectral density (PSD) of the sources. This allows for the recovery of the source PSD while modeling the inter-band signal dependence and reallocating spectral power across frequency bands. As a result, enhanced versions of these methods are developed, integrating a Sinkhorn iterative scheme into their standard implementations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently enhance BSS performance.},

  abstract = {A near-end listening enhancement (NELE) method that combines harmonic (non-linear) distortion with linear distortion for improving speech intelligibility in noisy conditions without altering the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is proposed. Parameters were optimized across noise types, SNRs, and reverberation using a Genetic Algorithm with Speech Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB) as the loss function. Subjective experiments confirmed that, on average, the odds of correctly recognizing a word treated with the proposed method were 18.8 higher relative to plain speech when presented at $-9$ dB SNR, averaged over the results of Cafeteria and Speech-Shaped Noise (SSN). In Cafeteria noise, the odds of correct recognition were 16.4 times higher compared to plain speech, while in SSN they were about 8.4 times higher, averaged across SNRs ranging from $-9$ to $-3$ dB. Objective evaluation further confirmed its superiority to alternative approaches in reverberant maskers. These results demonstrate that combining harmonic and linear distortions can substantially improve intelligibility in adverse listening conditions.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the topic of answering subjective questions about products by multi-perspective induction. Unlike traditional factoid QA, whose answers are unique and can be extracted directly from the text, the answers to subjective QA are not a simple text span, but involve various viewpoints and facts. A good answer should incorporate both objective facts and subjective opinions from various sources. Facts often involve multiple fine-grained product aspects, some of which are implicit and not explicitly mentioned. The opinions are complex, hidden, and scattered. Questions may be vague, sometimes requiring commonsense inference. This challenging task has wide-ranging applications, but limited research has studied it. To address this problem, we propose a new model to answer subjective questions in an inductive way. Given a question, we first retrieve the missing but necessary commonsense knowledge to supplement its implicit aspects and hidden relations, to better understand the ask points and users' needs. We then parse and build an aspect tree from the factual data, such as product descriptions, to incorporate all aspects and their parent-child relations. Based on the tree, we infer the question-related aspects from the retrieved content. For each aspect, we aggregate its scattered opinions and objective facts to yield a summary. To deal with diverse types adaptively, we construct an aspect-controlled generation model. Each aspect summary would add a prefix that is learned through a trainable gating mechanism and fused into a multi-aspect decoder to derive a comprehensive answer. The whole model with a retriever and generator is jointly trained by a reinforced framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on our created large-scale SupQA dataset, and the results show the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Disentangled speech representation learning for speaker verification aims to separate spoken content and speaker timbre into distinct representations. However, existing variational autoencoder (VAE)–based methods for speech disentanglement rely on latent variables that lack semantic meaning, limiting their effectiveness for speaker verification. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based method that disentangles and separates speaker features and speech content in the latent space. Building upon the VAE framework, we employ a speaker encoder to learn latent variables representing speaker features while using frame-specific latent variables to capture content. Unlike previous sequential VAE approaches, our method utilizes a conditional diffusion model in the latent space to derive speaker-aware representations. Experiments on the VoxCeleb and CN-Celeb datasets demonstrate that our method effectively isolates speaker features from speech content using pre-trained speech representations. The learned embeddings are robust to language mismatches since the speaker embeddings become content-invariant after content removal. Additionally, we design contrastive learning experiments showing that our training objective can enhance the learning of speaker-discriminative embeddings without relying on classification-based loss.},

  abstract = {Few-shot Class-incremental Audio Classification (FCAC) aims to progressively recognize incremental classes with few tagged samples and meanwhile memorize base classes. To achieve satisfactory FCAC performance, the model needs to have high stability (memorizing base classes) and strong plasticity (adapting to incremental classes). In this work, we design a model which can be decoupled into two independent modules, namely an embedding learner and a stochastic classifier. The former is the backbone of a residual convolutional network, while the latter is composed of distributions and each distribution consists of a mean vector and a variance vector for representing one class. After being trained in the base session, the embedding learner is not updated in each incremental session and thus can memorize the knowledge of base classes. To make the embedding learner possess strong representation ability for incremental classes, we propose a strategy to pseudo-incrementally train the embedding learner using data augmentation in the base session. On the other hand, the stochastic classifier is continually updated in each incremental session and thus can adapt to incremental classes. Our model which consists of a pseudo-incrementally trained embedding learner and a continually updated stochastic classifier can increasingly identify incremental classes without forgetting base classes. Three datasets (FSC-89, NSynth-100 and LS-100) are used to verify the effectiveness of our method. Experiments show that our method exceeds the comparison methods in accuracy, and has lower complexity than most of the comparison methods. The code is at https://github.com/vinceasvp/PITEL-CUSC.},

Recent studies have investigated pre-trained models for feature extraction and adopted advanced architectures, including convolutional and graph neural networks, for deepfake detection. Although these methods improve detection performance to some extent, their generalization and robustness still face challenges. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a forgery detection method based on the fusion of dual pre-trained features and an optimized Transformer architecture. Specifically, we use a cross-attention mechanism to fuse the audio features extracted from pre-trained Wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM, and replace the token mixer in the traditional Transformer architecture with wavelet transform and multi-scale pooling operations. By combining dual pre-trained features, we extract more comprehensive and discriminative features while optimizing the Transformer architecture, which not only reduces time complexity but also enhances detection performance. We conducted experiments on several datasets, and the results show that our model achieves impressive detection performance with EERs of 0.13%, 2.33%, 3.63%, 10.25%, 5.15%, and 0.21% on the ASVspoof 2019LA, ASVspoof 2021LA, ASVspoof 2021DF, In-the-Wild, Fake-or-Real, and ASVspoof 2015LA evaluation datasets, respectively.},

  abstract = {Traditional active noise control (ANC) algorithms suffer significant performance degradation when addressing impulsive noise. Recent advancements in robust ANC algorithms have focused on the design and application of effective cost functions. A class of ANC algorithms based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC), which uses entropy as a robust adaptive cost function, has shown promising capability in handing heavy-tailed impulsive noise. However, the performance of these algorithms heavily relies on empirically manual parameter tuning, which poses challenges for practical applications. To address this, this paper proposes a filtered-x generalized adaptive robust function (FxGARF) algorithm. The robustness is quantified by a continuous parameter that can adaptively adjust based on the residual distribution. Additionally, to enhance the control precision of the algorithm, the scale parameter involved in the generalized robust kernel family is determined by the mean value of the noise signal filtered through Hampel filter. Thus, the proposed algorithm can adapt to noise characteristics, eliminating the need for manual kernel parameter tuning. Moreover, the mean convergence and mean-square performance of the FxGARF algorithm are analyzed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm adaptively selects kernel parameters for impulsive noise of varying characteristics and achieves superior noise reduction performance compared to benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract = {The steered response power (SRP) method is one of the most popular approaches for acoustic source localization with microphone arrays. It is often based on simplifying acoustic assumptions, such as an omnidirectional sound source in the far field of the microphone array(s), free field propagation, and spatially uncorrelated noise. In reality, however, there are many acoustic scenarios where such assumptions are violated. This paper proposes a generalization of the conventional SRP method that allows to apply generic acoustic models for localization with arbitrary microphone constellations. These models may consider, for instance, level differences in distributed microphones, the directivity of sources and receivers, or acoustic shadowing effects. Moreover, also measured acoustic transfer functions may be applied as acoustic model. We show that the delay-and-sum beamforming of the conventional SRP is not optimal for localization with generic acoustic models. To this end, we propose a generalized SRP beamforming criterion that considers generic acoustic models and spatially correlated noise, and derive an optimal SRP beamformer. Furthermore, we propose and analyze appropriate frequency weightings. Unlike the conventional SRP, the proposed method can jointly exploit observed level and time differences between the microphone signals to infer the source location. Realistic simulations of three different microphone setups with speech under various noise conditions indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the mean localization error compared to the conventional SRP and, in particular, a reduction of more than 60% can be archived in noisy conditions.},

A novel multiscale trend-aware multi-head self-attention network is designed to capture the long-term global correlations and short-term local dependencies of speech signals across different time scales, enabling effective global and local receptive fields during the reconstruction of lost packets. A new multiscale Stack Fusion method is introduced to further enhance reconstruction performance. It assigns higher weights to speech frames closer to the lost packets and lower weights to distant ones, enabling effective integration of global and local features across various time scales. Additionally, a tailored loss function is proposed to guide model training by balancing the numerical precision, structural periodicity, and perceptual fidelity. Objective and subjective evaluations consistently indicate that the proposed method sustains robust performance across varying packet loss rates and speaker variability, underscoring its enhanced generalization. The alignment of improvements across multiple evaluation metrics demonstrates that these advancements are architectural rather than dataset-specific. Notably, the proposed method reveals that integrating codec-internal parameters with multiscale temporal modeling provides intrinsic robustness than post-processing PLC methods. Furthermore, the proposed model requires only 0.16 Giga Multiply-Accumulate Operations per second, underscoring its strong potential for high-quality real-time speech communication applications.},

To address these issues, we extract text information via optical character recognition (OCR) and then generate the text features using the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT). Visual features of the image are extracted from the local and global features of the image using ResNet and Vision Transformer cascades, and then fused to generate the final hash sequence through the fully connected layer. The proposed network considers both image visual features and textual information to verify that the document image has not been tampered with. In our network, the OCR module enables accurate and intelligent text detection and recognition, particularly for dealing with text tampering that has only been conducted in tiny portions. It also provides more efficient and robust text recognition services. Experimental results show that the proposed hashing scheme is robust and discriminative in document images.},

Identifying covert channels in blockchain is necessary and important to design blockchain based covert communication schemes. However, there still lacks a systematical method to analyze all possible covert channels in blockchain applications. In the paper, we propose a layer based covert channel identification method to analyze both covert storage channels and covert timing channels in blockchain applications. 11, 15, 14 and 19 new covert channels are identified in Bitcoin, Zcash, Monero and Ethereum with the proposed method, which proves the effectiveness of the method. The method is general and can be applied to identify covert channels in other blockchain applications, which lays foundation for both practical covert communication with blockchain applications and covert communication detection research.},

  abstract = {In recommendation systems, the interactions between users and items are influenced by two factors: the user's conformity towards popular items and the user's real interest. Training individual user embeddings and item embeddings to capture these two factors can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendations. However, recommendation systems often exchange item embeddings with third-party servers, which may expose sensitive information to malicious attackers. Specifically, attackers can infer sensitive user information based on published item embeddings and partial public user information. In this paper, we first design a model inversion attack to analyze the influence of conformity item embeddings and interest item embeddings on privacy. This analysis reveals that different item embeddings have varying resistances against inversion attack. Based on the resistance levels of the two item embeddings, we propose a novel adaptive differential privacy protection method that enhances resistance against model inversion attacks while ensuring recommendation accuracy. We conduct experiments on three real datasets, and the results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in terms of both recommendation accuracy and resistance to inversion attack.},

In this paper, we present PB-TABL, a novel method for financial time-series forecasting that integrates the piggyback (PB) architecture with Temporal Attention-Augmented Bilinear Networks (TABL). The proposed PB-TABL architecture addresses the challenges of task-incremental learning, including catastrophic forgetting, concept drift, and computational efficiency. By adapting pre-trained models through binary masks, PB-TABL enables efficient reuse of models for new tasks, significantly reducing training time and computational costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through extensive experiments on large-scale Limit Order Book (LOB) data, where PB-TABL outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and overall computational efficiency. Our contributions include formulating the problem of adapting pre-trained neural networks to new financial data, introducing the PB-TABL architecture, and showing its advantages in handling time-series data with temporal dependencies while mitigating the risks of catastrophic forgetting and model degradation.

Prior methods primarily focus on learning target user representation by modeling contextual information from the historical retweet user sequence of a single cascade, overlooking the uncertainties that exist in both historical propagation trajectory and future diffusion trends. In this work, we propose DucDiff, a novel dual-consistent diffusion model for enhancing target user representation used for information diffusion prediction. DucDiff harnesses the distribution generation capability of the diffusion model to generate target user representations from a distributional perspective rather than a fixed vector. Specifically, it captures the multi-latent aspects (i.e., uncertainties) of target user representation from historical and future user sequences, respectively, using disentangled dual denoising modules. Additionally, a shared information bottleneck is designed for the cross-distillation of knowledge between the historical and future denoising modules, eliminating the performance gap between training and inference, while ensuring that future information can be implicitly introduced during the inference phase. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate that DucDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

Existing methods primarily rely on prediction or reconstruction errors, neglecting the valuable information within the variable dependencies. In this paper, we propose a variable dependency discrepancy-based Transformer (VDDFormer) for unsupervised MTS anomaly detection. VDDFormer comprises a variable correlation encoder, a temporal dependency encoder, and a reconstruction decoder. The variable correlation encoder capitalizes on a variable dependency attention mechanism, which employs self-attention to learn the global variable dependencies; meanwhile, the local variable dependencies are captured by the adaptive correlation matrix. The global and local variable dependencies are then used to compute the variable dependency discrepancy as a new intrinsic property to distinguish between normal and abnormal patterns. By integrating this new discrepancy with the reconstruction error, the model effectively enhances its anomaly differentiation capability. Extensive experiments on five real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that VDDFormer effectively and robustly detects group anomaly patterns by leveraging the variable dependency discrepancy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four out of the five datasets.},

To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a semantic query model for temporal knowledge graphs, TKGSQ-PM (Temporal Knowledge Graph Semantic Query based on Pre-trained Model). This model first identifies and extracts entity and temporal information from temporal knowledge graph queries and obtains corresponding temporal knowledge graph embedding information based on embedding methods. Then, it utilizes the pre-trained model DistilBERT to infer the true query intent from user input queries. Finally, it performs comprehensive sorting to return highquality query results. We conduct multiple experiments on three different datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

  abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated text has introduced significant security concerns, driving the need for reliable detection systems. However, recent studies reveal that neural network-based detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. To improve the robustness of such classifiers, a number of adversarial attack strategies have been developed, particularly in the context of text sentiment classification. Most existing adversarial attack methods focus on the semantics of individual words or sentences, often neglecting the broader contextual semantics of the entire text-particularly in the case of long AI-generated text. This limitation frequently results in adversarial examples that lack fluency and coherence. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Sentence-based Adversarial attack on AI-Generated Text detectors (SAGT), which generates linguistically fluent adversarial examples by inserting model-generated sentences into the original text. To ensure contextual semantic consistency, we extract important keywords from the original text-selected based on changes in the detector's confidence score-and incorporate them into the generated sentences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that adversarial examples crafted by SAGT can effectively evade AI-generated text detectors.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.},

This directly impacts the effectiveness of traffic flow prediction and road condition monitoring. Inspired by image restoration techniques, this study introduces the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance traffic data compensation. Firstly, to address the problem of converting traffic data into the traffic flow matrix of the road network, we propose the RoadNetIMatrix algorithm to generate the traffic flow matrix of the road network. This algorithm precisely captures traffic flow dynamics in road networks and provides a holistic representation of traffic states. Secondly, given the inherent spatio-temporal correlation in traffic data, we proposed a spatio-temporal collaborative mining component (STSSM). This component integrates the hidden temporal dependencies and spatial features of the mined traffic data into the GAN generator to improve the authenticity of the generated content and ensure the consistency of data compensation. Finally, addressing the influence of external characteristics of traffic data on data compensation results, an external information module based on a multi-head attention mechanism is constructed, which can effectively mine the influence of external factors of traffic data. Furthermore, spatio-temporal and external features are fused to further improve the accuracy of data compensation. Experiments show that the model has a higher accuracy of data compensation and a better generalization of the system in the case of multiple types or a high data loss rate.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) involves answering questions based not only on the given image, but also on external knowledge. Existing methods for knowledge-based VQA can be classified into two main categories: those that rely on external knowledge bases, and those that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge engines. However, the former approach heavily relies on the quality of information retrieval, introducing additional information bias to the entire system. And the latter approach suffers from the extremely high computational cost and the loss of image information. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called TAG that reformulates knowledge-based VQA as a contrastive learning problem. We innovatively propose a triple asymmetric paradigm, which aligns a lightweight text encoder to the image space with an extremely low training cost (0.0152B trainable parameters), and enhance its understanding ability on semantic granularity. TAG is both computation-efficient and effective, and we evaluate it on the knowledge-based VQA datasets, A-OKVQA, OK-VQA and VCR. The results show that TAG (0.387B) achieves the state-of-the-art performance when compared to methods using less than 1B parameters. Besides, TAG still shows competitive performance when compared to methods with LLM.},

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Entity in One Word (MEOW) model. This model ensures alignment at various levels, including text-image match alignment, feature alignment and distribution alignment. Specificially, the entity image filtering module utilizes a visual-language model to exclude unrelated images by aligning their captions with corresponding text descriptions. A pre-trained CLIP-based encoder is utilized for encoding dense semantic relationships, while a graph attention network based structure encoder handles sparse semantic relationships, yielding a comprehensive semantic representation and enhancing convergence speed. Additionally, a diffusion model is integrated to enhance denoising capabilities. The proposed MEOW further includes a distribution alignment module equipped with dense alignment constraint, integrity alignment constraint, and fusion fidelity constraint to effectively align multi-modal representations. Experiments on two public multi-modal knowledge graph datasets show that MEOW significantly improves link prediction performance.

Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.

For big datasets, especially with incremental updates over time such as backups and gathered data, deduplication makes data management faster and more efficient. While many existing deduplication systems use default expected chunk lengths such as 4 KB or 8 KB, they are suboptimal. Poorly optimized deduplication systems can significantly increase storage costs and network usage, making large datasets prohibitively expensive to manage. We present the design, implementation, and an empirical validation of our Deduplication Change-Estimation Analytical Model (DCAM) which predicts the performance of sliding window-based deduplication parameters on any given dataset, to be used for parameter optimization. Our empirical evaluation includes workloads based on source code (Linux kernel, Kubernetes, TensorFlow), open-research datasets (CORD-19), and articles (Wikipedia). Validated using both our system and the Destor deduplication system, a DCAM-based search finds deduplication parameters that require up to 3.8× less storage relative to a common baseline. DCAM Search optimizes parameters up to 19.8× faster than previously possible, and the size of the resulting deduplicated datasets are all within 5.15% of the best results found by searching using actual deduplication.},

However, current automated annotation methods remain limited: most approaches separately model either cell-cell similarities or gene-gene relationships, neglecting their synergistic effects, which leads to suboptimal accuracy and poor biological interpretability. To address this, we propose scProGraph, a prototype-guided graph neural network that jointly models cell type classification and functional gene subgraph discovery. By constructing a cell similarity graph and incorporating cell-type prototypes as prior anchors, our method simultaneously optimizes classification boundaries and the interpretability of gene subgraphs. Experiments on seven independent datasets spanning three disease categories demonstrate that scProGraph achieves over 90% accuracy on four datasets and exceeds 80% on six datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals that the gene subgraphs extracted by scProGraph for Macrophage, Fibroblast, and Monocyte cover 26.92%, 26.83%, and 22.22% of a protein-protein interaction networks dataset, respectively, validating the biological relevance of the identified gene modules.

  abstract = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to enable distributed learning without sharing sensitive data. However, FL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious clients inject malicious data during training to compromise the global model. Existing FL defenses suffer from the assumptions of independent and identically distributed (IID) model updates, asymptotic optimal error rate bounds, and strong convexity in the optimization problem. Hence, we propose a novel framework called Federated Learning Optimal Transport (FLOT) that leverages the Wasserstein barycentric technique to obtain a global model from a set of locally trained non-IID models on client devices. In addition, we introduce a loss function-based rejection (LFR) mechanism to suppress malicious updates and a dynamic weighting scheme to optimize the Wasserstein barycentric aggregation function. We provide the theoretical proof of the Byzantine resilience and convergence of FLOT to highlight its efficacy. We evaluate FLOT on four benchmark datasets: GTSRB, KBTS, CIFAR10, and EMNIST. The experimental results underscore the practical significance of FLOT as an effective defense mechanism against data poisoning attacks in FL while maintaining high accuracy and scalability. Also, we observe that FLOT serves as a robust client selection technique under no attack, which demonstrates its effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating genes and contributing to disease progression. CircRNAs can function as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby regulating gene expression and influencing disease outcomes. Identifying associations between circRNAs and miRNAs through computational methods enhances the understanding of complex disease mechanisms and offers a reliable tool for pre-selecting candidates for experimental validation. Existing models, however, are limited in their ability to capture either global or local node information, the prediction of circRNA and miRNA interactions is still challenging. In order to effectively deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework for predicting circRNA-miRNA interactions (CMIs), known as MuGNet-CMI, which leverages multi-head hybrid graph neural network and global high-order and local low-order information. The model employs the MetaPath2Vec algorithm to generate high-quality node embeddings within the circRNA-miRNA heterogeneous matrix. The multi-head dynamic attention mechanism, combined with GraphSAGE, is incorporated to efficiently capture both global high-order and local low-order node information. Additionally, we integrate neural aggregators into the multi-head dynamic attention mechanism to aggregate feature information from the captured nodes. Validation using three real datasets demonstrates that MuGNet-CMI delivers good performance in predicting CMIs, offering valuable insights to guide experimental research in gene regulation.},

This limitation restricts the practical deployment of synthesizers. In this paper, we present NetKG, an interpretable configuration synthesis tool.(i) NetKG leverages a knowledge graph as the intermediate representation for configurations, reformulating the configuration synthesis problem as a configuration knowledge completion task; (ii) NetKG regards network intents as query tasks that need to be satisfied in the current configuration space, achieving this through knowledge reasoning and completion; (iii) NetKG explains the synthesis process and the consistency between configuration and intent through the configuration knowledge involved in reasoning and completion. We show that NetKG can scale to realistic networks and automatically synthesize intent-compliant configurations for static routes, OSPF, and BGP. It can explain the consistency between configuration and intent at different granularities through a visual interface. Experimental results indicate that NetKG synthesizes configurations in 2 minutes for a network with up to 197 routers, which is 7.37x faster than the SMT-based synthesizer.},

  abstract     = {Traditional reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query schemes typically assume that users are available online in real-time for interactive key reception, overlooking scenarios where users might be offline. Moreover, existing privacy-preserving RkNN query schemes primarily focus on user features or spatial data, neglecting the significance of user reputation values. To address these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving resilient RkNN query scheme over encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data (PRRQ). Specifically, to mitigate the challenges posed by resilient online presence (i.e., non-real-time online) of users for interactive key reception, we incorporate a non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) protocol and the Diffie-Hellman two-party key exchange algorithm to propose a multi-party NIKE algorithm (2K-NIKE), facilitating non-interactive key reception for multiple users. Considering the privacy leakage issues, PRRQ encodes original multi-attribute data (i.e., spatial, feature, and reputation values) alongside query requests based on formalized criteria. Additionally, we integrate the proposed 2K-NIKE and the improved symmetric homomorphic encryption (iSHE) algorithms to encrypt them. Furthermore, catering to the requirements of ciphertext-based RkNN queries, we propose a private RkNN query eligibility-checking (PREC) algorithm and a private reputation-verifying (PRRV) algorithm, which validate the compliance of encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data with query requests. Security analysis demonstrates that PRRQ achieves simulation-based security under an honest-but-curious model. Experimental results show that PRRQ offers superior computational efficiency compared to comparative schemes.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires dependable operation in the presence of errors in the hardware (caused by for example radiation) as this has become a pressing concern. At the same time, the scale and complexity of LLMs limit the overhead that can be added to detect errors. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost error detection schemes. Concurrent Error Detection (CED) uses the properties of a system to detect errors, so it is an appealing approach. In this paper, we present a new methodology and scheme for error detection in LLMs: Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED). Its main principle is that the output of LLMs should be valid and generate coherent text; therefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from the normal text, it is likely that there is an error. Hence, errors can potentially be detected by checking the linguistic features of the text generated by LLMs. This has the following main advantages: 1) low overhead as the checks are simple and 2) general applicability, so regardless of the LLM implementation details because the text correctness is not related to the LLM algorithms or implementations. The proposed CLED has been evaluated on two LLMs: T5 and OPUS-MT. The results show that with a 1% overhead, CLED can detect more than 87% of the errors, making it suitable to improve LLM dependability at low cost.},

Due to resource constraints in software switches, sketches have emerged as a promising approach for network traffic measurement. However, their accuracy is often impacted by hash collisions. Existing hash functions treat all collisions equally, failing to account for the differing impacts of collisions involving elephant flows versus mouse flows. We propose FSA-Hash, a novel flow-size-aware hashing scheme that separates elephant flows from each other and from mouse flows, minimizing the most detrimental collisions. FSA-Hash is designed based on two insights: separating elephant flows from mouse flows avoids overestimating mouse flows, while separating elephant flows from each other enables accurate heavy-hitter detection. We implement FSA-Hash using machine learning models trained on network traffic data (LFSA-Hash), and also design a lightweight online variant (OLFSA-Hash) that learns the hash model solely from sketch queries on the software switch, obviating traffic collection overheads. Evaluations across four sketches and two tasks demonstrate FSA-Hash’s superior accuracy over standard hash functions. Moreover, OLFSA-Hash closely matches LFSA-Hash’s performance, making it an attractive option for adaptively refining the hash model without monitoring traffic.},

  abstract     = {Shared L1-memory clusters of streamlined instruction processors (processing elements - PEs) are commonly used as building blocks in modern, massively parallel computing architectures (e.g. GP-GPUs). Scaling out these architectures by increasing the number of clusters incurs computational and power overhead, caused by the requirement to split and merge large data structures in chunks and move chunks across memory hierarchies via the high-latency global interconnect. Scaling up the cluster reduces buffering, copy, and synchronization overheads. However, the complexity of a fully connected cores-to-L1-memory crossbar grows quadratically with PE-count, posing a major physical implementation challenge. We present TeraPool, a physically implementable, >1000 floating-point-capable RISC-V PEs scaled-up cluster design, sharing a Multi-MegaByte >4000-banked L1 memory via a low latency hierarchical interconnect (1-7/9/11 cycles, depending on target frequency). Implemented in 12nm FinFET technology, TeraPool achieves near-gigahertz frequencies (910MHz) typical, 0.80V/25 °C. The energy-efficient hierarchical PE-to-L1-memory interconnect consumes only 9-13.5 pJ for memory bank accesses, just 0.74-1.1× the cost of a FP32 FMA. A high bandwidth main memory link is designed to manage data transfers in/out of the shared L1, sustaining transfers at the full bandwidth of an HBM2E main memory. At 910MHz, the cluster delivers up to 1.89 single precision TFLOP/s peak performance and up to 200GFLOP/s/W energy efficiency (at a high IPC/PE of 0.8 on average) in benchmark kernels, demonstrating the feasibility of scaling a shared-L1 cluster to a thousand PEs, four times the PE count of the largest clusters reported in literature.},

This paper introduces a novel batch-ordered job-store scheduling model, where jobs in a batch are scheduled sequentially, with their operations allocated in a round-robin fashion across two scenarios. We establish that this problem is NP-hard and analyze it in both online and offline settings. In the online case, we first examine the exclusive scenario, where operations within the same job must be scheduled on different machines, and show that a load greedy (LG) algorithm achieves a tight competitive ratio of $2 - \frac{1}{m}$, with m representing the number of machines. Next, we consider the circular scenario, which requires maintaining the circular order of operations across ordered machines. In this context, we analyze potential anomalies in load distribution during local optimality achieved by the ordered load greedy (OLG) algorithm and provide bounds on the occurrence of these anomalies and the maximum load in each local scheduling round. In the offline case, we abstract each OLG scheduling process as a generalized circular sequence alignment (CSA) problem and develop a dynamic programming-based matching (DPM) algorithm to solve it. To further enhance load balancing, we develop a dynamic programming-based optimization (DPO) algorithm to schedule multiple jobs simultaneously in both scenarios. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of DPM for the CSA problem, and we validate the load balancing effectiveness of both online and offline algorithms using real traffic datasets. These theoretical findings and algorithmic implementations lay a solid groundwork for future practical advancements.},

  abstract     = {Distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds enables joint training of data located in different regions, alleviating the burden of transferring large volumes of training datasets, which greatly saves bandwidth. However, the limited capacity of WAN links slows down the inter-cloud communications, which significantly decelerates the synchronization of distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds. Besides, the multi-tenancy in clouds results in multiple training tasks running simultaneously, whose synchronizations consistently compete for the limited WAN bandwidth with each other, which further aggravates the training performance of each task. While existing works optimize synchronizations through techniques like gradient compression, multi-resource interleaving and so on, none of them targets at the synchronization congestion especially due to multi-tenant learning, which results in inferior training performance. To solve these problems, we propose a simple but effective scheme, SCC, for fast and efficient multi-tenant learning via synchronization congestion control. SCC monitors the cross-cloud network conditions and evaluates the synchronization congestion level based on the round-trip transmission time for each synchronization. Then SCC alleviates synchronization congestion via controlling the synchronization frequency according to the synchronization congestion level in a probabilistic way. Extensive experiments are conducted within our testbeds consisted of 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs to evaluate the performance of SCC, and comparison results show that SCC can reduce the average training completion time and makespan by up to 28.6% and 43.2% over SAP-SGD [1]. Targeted experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SCC.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are widely used for edge computing in poor infrastructure scenarios due to their deployment flexibility and mobility. In UAV-assisted edge computing systems, multiple UAVs can cooperate with the cloud to provide superior computing capability for diverse innovative services. However, many service-related computational tasks may fail due to the unreliability of UAVs and wireless transmission channels. Diverse solutions were proposed, but most of them employ timedriven strategies which introduce unwanted decision waiting delays. To address this problem, this paper focuses on a taskdriven reliability-aware cooperative offloading problem in UAV-assisted edge-enhanced networks. The issue is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV trajectories, offloading decisions, and transmission power, aiming to maximize the long-term average task success rate. Considering the discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the problem, a dependenceaware latent-space representation algorithm is proposed to represent discrete-continuous hybrid actions. Furthermore, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning scheme by combining the representation algorithm and a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. We compared our proposed algorithm with four alternative solutions via simulations and a realistic Kubernetes testbed-based setup. The test results show how our scheme outperforms the other methods, ensuring significant improvements in terms of task success rate.},

  abstract     = {Verifiable data streaming (VDS) is proposed to authenticate a sequence of ordered data, such that the misbehavior on the data returned by cloud server can be effectively detected. VDS also allows to efficiently replace the outsourced data by another value. However, the old authentication information can make the expired data pass the verification. To prevent this attack, VDS schemes must provide a revocation approach to revoke the old authentication information. The current approach employs the tree-like authentication structure or cryptographic accumulator, which will influence the efficiency of the VDS scheme. In this work, we find an approach to construct the low-storage VDS scheme supporting efficient revocation. Towards this end, we fully exploit the property of chameleon hash function with ephemeral trapdoor to propose a signature, which is the crucial step to construct the VDS scheme. In our VDS scheme, the size of the authentication information can be reduced to be less than the scale of the data streaming (i.e., low storage). Furthermore, the client is able to revoke the old authentication information in an efficient manner, where she only needs to release a message (i.e., efficient revocation). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VDS scheme is efficient and practical.},

  abstract     = {The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1× inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain enhances trust and collaboration among entities through its inherent features of transparency, immutability, and traceability, leading to its extensive integration into Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). However, existing transaction propagation mechanisms require MEC devices to consume significant computing resources for complex transaction verification, increasing their vulnerability to malicious attacks. Adversaries can exploit this by flooding the blockchain network with spam transactions, aiming to deplete device energy and disrupt system performance. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a reputation-based energy-efficient transaction propagation mechanism that alleviates spam transaction attacks while reducing computing resources and energy consumption. Firstly, we design a subjective logic-based reputation scheme that assesses node trust by integrating local and recommended opinions and incorporates opinion acceptance to counteract false evidence. Then, we optimize the transaction verification method by adjusting transaction discard and verification probabilities based on the proposed reputation scheme to curb the propagation of spam transactions and reduce verification consumption. Finally, we enhance the transaction transmission strategy by prioritizing nodes with higher reputations, enhancing both resilience to spam transactions and transmission reliability. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

To protect the confidentiality of sensitive information outsourced to cloud servers, much efforts have been devoted to designing geometric range query schemes over encrypted spatial data without affecting availability. However, existing works focus on the privacy-preserving schemes with traditional tree indexes, causing more computing and storage issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient conjunctive geometric range query scheme over encrypted spatial data with a learned index. In particular, we design a new privacy-preserving learned index for spatial data to reduce the search space and storage overhead. The main idea is to add noise disturbance to the objective function instead of directly adding it to output results, reducing the leakage of private information and ensuring the correctness of output results. Moreover, we propose a spatial segmentation algorithm to avoid accessing a large number of unnecessary Z codes in the query process. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme ensures index data security and query privacy. Simulation results show that the query efficiency is improved while the storage overhead is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and fast data stream mining is critical to many tasks, including real-time series analysis for mobile sensor data, big data management and machine learning. Various heavy-oriented item detection tasks, such as identifying heavy hitters, heavy changers, persistent items, and significant items, have garnered considerable attention from both industry and academia. Unfortunately, as data stream speeds continue to increase and the available memory, particularly in L1 cache, remains limited for real-time processing, existing schemes face challenges in simultaneously achieving high detection accuracy, memory efficiency, and fast update throughput, as we reveal. To tackle this conundrum, we propose a versatile and elegant sketch framework named Tight-Sketch, which supports a spectrum of heavy-based detection tasks. Recognizing that, in practice, most items are cold (non-heavy/persistent/significant), we implement distinct eviction strategies for different item types. This approach allows us to swiftly discard potentially cold items while offering enhanced protection to hot ones (heavy/persistent/significant). Additionally, we introduce an eviction method based on stochastic decay, ensuring that Tight-Sketch incurs only small one-sided errors without overestimation. To further enhance detection accuracy under extremely constrained memory allocations, we introduce Tight-Opt, a variant incorporating two optimization strategies. We conduct extensive experiments across various detection tasks to demonstrate that Tight-Sketch significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and update speed. Furthermore, by utilizing Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, we enhance Tight-Sketch’s update throughput by up to 36%. We also implement Tight-Sketch on FPGA to validate its practicality and low resource overhead in hardware deployments.},

Many efforts have been made to establish the quantifiable relationship between these metrics but it is less than optimal. This work addresses the flaws of the existing results and proposes a novel proof to determine the metric relationship between h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability under the PMC and MM* models. Our approach overcomes the defect of previous results by abandoning the network’s regularity and independence number. Furthermore, we apply the suggested metric to establish the h-extra diagnosability of a new network class, named generalized exchanged X-cube-like network GEXC(s, t), which takes dual-cube-like network, generalized exchanged hypercube, generalized exchanged crossed cube, and locally generalized exchanged twisted cube as special cases. Finally, we propose the h-extra diagnosis strategy (h-EDS) and design two self-diagnosis algorithms AhED-PMC and AhED-MM*, and then conduct experiments on GEXC(s, t) and the real-world network DD-g648 to show the high accuracy and superior performance of the proposed algorithms.},

This paper focuses on upper-bounding response times for tasks with both parallel execution and conditional execution using the multi-path technique. By designing a delicate abstraction regarding the multiple paths of various conditional branches, we derive a new response time bound. We further apply this response time bound into the scheduling of multiple parallel tasks with conditional branches. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed bound significantly advances the state-of-the-art, reducing the response time bound by 9.4% and improving the schedulability by 31.2% on average.},

In addition, multiple-precision multipliers are in high demand for efficient NN accelerators; therefore, recursive multipliers used in low-precision fusion schemes are gaining increasing attention. In this work, we design exact recursive multipliers based on customized approximate full adders (AFAs) for low-power purposes. Initially, the partial products (PPs) encoded by 2×2 multiplications are analyzed, which reveals the correlations among adjacent PPs. Based on these correlations, we propose 4×4 recursive multiplier architectures where certain full adders (FAs) can be simplified without affecting the correctness of the multiplication. Manually and synthesis tool-based FA simplifications are performed separately. The obtained 4×4 multipliers are then used to construct 8×8 multipliers based on a low-power recursive architecture. Finally, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 and 8×8 multipliers are evaluated using a 28nm CMOS technology. Compared with DesignWare (DW) multipliers, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 multipliers achieve power reductions of 16.5% and 11.6%, respectively, without compromising area or delay; alternatively, the delay can be reduced by 20.9% and 39.4%, respectively, without compromising power or area. For signed and unsigned 8×8 multipliers, the maximum power reductions are 9.7% and 13.7%, respectively, albeit with a trade-off in area.},

We present STAGEWISE, an CPU-efficient key-value store on fast NVMe SSDs with high throughput. To achieve this, we introduce a new thread model for StageWise to process KV requests. Specifically, STAGEWISE converts the processing of each KV request into multiple asynchronous stages, and thus enables pipelining across all stages. STAGEWISE further introduces a client-driven share-index architecture to ease inter-thread load imbalance and maximize the pipelining opportunity. Guided by Little’s Law, STAGEWISE improves concurrency, and therefore efficiently uses CPU to reach higher throughput. Extensive experimental results show that STAGEWISE outperforms CPUoptimized key-value stores (e.g., KVell) by up to 3.5× with writeintensive workloads, and storage-optimized ones (e.g., RocksDB) by over an order of magnitude. STAGEWISE also shows higher read performance and excellent scalability under various workloads.},

In applications where sorting has to be efficiently accomplished (i.e., in O(1) time) on small-sized entries, hardware accelerators, such as ASICs, FPGAs, or GPUs, are used to speed up the sorting operations. In the literature, the bitonic sort algorithm (or variants thereof) is still considered to be the most commonly used approach in many hardware sort implementations for decades. However, the time complexity of the bitonic sort is O((log(n))2) for sorting n elements, which does not satisfy the constant-time constraint we demand for our setting. In this paper, we propose competition-style sorting networks (CSNs), a framework for designing hardware-based competition-style class of sorting networks that captures all forms of two-stage sorting networks where the first stage (competition) consists of pairwise comparisons and the second stage (evaluation) ranks the entries and sorts them. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we develop and test one instance of this design, called the Competition Sort Algorithm (CSA), which has a time complexity of O(1), and specifically, one clock cycle. We implemented and tested CSA on both an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and the NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU then measured its gain, which combines the trade-offs between the relative speedup and the relative area increase, against the bitonic sort. Our results show that the CSA achieves a significant gain of up to 11.01× on the FPGA and a relative speedup of up to 3.32× on the GPU. We also compare the area, power, and latency of CSA with the bitonic sort algorithm on the FPGA.},

Many concurrent inference requests and intricate DNN models demand efficient multi-DNN inference in MEC networks. However, the resource-limited IoT device/edge server and expanding model size force models to be dynamically deployed, resulting in significant undesired energy consumption. In addition, parallel multi-DNN inference on the same device complicates the inference process due to the resource competition among models, increasing the inference latency. In this paper, we propose a Resource-aware and Dynamic DNN Deployment (R3D) scheme with the collaboration of end-edge-cloud. To mitigate resource competition and waste during multi-DNN parallel inference, we develop a Resource Adaptive Management (RAM) algorithm based on the Roofline model, which dynamically allocates resources by accounting for the impact of device-specific performance bottlenecks on inference latency. Additionally, we design a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based online optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts DNN deployment strategies to achieve fast and energy-efficient inference across heterogeneous devices. Experiment results demonstrate that R3D is applicable in MEC environments and performs well in terms of inference latency, resource utilization, and energy consumption.},

Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g. 28nm CPU, whereas a product instance can be made in various regions and time periods. Carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a product instance can differ from its product class. Additionally, different carbon attribution methods (e.g., location-based and market-based) can affect the carbon emissions of electricity, thus further affecting the embodied carbon of products. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) accounting models with dual attribution methods. We observe significant differences between STEC and current models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference is 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) training and LLM inference. We observe that using STEC results in much greater differences in the embodied carbon of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%).},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by training models on edge client devices using their local data without revealing their raw data. In edge environments, various applications require different neural network models, making it crucial to perform joint training of multiple models on edge devices, known as multi-task FL. While existing multi-task FL approaches enhance resource utilization on edge devices through adaptive resource configuration or client selection, optimizing either of these aspects alone may lead to suboptimality. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a joint client selection and resource configuration method called JCSRC for multi-task FL, aiming to maximize energy efficiency in environments with limited computation and communication resources and heterogeneous client devices. Firstly, we formalize this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem considering all these characteristics and prove its NP-hardness. To address this problem, we first design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based client selection method that selects appropriate clients for each task to train their models. The MARL method makes client selection decisions based on the clients’ data quality, energy efficiency, communication, and computation capacity to ensure fast convergence and energy efficiency. Then, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based resource configuration scheme that configures appropriate computation and bandwidth resources for each task on each client. The PSO scheme makes resource configuration decisions based on theoretically derived optimal CPU frequency and bandwidth to achieve high energy efficiency. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments to validate our proposed JCSRC. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, JCSRC can save energy consumption by up to 59% to achieve the target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance demands and stringent timing requirements of safety-critical systems like avionics and autonomous vehicles, research has focused on providing timing guarantees for the scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks in multicore systems. The structural complexity and timing anomalies make this problem challenging. Existing methods bound the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks through static analysis, but these bounds are complicated, difficult to validate, and often remain pessimistic for many scheduling scenarios. Runtime intervention can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is ineffective for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leads to non-work-conserving schedules, and incurs additional overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to identify timing anomalies in DAG scheduling scenarios within a system, providing tighter WCRT solutions. The static analysis first offers a sufficient anomaly test to directly identify some anomaly-free DAG scheduling scenarios. Leveraging a wide range of scheduling data collected from the running system or its simulator, we then apply a machine learning approach to train a binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of 99.5%. Identifying the anomaly status enables the application of more precise WCRT bounds for different scheduling scenarios, leading to improved system performance. Specifically, we shorten the WCRT bounds for anomaly-free DAG scheduling by an average of up to 21.58%, with a maximum reduction of up to 55.47% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {RowHammer poses a serious reliability challenge to modern DRAM systems. As technology scales down, DRAM resistance to RowHammer has decreased by 30× over the past decade, causing an increasing number of benign applications to suffer from this issue. However, existing defense mechanisms have three limitations: 1) they rely on inefficient mitigation techniques, such as time-consuming victim row refresh; 2) they do not reduce the number of effective RowHammer attacks, leading to frequent mitigations; and 3) they fail to recognize that frequently accessed data is not only a root cause of RowHammer but also presents an opportunity for performance optimization. In this paper, we observe that frequently accessed hot data plays a distinct role in security and efficiency: it can induce RowHammer by interfering with adjacent cold data, while also being performance-critical due to its frequent accesses. To this end, we propose Data Isolation via In-DRAM Cache (DIVIDE), a novel defense mechanism that leverages in-DRAM cache to isolate and exploit hot data. DIVIDE offers three key benefits: 1) It reduces the number of effective RowHammer attacks, as hot data in the cache cannot interfere with each other. 2) It provides a simple yet effective mitigation measure by isolating hot data from cold data. 3) It caches frequently accessed hot data, improving average access latency. DIVIDE employs a two-level protection structure: the first level mitigates RowHammer in cache arrays with high efficiency, while the second level addresses the remaining threats in normal arrays to ensure complete protection. Owing to the high in-DRAM cache hit rate, DIVIDE efficiently mitigates RowHammer while preserving both the performance and energy efficiency of the in-DRAM cache. At a RowHammer threshold of 128, DIVIDE with probabilistic mitigation achieves an average performance improvement of 19.6% and energy savings of 20.4% over DDR4 DRAM for fourcore workloads. Compared to an unprotected in-DRAM cache DRAM, DIVIDE incurs only a 2.1% performance overhead while requiring just a modest 1KB per-channel CAM in the memory controller, with no modification to the DRAM chip.},

  abstract     = {Abstract—Asynchronous common subset (ACS) is a powerful paradigm enabling applications such as Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) and multi-party computation (MPC). The most efficient ACS framework in the information-theoretic setting is due to Ben-Or, Kelmer, and Rabin (BKR, 1994). The BKR ACS protocol has been both theoretically and practically impactful. BKR ACS has an O(log $n$) running time (where $n$ is the number of replicas) due to the usage of $n$ parallel asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances, impacting both performance and scalability. Indeed, for a network of 16∼64 replicas, the parallel ABA phase occupies about 95%∼97% of the total runtime. A long-standing open problem is whether we can build an ACS framework with O(1) time while not increasing the message or communication complexity of the BKR protocol. We resolve the open problem, presenting the first constant-time ACS protocol with O($n$3) messages in the information-theoretic and signature-free settings. Our key ingredient is the first information-theoretic and constant-time multivalued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol. Our results can improveߞasymptotically and concretelyߞvarious applications using ACS and MVBA. As an example, we implement FIN, a BFT protocol instantiated using our framework. Via a 121-server deployment on Amazon EC2, we show FIN reduces the overhead of the ABA phase to as low as 1.23% of the total runtime.},

Compared to Linux, we achieve an average speedup of 3.5× and a maximum of up to 15.4×. We also achieve an average code size reduction of 84% and a maximum of up to 90%. By moving application code from user space to kernel space, an additional code size reduction up to 56% and a speedup up to 1.3× can be achieved. Compared to FreeRTOS, the use of Miosix only costs a moderate amount of code size (at most 47KB) for significant advantages in application performance with speedups averaging at 1.5× and up to 5×.},

We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT).

To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement.

However, SS-DFER faces two main problems, ambiguity in facial semantics caused by noisy labels and poor feature representation capabilities of models. In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER method based on Semantic-level and Instance-Level information Interactive Mining, namely SILIM, to simultaneously address both problems. Specifically, the model generates pseudo-labels for semantics and instances through the interaction of semantic and instance information, achieving matching at both levels to fully exploit image feature information. In addition, we construct a memory buffer that stores all instances of labeled data, enabling interaction between semantic pseudo-labels and instance pseudo-labels.

  abstract     = {Object reconstruction utilizes multi-view information to capture the three-dimensional geometry of objects. High-precision scanners used in object reconstruction face challenges, including a narrow field of view, shallow sensing depth, and self-occlusion. Hence, this study proposes a novel Next-Best-View (NBV) selection algorithm called a Poisson-informed Transformer for NBV (PIT-NBV). The algorithm combines the strengths of both Poisson reconstruction-based and deep learning-based approaches. Our framework introduces a 6-Degree of Freedom (DOF) NBV selection mechanism, designed to enhance surface detail capture and mitigate self-occlusion, unlike previous deep learning approaches that operate within 2-DOF spherical view spaces. The proposed method incorporates a View Constraint Block (VCB) to ensure collision-free 6-DOF viewpoint selection and high-quality data for sensors with limited sensing depths. Additionally, we introduce Point Cloud Transformer-View (PCTV), an enhanced PCT specifically tailored for efficient NBV search. Experimental evaluations conducted on the ShapeNet, Stanford, and MIT CSAIL datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The proposed method achieved reconstruction quality comparable to Poisson reconstructionbased approaches, offering inference speeds more than 50 times faster. In addition to synthetic benchmarks, real-world experiments using a high-precision structured light scanner and robotic manipulator demonstrate the feasibility of deploying PIT-NBV in real-world applications. These results suggest that PIT-NBV has the potential for applications in robotic vision, automated inspection, and digital archiving, where rapid and accurate 3D reconstruction is essential.},

  abstract     = {Real-world robot manipulation in dynamic unstructured environments requires lifelong adaptability to evolving objects, scenes and tasks. Traditional imitation learning relies on static training paradigms, which are ill-suited for lifelong adaptation. Although Continual Imitation Learning (CIL) enables incremental task adaptation while preserving learned knowledge, current CIL methods primarily overlook the intrinsic skill characteristics of robot manipulation or depend on manually defined and rigid skills, leading to suboptimal cross-task knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose Skill Prompts-based HiErarchical Continual Imitation Learning (SPECI), a novel end-to-end hierarchical CIL policy architecture for robot manipulation. The SPECI framework consists of a multimodal perception and fusion module for heterogeneous sensory information encoding, a high-level skill inference module for dynamic skill extraction and selection, and a low-level action execution module for precise action generation. To enable effective knowledge transfer on both skill and task levels, SPECI performs continual implicit skill acquisition and reuse via an expandable skill codebook and an attention-driven skill selection mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Mode Approximation to augment the last two modules with task-specific and task-shared parameters, thereby enhancing task-level knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on diverse manipulation task suites demonstrate that SPECI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across all evaluated metrics, revealing exceptional bidirectional knowledge transfer and superior overall performance.

Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal–dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation (CCV) are achieved if the path–length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal {O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}})$ network CCV bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4})$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}})$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions.

To overcome this limitation, this article presents a fully distributed algorithm that enables a multi-robot team to explore cooperatively while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The core of our approach is a framework where each robot individually trains a sparse Bayesian classifier using its local LiDAR data to probabilistically model unsafe regions. To achieve collaborative awareness, the robots exchange these compact, learned models, not high-volume raw data, and fuse them to construct a shared safety map. Safety is then formally guaranteed through a control barrier function (CBF) derived from this collaborative map. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through both simulations and experiments with physical ground robots.},

Despite extensive research efforts, traditional mitigation approaches have fallen short, largely due to their narrow focus on detection accuracy while overlooking the social and emotional influences that drive user behavior. This article proposes to frame information belief as a social norm, enabling us to track and predict its evolution at the individual user level. By operating on an individual level, we can identify and target specific users susceptible to adopting certain norms ahead of time, providing a more powerful approach to mitigating the effects of misinformation. To accomplish this, we develop a temporal graph neural network equipped with projection operators capable of forecasting arbitrary time horizons. The network is trained to predict individual users’ tipping points—the moments when they transition from resistance to acceptance of particular information norms. We conduct rigorous analysis of the temporal smoothness of our predictions, leading to an algorithm that queries the model to identify critical moments before users reach their tipping points, enabling preemptive action. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at predicting individual tipping points in real-world information networks, marking a significant advance in our ability to address misinformation through preventive rather than reactive measures.},

To achieve precise and long-term prediction of complex indoor human behaviors, this article proposes a novel method for behavior prediction with attention mechanism (BPAM), designed to predict users’ behavioral models while enabling timely detection of abnormal behaviors. Specifically, 1) we use passive infrared (PIR) sensors to capture the trajectory of a person moving indoors every day and model it as a directed graph; 2) we use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture the features of a person’s daily behavior patterns and fuse the temporal information into the features; and 3) we develop an inference module that combines attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer behavior patterns for the next days.

  abstract     = {Research on overlapping community detection is still significant due to the rapid growth of different types of complex networks. Among the types of community detection, density-based clustering approaches did not get much attention in the field of overlapping community detection. We found two main drawbacks of the density-based approaches: 1) lack of research in computing the proper long-range distance (up to several hops) among the nodes in graph dataset; and 2) difficulty in computing overlapping belonging coefficients of the nodes in terms of diverse and irregular shaped clusters of graph datasets where distances among few nodes are available only (even not the positions of the nodes). In this article, we propose a novel overlapping community detection approach which we term as “density-based fuzzy community detection (DFCD)”, based on local densities of the nodes. Here, we capture the network topology in the form of bulk node-streams (node sampling) by employing biased random walk. We propose a novel way to compute long range distances among the nodes by utilizing the nodes-streams to find fixed number of global neighbors for each node, and accordingly we compute local densities of the nodes. We propose three relations between nodes and communities, where local densities and distances among the nodes are known only. Finally, we propose a novel belonging computation function based on the three relations, local densities, distances among the nodes. Our proposed approach is judged considering a number of real-life and synthetic datasets, where we consider ten state-of-the-art competitors. The experimental analysis shows superiority of the proposed approach over its competitors based on both accuracy and quality evaluations. Moreover, the detailed complexity analysis of the proposed approach shows linearly growth of the time complexity in terms of number of nodes and average degree, which is less than the same of majority overlapping community detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have proven effective at capturing complex relationships in graphs with diverse node and edge types. However, centralized training in HGNNs raises privacy concerns, as sensitive data can be exposed during model training. This risk is further exacerbated when the data is distributed across multiple clients. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling collaborative training without sharing local data. However, existing FL methods for heterogeneous graphs fail to effectively address challenges such as data imbalance and the handling of private edge types. Moreover, existing methods designed for homogeneous graphs are ineffective at addressing the data sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs. In this article, we propose FedHeGA, a FL framework for heterogeneous graphs that enhances node classification performance while preserving privacy. We tackle data imbalance by integrating heterogeneous graph reconstruction with differential autoencoders to generate semantically coherent node features, improving feature propagation in sparse or imbalanced data. To preserve privacy, we propose a parameter decomposition mechanism that uploads only edge-type-independent global parameters, protecting sensitive local data. Additionally, we address dataset skewness by employing a contrastive learning strategy to align local and global model parameters, which enhances convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that FedHeGA significantly outperforms existing methods on node classification benchmarks, offering an effective solution for federated heterogeneous graph learning.},

  abstract     = {Influencer marketing involves brands partnering with influencers to promote products, often through combined text and image posts on social media platforms. This multimodal data is critical for identifying suitable products for effective marketing practice. In this study, we presented MMInfluencer, a novel framework that addressed the critical upstream challenge of knowledge extraction from unstructured multimodal social media data. Our framework operationalized communication theories, the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and dual coding theory (DCT), to guide large language models (LLMs) in constructing a high-quality knowledge graph (KG) from the multimodal posts and biographies of 1000 Instagram influencers. Human assessment of the KG confirmed its relevance and completeness with accuracy scores of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. We then examined the KG’s efficacy in various influencer marketing tasks using graph-based learning methods and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. The KG derived from multimodal data significantly improved product category prediction and recommendation tasks, with the Node2Vec model showing improvements of 20.47% (AUROC, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) and 1142.15% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001), respectively. In contrast, the RAG method was ineffective, yielding an accuracy of just 0.1195 ($\pm$ 0.0162). Furthermore, the LLM-extracted KG significantly improved performance in challenging scenarios, where the best model achieved improvements of 155.51% (NDCG@20, p $=$ 0.0170) for emerging influencers (zero-shot) and 1144.51% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) for influencers with scarce data (cold-start). Our research underscores the potential of leveraging multimodal data, LLMs, and graph-based learning methods for effective influencer marketing.},

  abstract     = {Socio-psychological studies have identified a common phenomenon where an individual’s public actions do not necessarily coincide with their private opinions, yet most existing models fail to capture the dynamic interplay between these two aspects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents’ personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework’s potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has received attention to solve the cold-start and data sparsity problems. Existing methods mainly focus on the information about overlapping users or items, neglecting to effectively and efficiently utilize the information about nonoverlapping users or items in the source domain. Currently, graph prompt learning is proposed to bridge the gap between the pretrained tasks and downstream tasks, which can fully use the information of the source domain. However, existing graph prompt based CDR methods are rare and solely focus on the user-item interaction graphs without considering extra auxiliary information. Therefore, in this article, we construct knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information and propose a novel knowledge-aware graph prompt tuning for CDR (KGP-CDR) model. First, the KGs of the source and target domains are constructed, respectively, and a graph encoder is pretrained on the KG of the source domain. In addition, two types of graph prompts are designed: soft graph prompts and personalized graph prompts. These prompts are finetuned in the target domain along with the pretrained graph encoder. Ultimately, the predicted rating can be acquired through the finetuned graph prompts. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

We propose a viewpoint-based network evolution model that simulates structural transformations driven by user preferences. To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the hidden comment area cocoon (H-CAC)—a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading model, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining recommendation accuracy as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emotional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a major contributor to the global disease burden and is closely associated with variations in facial expressions, making them a critical biomarker for its recognition. Traditional local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN) rely on fixed binary weights, which fail to capture complex and nuanced features, limiting their adaptability and generalization. Existing methods often lack extracting spatial hierarchies and model long-range dependencies within facial expressions. To address these gaps, an enhanced random binary multilevel attention network (ERBMA-Net) is proposed for facial depression recognition, which employs a multibranch architecture to extract global (face) and local (eyes and mouth) features. Subsequently, the enhanced random binary convolutional neural network (ERBCNN) introduces random binary filters and a refinement layer to improve adaptability over LBCNN. Furthermore, multilevel attention mechanisms, including spatial attention are applied independently to global and local features and self-attention on concatenated features to capture critical spatial and relational patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge 2014 (AVEC2014) and the Changzhou No. 2 People’s Hospital (CZ2024) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ERBMA-Net, achieving mean absolute error and root mean square error: 6.80/8.18 and 6.37/8.08, respectively. These results establish ERBMA-Net as a robust framework for artificial intelligence-assisted mental health diagnostics. The code is available at: https://github.com/DrTuryalai/ERBMA-Net.},

Consequently, the market for these models has expanded exponentially, with platforms emerging to facilitate secure transactions and collaborations between model developers and end users. However, this convenience has also given rise to significant challenges, particularly copyright infringement and ownership conflicts. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, DeepVerifier, which integrates black-box and white-box watermarking. Cryptographic hash functions (SHA) and chaotic maps are utilized to generate a unique secret message. This message, called the watermark, is then divided into $k$ blocks. We determine the optimal embedding locations as the model parameters with the lowest gradient weights, after which the blocks are imperceptibly concealed within selected weights. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeepVerifier, we assess the watermarked model in both black-box and white-box scenarios on the receiver’s end. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepVerifier enables two-stage ownership verification of notable models against various attacks while deteriorating the original task accuracy by less than 0.5% on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a method for the copyright protection of deep neural network (DNN) models using the lowest-gradient-based embedding of a generated fused watermark and two-stage ownership verification via watermarking.},

Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis methods can no longer meet the processing requirements of such multisource heterogeneous data, which makes multimodal sentiment analysis a research hotspot. However, most existing methods rely on simple feature splicing or weighted fusion, neglecting the differences in the reliability of different modalities and failing to fully explore the intermodality consistency and difference information. In this article, we propose a multimodal competitive fusion mechanism and construct multimodal competitive fusion model (MCFM). The model first dynamically evaluates the reliability of each modality through the competition mechanism and adaptively assigns weights accordingly. Then it decomposed the modality representations into similar and dissimilar features through modality feature decomposition, supplemented by the overlap of orthogonal traffic channel attention constraints, to achieve the collaborative learning of consistency and dissimilarity features. We evaluate the proposed model on several datasets. In our experiments, we used textual modality data from the dataset with audio modality data for the experiments. The experimental results show that MCFM has 2%–3% higher binary accuracy (ACC2) than the baseline model on the sentiment classification task (with 2% higher binary accuracy under the negative/nonnegative metrics and 3% higher binary accuracy under the positive/negative metrics), and that on the regression task, MCFM’s mean absolute error on the test dataset is 3% lower than that of the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {The identification of key nodes in multilayer networks has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, existing approaches often neglect two critical aspects: overlapping community structures and the heterogeneity of network layers. In practice, multilayer networks with overlapping communities more accurately capture the complexities of real-world systems, where nodes typically belong to multiple communities and may act as bridges between them, facilitating intercommunity interactions. Simultaneously, the impact of each network layer on node importance varies due to differences in topology and semantics, yet many existing studies assume uniformity across layers. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel model for key node identification in heterogeneous multilayer networks with overlapping communities, termed overlapping communities and layer heterogeneity (OCLH). First, OCLH constructs a multilayer network model that explicitly incorporates overlapping community structures. It then introduces a community influence metric and employs overlapping modular centrality to segment each layer into local subnetworks and a global subnetwork. This segmentation enables the quantification of both local and global node influence. Next, OCLH calculates the intralayer influence of a node by considering its affiliated communities and the subnetworks it participates. Furthermore, the model evaluates the heterogeneity across layers by measuring each layer’s structural distinctiveness and its contribution to the overall network, thereby assigning an adaptive importance score to each layer. Finally, the overall node impact is computed by integrating the node’s intralayer influence with its corresponding layer-wise significance. Overall, the OCLH algorithm enhances key node identification by jointly modeling overlapping communities and interlayer heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on two synthetic and ten real-world datasets demonstrate that the nodes identified by OCLH exhibit superior performance in terms of diffusion capability and their impact on network connectivity, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

This trend aims to expedite the development of feature-rich Mashup applications while simultaneously reducing time and costs. However, the growing abundance of Web APIs presents a challenge in service discovery. Consequently, Web API recommendation is proposed as a vital strategy for facilitating service discovery. Nonetheless, existing approaches to Web API recommendation suffer from limitations in effectively extracting rich semantics from description documents and service networks, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue, this article proposes trustworthy contrastive learning (TCL) for Web API recommendation via exploring textual and structural semantics, named TCL. TCL takes the trustworthiness of both the textual and structural representations into account to differentiate the loss of contrastive learning so that both textual and structural representation learning can be mutually improved.

We propose a next-POI recommendation model based on graph structure and sequential pattern to address these limitations. The model generates graph representations that reflect the real-time preferences of users by extracting local structures from a global POI graph. In addition, we design a temporal-aware self-attentive graph convolutional network and a channel attention mechanism to capture the structural features of users’ sequential visitation tendencies and the latent feature-channel relationships between POIs, respectively. These components enhance the ability of the model to characterize dynamic user preferences and behavioral changes.

  abstract     = {In this work, we expand the multicalibration fairness metric to graph-structured data. Machine learning models, including graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated to generate unfair results when trained on data containing biases towards certain demographic groups. Consequently, several fairness enhancing methods have been proposed to deal with such biases in the model predictions. To evaluate the performance of these methods, metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds have been proposed, which aim to ensure equal treatment across groups. However, these metrics do not take into consideration the diverse underlying distribution of the data across the different demographic groups. Hence, fairness is only achieved at the cost of utility. Multicalibration, on the other hand, aims to generate calibrated predictions for each group, thereby providing much stronger fairness guarantees. However, multicalibration is only defined for tabular data. Consequently, in this work, we provide a novel formulation of multicalibration fairness metric for graph-structured data, specifically for the task of link prediction. We demonstrate that the existing fairness enhancing methods are unable to achieve multicalibration, which leads us to define a simple quadratic program-based postprocessing method. Experiments across several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming the existing approaches. Our method is model agnostic and can seamlessly adapt to scenarios with single or multiple sensitive attributes.},

  abstract     = {Misinformation detection in social networks faces challenges due to complex semantics, scarcity of labeled data, and rapidly evolving false narratives. To address these issues, we present large language model (LLM)-augmented contrastive learning (LACL), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with contrastive learning (CL) for robust and accurate misinformation detection. We begin with an LLM-driven social media data augmentation strategy, utilizing prompt orchestration to generate diverse yet semantically consistent misinformation samples. These augmented samples are integrated into a CL-based detector, where the semantic richness and diversity introduced by the LLM enhance the CL’s discriminative feature extraction and predictive capability, thus improving generalization beyond the original training data. To align with CL’s discriminative goal, we develop a contrastive loss-aware joint training and fine-tuning approach where CL’s discriminative feature learning actively constrains the LLM’s hallucinations and guides the quality of augmentation. Through this closed-loop optimization, the CL-based detector progressively absorbs latent semantic knowledge from the LLM, effectively overcoming semantic complexity and reducing erroneous generations. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (Twitter15, Twitter16, Weibo, and PHEME) demonstrate that LACL outperforms mainstream deep learning methods and surpasses approaches that apply commercial LLMs for detection without task-specific adaptation. These results hold consistently across different backbone LLMs (qwen and llama), highlighting LACL’s enhanced robustness, adaptability to varying language contexts, and superior generalization capability.},

Extending the bounded confidence model, we simulate heterogeneous bot strategies along two dimensions: activeness and interaction preference. We introduce three distortion metrics including entropy, tendency, and polarization to quantify systemic effects. Simulations on scale-free networks show that even 5–15% bot presence can significantly alter opinion patterns, increasing fragmentation, bias, and convergence time, and random interaction strategies were found to generate consistently higher entropy, tendency, and polarization across various bot ratios, and moderate bot activeness (around 2–3 times that of humans) achieved peak distortion before diminishing returns set in. Validation using a real-world Twitter/X dataset confirms alignment between simulated and actual bot behavior. Findings suggest bot influence stems from behavioral nuance rather than volume, underscoring the need for detection mechanisms targeting dynamic interaction patterns.

Our analysis addresses four scenarios: convergent and divergent expectations, each under conditions of both nonrisk- and risk-sharing. The Quantum Bargaining Game, modeled as an agent-based model, is augmented using a machine learning technique, specifically employing the random forest regressor. Our model demonstrates that in a quantum environment, the bargaining solutions are both stable and balanced, aligning with generalized Nash solutions. This alignment is influenced by key factors such as the minimum edge weight threshold within the network and the degree of quantum entanglement. The results provide evidence of a consistent convergence toward a fixed point that incorporates agents’ outside options, signifying a transition from quantum-enhanced consensus-building to classical strategic solution. This shift, driven by the process of decoherence, underscores the need for institutions to replicate the coordination benefits once facilitated by quantum mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Social media facilitates information sharing but also enables the spread of fake news, which erodes social trust and compromises public safety. Detecting fake news is thus essential for social media supervision. Compared with fake news detection methods that rely on textual content and social context, methods that only leveraging propagation structure features exhibit distinct strengths. However, they face challenges including high computational complexity, limited ability to uncover propagation mechanisms, and low detection accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient fake news detection method based on propagation motifs, which not only uncovers the mechanisms of information spread but also achieves high detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a 3–5 node propagation motif family and design a higher-order motif counting algorithm to reduce computational complexity in fake news detection. We then define higher-order propagation motif degree features, analyzing two types of three-node motif degrees to distinguish between true and fake news propagation patterns. Results indicate that real news primarily follows a broadcast propagation pattern, while fake news relies more on a viral propagation pattern. Finally, we propose the multiorder propagation Motif degree (MPMD) method, which incorporates features derived from 3-to 5-node propagation motif degrees. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.},

However, most existing control approaches require online approximation models and associated a priori assumptions. In order to avoid the necessity of deriving online models, this article proposes a data-driven backstepping control (DBC) approach for a class of strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics. First, unlike the widely-studied adaptive backstepping control approaches, we identify the unknown dynamics of each subsystem based on off-line data and develop a data-driven continuous-time Lyapunov equation return controller, ensuring semi-global exponential stability of the error system. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven dynamic surface control (DDSC) approach for the “complexity explosion” problem in DBC. This approach uses a data-driven LMI to return the controller, ensuring that the error system remains semi-globally UUB, even when the derivative of the virtual controller cannot be calculated. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of DBC and DDSC are verified by simulation examples.},

To further mitigate the impact of maliciously injected data and improve estimation robustness, a TVSM-based estimator is developed, which employs an adaptive threshold to confine abnormal data within an acceptable range. In addition, a PSO algorithm is employed to fine-tune design parameters, thereby reducing the conservativeness of linear matrix inequality conditions.

Specifically, the parameters of local models’ shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, CL is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge. Additionally, to ensure fairness for clients with scarce data, FedCoSR introduces adaptive local aggregation to coordinate the global model involvement in each client. Our simulations demonstrate FedCoSR’s effectiveness in mitigating label heterogeneity by achieving accuracy and fairness improvements over existing methods on datasets with varying degrees of label heterogeneity.},

To this end, a resilient source seeking algorithm is proposed by designing an auxiliary point for each agent such that the coordination problem is transformed into a point tracking one. A reference velocity is calculated to guide benign robots toward the source, leveraging their historically optimal positions with the highest signal strength. This ensures the auxiliary points converge to the source, clustering benign robots nearby. When DoS attacks occur on some edges, the latest sampling data acquired before the attacks is used to hold the control signals for the robots. Then, sufficient conditions are established through rigorous stability analysis. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed approach extends the safe-kernel-based resilient consensus algorithms to a resilient source seeking algorithm for a general discrete-time second-order dynamics, while also can withstand a mixed cyberattack comprising both misbehaving and DoS attacks.

However, the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances inevitably leads to unknown faults in WWTP, making it challenging for fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using existing fault data to ensure continuous safe and stable operation. To address this issue, a knowledge compensation-based active fault-tolerant control (KC-AFTC) is designed in this article. First, a knowledge-based prescribed performance function (KPPF) is introduced to constrain the transient and steady-state performance of WWTP. Then, the proposed KPPF can assist in KC-AFTC to ensure the operation of WWTP with the desirable performance in the event of faults. Second, a knowledge compensation mechanism (KCM), which is extracted from KPPF and the fault data, is employed to reconstruct the control law for different fault conditions in active FTC (AFTC). Then, KC-AFTC can maintain the continuously safe and stable operation of WWTP. Third, the stability of knowledge compensation-based AFTC (KC-AFTC) is demonstrated through Lyapunov theory. Then, the stability analysis can provide theoretical basis for further application of KC-AFTC in practical experiments. Finally, the proposed control method is validated through both a simulation case and a real WWTP.

Observing the BKS method using constraint modeling, two fuzzy implications, respectively, produce expression to the factors of inference mechanism and rule base. However, these two factors normally reflect different connotations from the perspectives of artificial intelligence applications and logical meaning. Enlightened by such idea, in this study, we propose and investigate the differently implicational BKS (DBKS) method. Initially, main properties of DBKS are validated. The reversibility and interpolativity of DBKS are proved under certain conditions. The equivalent relationship is verified between interpolativity and continuity for DBKS. The robustness of DBKS is confirmed from both the similarity and the extensional hull. Posteriorly, the computational performance of DBKS is analyzed. In DBKS, the preservation of the indistinguishability holds for input fuzzy sets, and it is proved that the first-aggregate-then-infer (FATI) reasoning strategy of DBKS is equivalent to the first-infer-then-aggregate (FITA) one. To improve the computational efficiency, the H-DBKS method is presented. In addition, the fuzzy system is established on the strength of the DBKS method, the singleton fuzzifier and the centroid defuzzifier. Its response function is analyzed and a universal approximator is built by the fuzzy system via DBKS. At the end, we compare the results of DBKS with BKS by virtue of two examples in affective computing. It is discovered that DBKS can create superior forms of FRI in comparison to those produced by BKS.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been viewed widely in many practical applications and caused lots of research interests. A popular solution based on deep learning techniques is first building an anomaly detection model by offline learning on a specific training data and subsequently utilizing the model to detect anomalies in the online setting. On the one hand, previous works have introduced a plenty of learning methods for building anomaly detection models, but it is well known that no one can perform best in all settings. Therefore, there is usually high demand for collecting multiple detection models in practical applications. On the other hand, in view of the limited computing resources in many online anomaly detection applications, it is almost impossible to run multiple detection models simultaneously due to the high time cost. Then, a natural idea is to enhance the general anomaly detection procedure with an effective mechanism for selecting proper models to avoid the high cost caused by executing too many detection models. Previous works focusing on the recommendation either are time inefficient or usually show weak performance, suffering from the missing labels and heterogeneous data characteristics met in real applications. Therefore, it is highly needed to design effective recommendation methods for automatically choosing anomaly detection models. Motivated by the technical challenges, a novel recommendation method for anomaly detection models is proposed in this article. First, a model recommendation framework based on the concept of detectability is introduced, where the detectability of an anomaly detection model is defined using a fine-grained strategy for comparing data characteristics. Then, based on efficient techniques for computing detectability, an efficient model recommendation algorithm is designed. Finally, extensive experimental results are produced on real time series and typical anomaly detection methods, and show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Learning to optimize and automated algorithm design are attracting increasing attention, but it is still in its infancy in constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs). Current learning-assisted CMOEAs are typically crafted by human experts using manually designed techniques, which tend to be overly tuned, ad hoc, and lacking versatility. To alleviate these limitations, this work proposes transforming the online configuration of CMOEA into determinations of discrete and continuous parameters, which are then solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Specifically, the Actor–Critic framework is adapted to determine a factor that defines the environmental selection pressure. The deep Q-learning technique is adopted to determine the operators for producing offspring. Owing to the property of DRL, the configured algorithm can accommodate historical experience, current evolutionary dynamics, and future improvements to achieve self-learning. A new CMOEA is proposed using the automatically configured EA. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks and 21 real-world problems verify that our method significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods. The versatility and superiority of the automatically configured environment and operators over handcrafted methods justify the effectiveness of the automated configuration method, demonstrating a promising direction in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an approach to ensure the robust forward invariance of safe sets for sampled-data input nonlinear dynamical systems with model uncertainties. We first design a continuous-time composite controller structure for the uncertain system by integrating an uncertainty compensation term and a state feedback term. The uncertainty compensation term is generated by a nonlinear observer, while the feedback term is subject to linear constraints on a high order control barrier function (HOCBF) which effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the uncertainty observation error on the safety constraints. Then, inspired by the continuous-time controller, a sampled-data controller is proposed where the feedback control term is obtained by solving a new quadratic program (QP) problem with modified HOCBF constraints to address the challenges posed by sampled-data input. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the robust forward invariance of the safe sets for the sampled-data nonlinear dynamical system. From the simulation experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed method successfully ensures the safety of the sampled-data input dynamical systems with model uncertainties.},

Initially, the complex electric–gas coupling network is modeled in the state-space form. By virtue of neural networks (NNs), the NN-based identifier and the critic NN are designed to approximate the unknown drift dynamic and the optimal value function in an online fashion, respectively. Subsequently, the decentralized event-triggered control strategies are devised under the identifier–critic framework. Moreover, a novel decentralized event-triggered scheme with the dead-zone operation is proposed, which updates the controller and actuator signals only when the triggering condition is violated. As such, the computation complexity and the waste of communication resources can be significantly reduced. On the foundation of the Lyapunov theory, the uniform ultimate boundedness stability of the closed-loop control system and the exclusion of the Zeno behavior are proven.

To mitigate communication frequency, two novel impulsive control protocols are developed: 1) a pure impulsive scheme for theoretical analysis and 2) a limited impulsive strategy for practical implementation. Furthermore, an auxiliary function is introduced to characterize packet loss phenomena during information transmission, ensuring alignment with real-world communication constraints. By integrating impulsive control theory with reverse average dwell-time analysis, sufficient consensus criteria are rigorously derived for MAS with time delays and heterogeneous parameters.

Third, based on the local state information from adjacent nodes within each community, a time-limited controller is designed to enhance intracommunity coordination while avoiding the adverse effects of intercommunity competition on synchronization. Subsequently, with the help of the matrix decomposition technique and a Lyapunov-like method, several flexible leaderless cluster synchronization criteria are derived by establishing a nontrivial integral inequality and key properties of the intracommunity Laplacian matrix.

  abstract     = {Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid-self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a TCM based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-SSL environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

Time delays due to occasional congestions/attacks in the LFC are often much longer than those from signal transmissions during normal communication, which invalidates the previous stability assessment methods. In this article, a novel stability analysis method for this scenario via a segmented delay description and a switched system is proposed. First, a two-piecewise function is used to describe multisource-induced delays, including large delays under occasional harsh network conditions and small delays under smooth network conditions; thus, a multiarea LFC model with multisource-induced delay is established. The stability criteria, which is based on switched system theory, reveals the relationship between delay characteristics and system stability. Finally, the proposed method is used to assess the delay tolerance of the LFC in traditional/deregulated environments. The results show that even with a large delay causing instability, as long as it meets certain frequency and duration constraints, the LFC remains stable. This novel discovery reflects the essential improvements of the proposed method and is useful for designing better control strategies.},

For this purpose, a bank of PO observers is developed in each distributed generation unit to estimate all neighbor units’ dynamic states. Cyberattack reconstruction compares the remotely observed state values with the measured ones. Afterwards, the detected attack signal values are utilized to restore the integrity of the compromised signals, effectively mitigating the harmful effects of cyberattacks. The most important feature of this scheme, which distinguishes it from similar methods, is that there is no need for a secure channel or additional information transfer in this method.

Given the openness and sharing nature of communication networks, they are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks that impair system performance.

Although deep-based models have achieved impressive performance, several limitations remain: a single image contains multiple objects with varying scales, complex topological structures, and background interference. These unresolved issues render ORSI-SOD a challenging task. To address these challenges, we introduce a distinctive cross-model nested fusion network (CMNFNet), which leverages heterogeneous features to increase the performance of ORSI-SOD. Specifically, the proposed model comprises two heterogeneous encoders, a conventional CNN-based encoder that can model local features, and a specially designed graph convolutional network (GCN)-based encoder with local and global receptive fields that can model local and global features simultaneously. To effectively differentiate between multiple salient objects of different sizes or complex topological structures within an image, we project the image into two different graphs with different receptive fields and conduct message passing through two parallel graph convolutions. Finally, the heterogeneous features extracted from the two encoders are fused in the well-designed attention enhanced cross model nested fusion module (AECMNFM). This module is meticulously crafted to integrate features progressively, allowing the model to adaptively eliminate background interference while simultaneously refining the feature representations. We conducted comprehensive experimental analyzes on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our CMNFNet over 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

  abstract     = {Special tasks in complex and extreme environments require mobile robots to possess the good capabilities of navigation and securing map data. Mobile robots driven by the chaotic properties of memristive neural networks (MNN) can offer intriguing insights. However, the expandable MNN capable of providing multiple reliable options for diverse application scenarios has yet to be thoroughly explored. Hence, this article proposes a new universal method to enhance the dynamics in neural networks for generating numerous neural networks with rich dynamics, providing multiple options for the navigation and security of IoT-based robots. The enhanced dynamics in this method benefit from expanding the number of memristive EMR, the number of neurons, and their integration. Many different memristive central cyclic neural network (MCCNN) are successfully derived from the newly constructed central cyclic neural network as an example. Various dynamics of memristive central cyclic neural networks (MCCNN) are numerically investigated, including bifurcation, homogeneous and heterogeneous multistability, and large-scale amplitude control. The analog circuit and digital hardware platform are built to verify the physical existence and feasibility of MCCNN. Finally, MCCNN is applied to drive the IoT-based mobile robot. To evaluate the robot’s area coverage, obstacle avoidance performance, several experiments are carried out, which validate the robot’s superiority.},

The systems under consideration involve fully unknown time-varying control directions (CDs), unknown time-varying input delays (UTVDs) and functions, making the problem particularly challenging. To reduce the effects of UTVDs, an auxiliary system is constructed to produce a compensation signal. Building upon this, a novel adaptive proportional-integral (PI) control approach is developed through the backstepping method and a series of Nussbaum functions. It is demonstrated that the tracking error can meet predefined transient and steady-state performance criteria, ensuring asymptotic tracking and global boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. The key advantage of this solution lies in its simplicity of controller design and improved control performance, without requiring prior information about the unknown functions.

At each iteration, the agents not only communicate with their neighbors but also gather information about agents in the opposing network through a time-varying network, assigning weights accordingly. Moreover, we consider quantized communication and bandit feedback mechanisms, with agents transmitting quantized information and adopting one-point estimators. At each iteration, agents make and submit decisions and then receive the cost function values near their decision points rather than the full cost function information. To guarantee the payoff of each network, we design an algorithm named quantized distributed online bandit optimization in two-network (QDOBO-TN). We use dynamic Nash equilibrium regret to measure the positive payoff discrepancy between the decision sequence produced by Algorithm QDOBO-TN and the Nash equilibrium sequence. Furthermore, we propose a multiepoch version of Algorithm QDOBO-TN. The regret bounds for both algorithms are sublinear with respect to the iteration count T. Finally, we conduct a series of simulation experiments that further validate the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

However, accurately predicting future links remains challenging, as existing methods often overlook the independent modeling of dynamic interactions within individual nodes and the fine-grained characterization of latent interactions across node sequences. To address these challenges, we propose FineFormer (Fine-grained Interactive Transformer), a novel framework that alternates between self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enhanced with layer-wise contrastive learning. This design enables FineFormer to uncover fine-grained temporal dependencies both within single node sequences and across different node sequences. Specifically, self-attention captures temporal–spatial dynamics within the interaction sequences of individual nodes, while cross-attention focuses on the complex interactions across the sequences of pairs of nodes. Additionally, by strategically applying layer-wise contrastive learning, FineFormer refines node representations and enhances the model’s ability to distinguish between connected and unconnected node pairs during feature refinement. FineFormer is evaluated on five challenging and diverse real-world dynamic link prediction (DLP) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that FineFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in capturing complex, fine-grained interactions in continuous-time dynamic networks.},

To achieve PT formation, we introduce a prescribed performance function and a filtered variable, which are then used to develop an error transformation function for the controller design. Unlike existing PT control approaches, this method eliminates initial value limitations, ensuring that both the prescribed performance function’s initial condition and the error transformation parameter are independent of the initial tracking error and system dynamics. We further demonstrate that the developed scheme ensures the prescribed performance of the filtered error, guaranteeing that all formation errors converge to a bounded region within the PT while achieving satisfactory transient performance.

  abstract     = {LSOP is an essential research topic in the field of evolutionary computation community. Many large-scale optimization algorithms often maintain a large population for diversity enhancement. However, updating such a large population consumes a significant number of fitness evaluations (FEs), which may lead to the insufficient evolution of the population. In light of this, this article proposes a small-scale learning particle swarm optimization (SSLPSO) for solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). In the small-scale learning mechanism, only up to two representative individuals are updated in every generation to effectively save FEs and prolong the evolutionary generations, so as to refine the solution accuracy. Specifically, we first design a representative individual selection (RIS) strategy to select the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual for updating. Then, we develop a representative individual learning (RIL) strategy, which includes a convergence learning method and a diversity learning method for the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual, respectively. Meanwhile, we further propose an adaptive strategy adjustment (ASA) method based on evolutionary state assessment to determine whether the representative individuals should be updated, further achieving the adaptive adjustment of the evolutionary behavior in the population. Experimental results on the commonly used large-scale test suites, IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2013, show that the performance of SSLPSO is significantly better than, or at least comparable to other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of large-scale competitions. Finally, the application of SSLPSO to a large-scale constrained WDN optimization problem further demonstrates its real-world applicability.},

  abstract     = {Translating the complex dynamics of biological nervous systems into engineered models is crucial for understanding the essence of intelligence and creating human-like artificial intelligence. This article presents a four-dimensional memristive Morris–Lecar model, constructed by coupling a locally active memristor (LAM) with the Morris–Lecar model, which features fast-slow dynamics. Through stability analysis of equilibrium points, the potential mechanism is qualitatively investigated by which three types of equilibrium points trigger neuronal oscillatory activity. Different dimensions of bifurcation diagrams and other numerical techniques reveal that neuronal firing activity and its dynamic characteristics are regulated by three factors: 1) LAM; 2) the slow variable; and 3) ion channels. Based on bursting activity, the fast-slow variable analysis method is employed to study fold and Hopf bifurcations, and the fast-slow dynamics under synergistic control are elucidated. Notably, coexisting attractors are discovered and found to be closely related to LAM. Finally, the neuronal model is implemented on an FPGA to generate firing activities with diverse dynamic characteristics.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the leader–following cluster consensus for generic linear heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs). Unlike the existing research, a novel event-triggered (ET) control mechanism is designed and developed on the transmission side of the agents, over directed communication topologies, to reduce communication load. For this purpose, a variable threshold function as the fully distributed ET condition (ETC) is suggested, which provides a smooth transition and considers both maximum and minimum threshold levels for triggering. A relative-state feedback-based cluster consensus control protocol is designed by considering the cooperative and competitive interaction behavior of agents. Then, the convergence analysis is performed by utilizing the Lyapunov method. This work is then further extended for the ET observer-based output feedback cluster consensus problem. The proposed ETC naturally eliminates the Zeno behavior for each agent. In contrast to existing methods, a variable threshold-based ET scheme, a cooperation-competition network, and an elimination of Zeno behavior for both state-based and output-based methods have been considered for the leader–following cluster consensus. Finally, illustrative examples are used to validate the theoretical results.},

Using these variables and drawing inspiration from the dynamic average consensus-based approach, a pivotal theorem is introduced to facilitate the transformation of the DAO problem into a regulation problem, enabling the application of classical control methods to manage complex high-order dynamics. Furthermore, we present a control law based on prescribed performance functions and aggregative variables to solve the approximate aggregative optimization problem for high-order nonlinear agents with bounded disturbances.

While most existing efforts focus on ANN-SNN conversion for pure SNN inference, hybrid ANN/SNN inference present unique challenges where complexity and performance in both domains are critical. Key limitations include achieving ultra-low latency, maintaining unified training parameters for resource sharing, and developing efficient neural and encoding models for hybrid data interactions. To address these challenges, We introduce the Adaptive Clip-Floor-Shift (ACFS) activation to bridge the ANN-SNN gap with unified parameters, balancing inference accuracy and complexity across both domains. Our Hybrid NeuroEncoding Bridge (HNEB) integrating Clipped-ReLU for ANNs, proposed Selective Integrate-and-Fire (SIF) model for enhanced SNN sparsity, and a Stateless Spike Encoding (SSE) mechanism for resource-efficient activation-spike conversion. Experimental results on VGG16 and ResNet demonstrate SNNs achieving competitive accuracy (≤ 0.89% loss) versus ANNs at ultra-low latency (e.g., T ≤ 4 for CIFAR10, T ≤ 8 for CIFAR100). Experimental analysis reveals Hybrid Neural Netwroks (HNNs) provide superior energy-accuracy trade-offs, improving energy efficiency by up to 84.13% over pure SNNs while maintaining accuracy through layer-wise ANN/SNN partitioning and minimized encoding overhead.},

  abstract     = {Episode mining is an active subfield of data mining in which the aim is to retrieve important knowledge from temporal data and can be used to analyze fault reports and web navigation logs. However, existing methods generally do not consider time gap constraints, and overestimate the frequency of episodes, which may lead to mining a large number of episodes that users are not interested in. To tackle this problem, this paper investigates one-off episode rule (OER) mining with time gap constraints for process event logs and proposes a one-off episode rule mining algorithm called OER-Miner that can mine frequent one-off episodes and the implicit relationship among them. To generate fewer and prune unpromising candidate episodes, OERMiner utilizes episode join and pruning strategies, respectively. To efficiently calculate the candidate episode support, position indexes, and depth-first search and backtracking strategies are applied to calculate the number of occurrences. Experimental results verify that OER-Miner yields a better performance than seven other competitive algorithms on nine publicly available event logs. More importantly, OER-Miner can be applied to a real-industrial log to identify rework phenomena in the production process by mining strong one-off episode rules, to discover the optimal processes and deficiencies of the system, and provide recommendations for further improvement.

However, only some of them are applicable at at Register Transfer Level (RTL); furthermore, the benefits of combining information from assertions and fault analysis have not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel methodology for guiding AxC design exploration at RTL considering two approximation techniques: bit-width reduction and statement reduction. Then, it employs fault injection to mimic the approximation effect on the design under approximation. To guide the designer while assessing the approximation choices, assertions, which formally capture the behaviors implemented in the design, are dynamically generated from the RTL simulation traces. Then, the impact of fault injections on the truth values of the assertions is employed as a proxy for measuring the functional accuracy of the corresponding approximations. Based on this evaluation, a genetic algorithm is finally used to rank and cluster the approximation targets, thus providing the designer with an efficient and effective way to automatically analyze AxC variants in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and performance. The experiments carried out on state-of-the-art benchmarks show that the proposed approach represents a promising solution for the automation of AxC design exploration at RTL.},

Most existing sampling methods always prioritize feasible solutions over infeasible solutions during the whole evolutionary process. However, sampling infeasible solutions in some cases can not only provide search directions but also enhance diversity. To tackle this issue, a novel competitive multitasking sampling-based framework is proposed. Specifically, three complementary sampling subtasks are constructed: constraint-prioritized subtask, objective-constraint equivalence subtask, and objective-prioritized subtask. The main task is to find the constrained Pareto front. Different sampling subtasks exhibit different performances on various expensive problems. During each iteration, one of the sampling subtasks is selected by hierarchical deep reinforcement learning technique. This technique can effectively learn the relationship between the environmental states and the performances of different subtasks. Based on the selected subtask, the candidate points are generated via surrogate-assisted evolution. Subsequently, after these points undergo expensive evaluations, they can be regarded as knowledge and transferred to both the subtasks and the main task. Experimental results on three benchmark test suites and a real-world application have demonstrated the framework’s superiority over other state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment in resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to substantial memory and computational requirements. Benefiting from the sparse event-driven computation paradigm of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), some research has focused on designing spike-based language models. However, existing spike-based language models achieve only partial computational efficiency gains and fail to address memory constraints comprehensively. In this paper, we propose an evolved and quantized spike-driven language model (EQ-SpikeLM) to address identified challenges. This model incorporates two primary innovations. First, inspired by the artificial bee colony algorithm in evolutionary computation, we propose an architecture evolution method, namely ABC-Arc. This method optimizes network topology by systematically removing redundant neural pathways. Second, a dynamic post-training quantization (DynPTQ) strategy is developed for the evolved SpikeLM, facilitating the conversion of floating-point parameters to lower-bit precision without requiring model retraining. By combining these two methods, EQ-SpikeLM significantly reduces storage and computational demands while preserving model performance. Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark demonstrates EQ-SpikeLM’s ability to maintain performance equivalent to its uncompressed counterpart, with a substantial reduction in both model size and power consumption. These results position EQ-SpikeLM as a viable approach for deploying large language models in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.},

However, GSGP is limited by the fact that its operators produce increasingly large individuals, leading to overly complex models. The slim addresses this issue by introducing a deflate geometric semantic mutation capable of producing offspring smaller than their parents. Preliminary studies show that slim can maintain accuracy comparable to traditional GSGP while generating much smaller models. However, a thorough analysis of this mutation remains lacking. This work fills that gap by conducting a detailed study of the deflate mutation, focusing on its behavior and practical value. Our results show that, when applied at the right stage of evolution, deflate mutation mitigates overfitting and yields compact, accurate models. This is also the first study to explore the timing and interaction of inflate and deflate mutations in slim, demonstrating how deflation enhances generalization and reduces overfitting. We support our conclusions with a comprehensive experimental approach, including comparisons between exclusive use of inflate mutation and alternating it with deflation. We also evaluate numerical indicators such as improvement rate and training effectiveness. The consistency across these methods reinforces our findings and highlights the deflate mutation as a robust regularization strategy. Finally, when compared to established non-evolutionary machine learning methods, SLIM shows competitive performance. Overall, this study confirms SLIM as a promising direction for GP and lays the foundation for future research.},

Recently, some strategies have been proposed to use the information from both the historical and new environments to predict the population in the new environment. However, their performance in complex new environments is limited, as they partially utilize information from the new environment. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proven to be an efficient generative model, which can capture the relationships between high-quality solutions in the new environment and estimate the data distribution more accurately. In this paper, we propose a GAN based prediction strategy (GANPS) to generate more high-quality solutions that can adapt to the new environment. In GANPS, a PS estimation method is employed to improve the quality of samples (solutions) for GAN training at first, which helps the GAN better extract the information from historical and new environment. Then GANPS utilizes the trained generator to re-initialize the population, and a model reuse strategy is further designed to reduce training costs and the algorithm’s response time. Experimental results on a set of benchmark test suites show that GANPS could outperform other state-of-the-art reaction strategies in most cases and has better change tracking capability in dynamic environments.},

Discovering such conjectures is crucial for advancing our understanding of fundamental mathematical principles, as they reveal unexpected patterns and connections across different areas of mathematics. Due to their inherent complexity and infinite nature, these conjectures are challenging to uncover using traditional methods such as manual derivation and numerical calculations. A core task in studying such conjectures is identifying recursive relationships that describe potentially unknown patterns and structures. This task can be framed as a symbolic regression problem, as it involves searching for a suitable mathematical form to represent complex relationships. To address this symbolic regression problem, we propose a gene programming-based algorithm named infinite conjecture explorer (ICE) with a dual-chromosome encoding (DCE) and a two-sided matching operator (TMO). DCE encodes the two sides of a conjectured as separate two chromosomes, providing a clear representation of the underlying structure of an equation. Unlike other encoding methods, DCE improves the efficiency of discovering meaningful conjectures. Since the use of DCE results in two corresponding large and complex search spaces, TMO is designed to efficiently identify expressions that match on both sides of the equation across two spaces. The experimental results show that the proposed ICE is effective in generating promising conjectures with diverse forms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have achieved notable success in recommendation systems (RSs) by meeting diverse user needs. However, existing MOEAs lack effective methods to coordinate the challenges of cold start, low convergence of multiple objectives and lack of explainable recommendation reasons. Therefore, we propose an enhancing multi-objective optimization recommendation algorithm by integrating large language models (named as MORA-LLM). MORA-LLM uses the vast knowledge, reasoning ability and natural language generation (NLG) ability of large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the shortcomings of MOEA-based RSs in semantic understanding. Firstly, an LLM-enhancing prediction score (LEPS) strategy is proposed to alleviate the cold start problem. LEPS obtains the user embedding vector by vast knowledge of LLM and extracts interaction information of similar users to improve the accuracy of prediction scores. Secondly, an LLM-enhancing search (LES) strategy is proposed to improve the convergence of the multi-objective. LES strategy combines the reasoning ability of LLM with the competitive idea of competitive swarm optimization to achieve efficient search and balance multiple objectives. Finally, the prediction scores are further corrected based on the LLM output results and MORA-LLM offers recommendation reasons to help users better understand the recommendation results. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MORA-LLM significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and convergence.},

Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time-delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents' actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents' actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents' outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the non-differentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

However, PV power has strong periodicity and randomness, changes in weather factors such as illumination and temperature will significantly affect its power generation efficiency, which also brings challenges for PV power forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called SL-ANFIS-LSTM for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. SL-ANFIS-LSTM utilizes a structure learnable ANFIS (SL-ANFIS) module based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to characterize uncertain fuzzy factors such as weather and temperature, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module to extract the temporal dependency. Besides, physical information is also introduced to correct illegal errors caused by changes in sunlight intensity.

Subgraph query in fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graph (f-STKG) is a fundamental and challenging task. Although a few efforts exist dedicated to f-STKG queries based on subgraph matching, they are sensitive to missing information in the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the f-STKG query method by subgraph reasoning using embeddings. The method aims to capture the semantic similarity between the query subgraph and candidate subgraph of f-STKG to accomplish subgraph matching. We first embed f-STKGs into vector space to form f-STKG vectors. Then, we construct a global subgraph of f-STKG using Composition-based Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CompGCN), which allows global information adjacent to this subgraph to be integrated. Subsequently, the query subgraph of f-STKG is constructed using mean pooling and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as the candidate subgraph of the f-STKG is constructed using CompGCN and GRU. This facilitates the integration of structural and sequence pattern information of subgraphs. Finally, we measured the semantic similarity between this query subgraph and the candidate subgraph using the subgraph matching function. In addition, we designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN's capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

It is worth noting that the replay attack model in the paper is highly generalized. And the attack location, target, and frequency are all uncertain. Therefore, a suitable distributed memory event-based strategy (DMEBS) is designed. It can dynamically adjust the usage of historical data to optimize the release of sampled data, thereby determining when to update the control laws of each subsystem, ensuring system performance while greatly saving communication resources. In addition, the stability of the system is demonstrated by establishing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, ensuring the elimination of the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations conducted on two commonly encountered practical systems.},

Fuzzy support vector machines and their variants have demonstrated potential in handling noise and outliers but struggle to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets. To deal with this problem, in this article, we propose a novel relative density and non-membership-based intuitionistic fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning. The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel relative density and non-membership (RDNM) based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments, and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and non-linear kernels, and compare the outcomes with the existing approaches. Additionally, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models, underscoring its capability for addressing classification challenges in real-world applications with imbalanced class distributions.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative consensus reaching process (CRP) that integrates fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations (FSRs) and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships (TRs) using geometric analysis. Additionally, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree (TD), ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory (RT) with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios},

Noncooperative degree is introduced to measure noncooperative behavior of experts or subgroups. Different feedback mechanisms and noncooperative behavior management methods are applied to both the intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus reaching stages.

Based on the given $L_{\infty }$ performance and finite-frequency $H_{-}$ indexes, the observer is established to construct the residuals that are robust against disturbances and sensitive to actuator faults simultaneously. Under the assumption that disturbances are unknown but bounded, according to the set-membership techniques, all fault detection thresholds generated by fault-free residuals are propagated in a sequence of zonotopes. Moreover, compared with existing unknown input observers, the designed observer overcomes the issue of incomplete decoupling between residuals and unknown disturbances, thereby reducing the conservatism in fault detection. Further, by introducing arbitrary matrices and relaxation matrices, the originally non-convex observer design conditions are transformed into a minimization optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities. The trade-off between robustness to disturbances and sensitivity to faults can be achieved by the iterative solution algorithm, contributing to less conservatism and satisfactory fault detection performance. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection strategy is validated by simulations based on a truck-trailer dynamic model.},

A novel causal evaluation metric, named fuzzy bi-directional causality recognition or fuzzy bicausality recognition (FBR), has been proposed to measure a more comprehensive causal relationship combining with fuzzy theory. FBR constructs a causality estimation model from both sufficient and necessary perspectives, and introduces fuzzy theory to handle the uncertainty in the process of feature discretization. Building on this foundation, decision trees and RFs are established with FBR to form the FBRF while conducting complexity analysis simultaneously. In terms of experiments, results from twenty public datasets of different sizes show that FBRF simplifies the model scale while maintaining comparable precision compared to other RF variants. Therefore, it is demonstrated that FBRF reaches a trade-off between superior interpretability and high performance.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection can select important features to address dimensional curses. Subspace learning, a widely used dimensionality reduction method, can project the original data into a low-dimensional space. However, the low-dimensional representation is often transformed back into the original space, resulting in information loss. Additionally, gate function-based methods in Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy System (TSK-FS) are commonly less discrimination. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods on seventeen datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The (type-1) fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control design offers a viable solution to address nonlinear control challenges in a systematic way. Recently, interval type-2 (IT2) FMB control has drawn attention from researchers due to its superior capability of handling uncertainty which inevitably appears in real-world systems. This review paper gives an overview of the development of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 (T-S and polynomial) FMB control systems delivered in the following topics: overview, IT2 fuzzy models, IT2 fuzzy controllers, stability analysis of IT2 FMB control systems, as well as potential research topics. This review will start by giving an overview of type-1/type-2 model-free and type-1 FMB control methods and their shortcomings which can be overcome by using the IT2 FMB control design. We will identify the difficulties in analysing the stability in terms of modeling concerns, controller issues and analysis tools. In terms of fuzzy modeling, we will recall the preliminary concept and techniques for the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model. In terms of fuzzy controlling, we define the IT2 state-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. In addition, from an implementation perspective, an IT2 fuzzy controller must be well defined, i.e., uncertainty-free, which reduces it to a type-1 fuzzy controller. Then, a summary of stability analysis techniques and results will be discussed. This paper explores the role of the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept and membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis techniques in contributing to the stability analysis. We will then discuss some potential topics related to IT2 FMB control systems. This review paper summarises the recent development and findings of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 FMB control systems, contributions, perspectives, concepts and ideas from the authors. It serves the purposes to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic; to develop insight into the topic by justifying the need for IT2 FMB control and underpinning concepts; to shed light on stability analysis realized by the IPM concept and MFD analysis techniques; to promote the research by proposing variants of models and controllers, and potential research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the survival time of cancer patients is of significant clinical importance for oncologists in evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. In recent years, integrating multimodal data (such as pathological images and genomic data) has played a key role in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of personalized cancer treatment, as well as improving survival prediction performance. However, these studies still face several challenges: they often overlook the fuzzy uncertainties in cross-modal interactions and the high computational complexity of pathological images. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cancer survival prediction framework based on Multimodal Multi-instance Fuzzy Optimal Transport, called M2FOT. This framework aims to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures and effectively integrate complex interactions among different modalities. Specifically, we first employ a fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster patches extracted from all Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the same patient into different phenotypes, thereby reducing computational complexity. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Alternating Encoding (HAE) paradigm for alternating encoding of intramodal and cross-modal feature representations. Simultaneously, to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures, we design a Fuzzy Optimal Transport-based Bilateral CrossAttention (FOTBCA) module. This module introduces fuzzy membership into the global optimal matching, modeling the fuzzy interactions between histology and genomics, thereby facilitating the transmission of complementary multimodal information. Subsequently, we perform multimodal feature fusion to obtain the final survival prediction. Finally, experiments conducted on five cancer datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in cancer survival prediction.},

Hard-label voting and static fusion strategies used in prior work often overlook the intrinsic ambiguity of individual emotions and the non-linear group-level interactions, including conflict, tendency and resonance. We present Fuzzy Emotional Hierarchical Shared Space (FEHSS), a three-subspace framework that assigns each person a soft membership vector across emotion categories, simultaneously optimises conflict suppression, tendency regulation and resonance enhancement, and updates its fusion rules on the fly through a hierarchical reinforcement optimiser (HIRO). Comprehensive evaluations on GroupEmoW, GAD 2.0, and EMOTIC-7 confirm that FEHSS sets a new state of the art, reaching 91.77% accuracy on GroupEmoW and consistently outperforming previous methods on the other two benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the three subspaces and the necessity of dynamic parameter tuning. Qualitative visualisations further illustrate how FEHSS resolves contradictory cues and preserves subtle shared emotions that rigid fusion schemes overlook. Additional experiments on the EMOTIC-7 dataset with seven emotion classes show that FEHSS attains 74.3% top-1 accuracy and 71.8% macro-F1. The proposed framework thus offers both higher accuracy and stronger interpretability, providing a new pathway toward robust GER in unconstrained real-world scenarios.},

The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

  abstract     = {Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system has been successfully applied to various practical problems due to its good performance and interpretability. One important prerequisite for the interpretability of a fuzzy system is a concise rule base. However, how to construct a concise TSK fuzzy system more transparently and adaptively from data remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework of constructing concise instance-based TSK fuzzy systems using a novel multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with a bimutation strategy (MOPSO-BM). In the first phase, a basic fuzzy system is constructed, where the rule antecedents are initialized based on some representative input instances selected by a sample filtering algorithm, and the consequent parameters are obtained by least squares estimation. Then in the second phase, the proposed MOPSO-BM algorithm is utilized to further reduce the number of fuzzy rules and fine-tune the consequent parameters, resulting in a set of fuzzy systems that achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model based on their specific requirements, or simply via cross validation. Numerical experiments on twelve benchmark datasets have substantiated the superior performance of the proposed framework in designing high-precision and compact TSK fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking in bimanual humanoid robots, whose closed-chain kinematic structures inherently amplify the effects of modeling errors, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters, is a challenging task. To address this, we reformulate the dual-arm tracking task as a servo constraint-following problem and derive the system dynamics under approximate constraints using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. The humanoid system is modeled as a constrained mechanical structure subjected to fast-varying, bounded uncertainties with unknown limits. On this basis, we propose a robust control framework that guarantees both uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error, ensuring stability and performance even under severe parametric and dynamic uncertainties. To reconcile the trade-off between transient dynamics and steady-state accuracy—essential for service-oriented tasks such as door opening or coffee pouring—we integrate a Nash equilibrium-based optimization mechanism into the controller design. By formulating a two-player non-cooperative game over the controller's key tuning parameters, we analytically derive the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solutions of the game, achieving an optimal balance between competing objectives. Comprehensive simulations on a reduced-order bimanual humanoid model validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection, and energy efficiency compared to benchmark methods. The proposed strategy offers a theoretically grounded and practically implementable solution for robust, constraint-compliant humanoid manipulation.},

Then, through constructing a time-dependent switched Lyapunov functional, the stochastically exponential stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and ISDF control gains are obtained by solving these LMIs.

Specifically, a vision system based on ORB-SLAM3 is constructed to calculate the depth maps and perform dense 3D reconstruction through real-time video frames. An improved Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration-Color Correction (MSRCR-CC) algorithm is proposed to address color distortion in underwater image enhancement.

Furthermore, to ensure stable scanning and obtain a high-quality original video stream in disturbed underwater environments, a disturbance observer-based prescribed performance control scheme is proposed for the underwater teleoperation system. The proposed control strategy guarantees that the master- slave synchronization error is bounded within predefined boundaries, which can enhance the fast fourier transform response value of the original image, and thus improve the 3D reconstruction quality. A global prescribed performance function is applied, which removes the initial value restriction on synchronization errors.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control framework that integrates a hybrid fuzzy-transformer neural network (HFTN) with a fuzzy echo state network (FESN)-based variable impedance controller to ensure personalized support and active engagement. The HFTN integrates fuzzy logic with transformer architectures in parallel paths, establishing a novel neuro-fuzzy musculoskeletal (MSK) model that maps surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to joint torque through combined uncertainty and temporal modeling for enhanced real-time estimation. The variable impedance controller constructs the stiffness and damping matrices of the robotic system through the FESN and develops an adaptive update law for the FESN output weights, effectively addressing instability issues in variable stiffness control. Furthermore, driven by physiologically estimated joint torques from the HFTN, the adaption of the FESN reservoir states enables real-time modulation of stiffness and damping, facilitating transitions between human-dominated and robot-dominated modes. This realizes the AAN concept, ensuring personalized and responsive assistance. Various experiments on an upper limb rehabilitation robot were conducted to validate the effectiveness of both the neuro-fuzzy MSK model and the AAN controller in delivering optimal assistance while promoting active user participation.},

This study investigates how curiosity influences users’ navigation behavior, particularly how users strike a balance between exploration and discomfort. We propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making and apply the free energy principle to model the relationship between curiosity and user behavior quantitatively. Our findings indicate that users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating. Also, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes. These results illustrate the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. In addition, it offers a new perspective on how curiosity drives behavior in immersive environments, providing a foundation for designing adaptive VR environments.

This work proposes a view-reset network, which integrates two important branches: spatial view-reset module (SVRM) and temporal attention module (TAM). In the SVRM, the skeleton model from different perspectives is reset in a unified coordinate system, eliminating the influence of viewpoint changes. In the TAM, the perception of temporal features is jointly enhanced by weighting each frame’s importance in the context. Furthermore, the pretrained residual network (ResNet) is used for prediction. The sample size is increased through data augmentation to improve the robustness of the model. The SVRM, TAM, and ResNet form an end-to-end learning network. The ablation study proved that the model could record the key skeletons and frames in the sequence and then reset the human body to a new position, making it easy for learning.

  abstract     = {Due to high workload and often excessive working hours, team members in operating rooms perform surgical procedures under difficult conditions and often without sufficient breaks. Despite this, the team must deal with incomplete information and unexpected distractions. This requires a suitable level of attention and the ability to balance the demands of the task with available cognitive resources. Advances in measurement technology and data analysis in neurotechnology open up new possibilities for the assessment of attention processes. Increasingly complex and demanding surgeries, especially, could benefit from the application of neuroergonomic automated assistants to minimize distraction, stress, and fatigue, and to facilitate interactions between team members. Such assistants could improve performance via monitoring of cognitive and affective states as well as the implementation of suitable interventions strategies. Understanding the impact of distractions on performance, enhancing individuals’ resilience to distractions, and potentially employing artificial assistants to mitigate their effects are critical future goals. In order to support such future developments, a standard taxonomy of attention in the operating theater is needed, as is a broader consensus regarding the nature of distraction. Ideally, such a model would serve as a basis for comparison between studies conducted in different laboratories, and in principle could also be used to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the real scenario. Here, we propose the adoption of a model of attention previously shown to be effective for modeling levels of attention in immersion and describe its application in the surgical context.},

  abstract     = {Robotic interventions combining neurofeedback (NFB) and motor imagery (MI) are emerging strategies to promote cortical reorganization and functional training in individuals with complete spinal cord injury (SCI). This study proposes an electroencephalogram-based NFB approach for MI training, designed to teach the MI-related brain rhythmics modulation in Lokomat. For the purposes of this study, NFB is defined as a visual feedback training scheme. The proposed system introduces a formulation to minimize the default cortical effects that Lokomat produces on the individual’s activity during passive walking. Two individuals with complete SCI tested the proposed NFB system, in order to relearn the modulation of Mu ($\mu$ : 8–12 Hz) and Beta ($\beta$ : 13–30 Hz) rhythms over Cz, while receiving gait training with full weight support across 12 sessions. Each session consisted of the following three stages: 1) 2 min walking without MI (baseline); 2) 5 min walking with MI and True NFB; and 3) 5 min walking with MI and Sham NFB. The latter two stages were randomized session-by-session. The findings suggest that the proposed NFB approach may promote cortical reorganization and support the restoration of sensorimotor functions. Significant differences were observed between cortical patterns during True NFB and Sham NFB, particularly in the last intervention sessions. These results confirm the positive impact of the NFB system on gait motor training by enabling individuals with complete SCI to learn how to modulate their motor rhythms in specific cortical areas.},

To develop adaptive robots, we first aim to analyze human responses to different errors through a study in which users are asked to correct any errors that the robot makes in various tasks. With this characterization of corrections, we can treat physical human–robot interactions as informative instead of ignoring physical interactions or leaving robots to return to the originally planned behaviors when interactions end. We incorporate physical corrections into existing learning from demonstration (LfD) frameworks, which allow robots to learn new skills by observing human demonstrations. We demonstrate that learning from physical interactions can improve task-specific performance metrics. The results reveal that including information about the behavior being corrected in the update improves task performance significantly compared to adding corrected trajectories alone. In a user study with an optimal control-based LfD framework, we also find that users are able to provide less feedback to the robot after each interaction update to the robot’s behavior. Utilizing corrections could enable advanced LfD techniques to be integrated into commercial applications for collaborative robots by enabling end-users to customize the robot’s behavior through intuitive interactions rather than by modifying the behavior in software.},

  abstract     = {Performing retinal vein cannulation (RVC) as a potential treatment for retinal vein occlusion without the assistance of a surgical robotic system is very challenging to do safely. The main limitation is the physiological hand tremor of surgeons. Robot-assisted eye surgery technology may resolve the problems of hand tremors and fatigue and improve the safety and precision of RVC. The steady-hand eye robot (SHER) is an admittance-based robotic system that can filter out hand tremors and enables ophthalmologists to manipulate a surgical instrument inside the eye cooperatively. However, the admittance-based cooperative control mode does not safely minimize the contact force between the surgical instrument and the sclera to prevent tissue damage. In addition, features such as haptic feedback or hand motion scaling, which can improve the safety and precision of surgery, require a teleoperation control framework. This work presents, for the first time in the field of robot-assisted retinal microsurgery research, a registration-free bimanual adaptive teleoperation (BMAT) control framework using SHER 2.0 and SHER 2.1 robotic systems. Both SHERs are integrated with an adaptive force control algorithm that dynamically and automatically minimizes the tool–sclera interaction forces, enforcing them within a safe limit. The scleral forces are measured using two fiber Bragg grating-based force-sensing tools. The performance of the proposed BMAT control framework is evaluated by comparison with a bimanual adaptive cooperative framework in a vessel-following experiment conducted under a surgical microscope. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BMAT control framework in performing a safe bimanual telemanipulation of the eye without overstretching it, even in the absence of registration between the two robots.},

  abstract     = {ML-KEM and ML-DSA are NIST-standardized lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. In both algorithms, KECCAK is the designated hash algorithm extensively used for deriving sensitive information, making it a valuable target for attackers. In the field of fault injection attacks, few works targeted KECCAK, and they have not fully explored its impact on the security of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Consequently, many attacks remain undiscovered. In this article, we first identify various fault vulnerabilities of KECCAK that determine the (partial) output by manipulating the control flow under a practical loop-abort model. Then, we systematically analyze the impact of a faulty KECCAK output and propose six attacks against ML-KEM and five attacks against ML-DSA, including key recovery, signature forgery, and verification bypass. These attacks cover the key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification phases, making our scheme the first to apply to all phases of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. The proposed attacks are validated on the C implementations of the PQClean library’s ML-KEM and ML-DSA running on embedded devices. Experiments show that the required loop-abort faults can be realized on ARM Cortex-M0+, M3, M4, and M33 microprocessors with low-cost electromagnetic fault injection settings, achieving a success rate of 89.5%. Once the fault injection is successful, all proposed attacks can succeed with a probability of 100%.},

  abstract     = {Detecting anomalous BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) messages is critical for securing inter-domain routing systems over autonomous system (AS)-level networks. The dynamic nature of routing policies, massive scale of global routes, and incomplete global topology visibility make BGP anomalies exceptionally challenging to identify—let alone trace back to malicious or misconfigured ASes. To effectively overcome these barriers, this paper proposes GraphBGP, a novel BGP anomaly detection method that dynamically constructs real-time AS-level topologies, achieves precise anomaly detection and classification, and accurately traces malicious or misconfigured ASes. Specifically, to address the evolving nature of BGP routing status, GraphBGP constructs an attributed AS-level graph that dynamically integrates node and edge attributes. It intelligently tracks BGP updates to refresh this graph efficiently. Leveraging this enriched, up-to-date representation, GraphBGP employs tailored detection and tracing models grounded in graph convolutional networks (GCNs), enabling precise anomaly identification and source tracing. Comprehensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GraphBGP achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection accuracy while significantly reducing inference time, even under partial BGP network visibility. Furthermore, GraphBGP precisely traces malicious or misconfigured ASes within a short time period of 7 milliseconds after anomaly detection, enabling rapid mitigation.},

Creating the transitional domain is an effective approach, but existing models often have difficulty synthesizing transitional domains with sufficiently public features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach named feature fusion transitional domain (F2TD-Reid), which comprises two essential components: the dictionary fusion module (DFM) and the transitional domain attention module (TDAM). Among them, the DFM utilizes a feature fusion to extract and reconstruct pedestrian images from instances, focusing on capturing the essential visual elements within the images. For the TDAM, it further refines the feature extraction of instance points through an innovative weighted attention mechanism. These two modules optimize the generation process of scaling factors, thereby facilitating the transfer of knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. Through a series of comparative experiments, we verify the superiority of the F2TD-Reid method in solving UDA Reid. The code is available at https://github.com/1x-x/F2TD-Reid.},

However, recent research has revealed that the performance of GCNs dramatically decreases when confronted with adversarial attacks. This severely hinders their application in security-critical domains. Therefore, the development of GCNs that are resilient to adversarial attacks has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite this, most current defense models with complex network architectures and optimization objectives are typically designed based on specific feature assumptions or attack manifestations, and do not enhance the inherent robustness of GCNs. They also overlook the changes induced by perturbations of varying intensities and the difference in attack phenomenon across different datasets. In response to this, we have delved into the impact of adversarial attacks on the spectrum, and propose an effective adaptive robust spectrum filter GCN (ASF-GCN). This approach enhances the robustness of GCN models through adaptive filtering without introducing additional conditional assumptions. We theoretically analyze that graphs have different robust frequency intervals under different conditions, validating the necessity of adaptive filtering. Additionally, we elucidate the role of degree distribution and maximum eigenvalue in adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs reveal that our model surpasses other defense models in overall performance.},

BGFAD employs a dual threshold mechanism combining global distance statistics and local curvature analysis to detect both substantial and imperceptible adversarial perturbations. DPCR leverages attention enhanced feature encoding to reconstruct missing geometric structures while preserving semantic integrity through bidirectional Chamfer loss optimization. Our framework uniquely bridges traditional geometric priors with deep learning mechanisms, achieving attack-agnostic defense without classifier retraining.

  abstract     = {With the popularity of cross-chain transactions in heterogeneous blockchain systems, scalability has become a critical challenge. To overcome this, researchers propose to establish virtual channels, which move cross-chain transactions off the blockchain, enabling instant transaction confirmation between users and improving the system throughput. However, existing off-chain cross-chain transaction schemes encounter the following issues: (i) they are incompatible with non-Turing complete blockchain systems; (ii) they are incapable of accessing authentic information from blockchain systems. These issues have a dual impact on the cross-chain transaction, affecting its compatibility and dispute resolutions among mutually distrustful users. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces SightCVC, a novel cross-chain payment protocol. The core of SightCVC is a new smart contract, which facilitates unrestricted off-chain transactions among mutually distrustful users in heterogeneous blockchain systems. It only requires off-chain protocol of the blockchain system involved in the transactions to support a Turing complete scripting language, which resolves the compatibility issue. Meanwhile, it can securely retrieve the real information from the blockchain systems, significantly improving the effectiveness of dispute resolution and enforcing the privacy of cross-chain transactions. We conduct a thorough security analysis within the Universal Composability framework to validate that SightCVC can achieve consensus at each stage. We implement and deploy SightCVC on the experimental networks of Ripple and Ethereum. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SightCVC is able to effectively handle the disputes and reduce the system costs by approximately 64% compared to existing solutions. Its superiority becomes more evidence when the number of transactions increases.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), clients share gradients with a central server while keeping their data local. However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients’ data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such Active Gradient Leakage Attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).},

OTAuth provides a more secure and convenient alternative to password-based and Short Message Service (SMS)-based authentication schemes. Consequently, the OTAuth service has been adopted by numerous Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) worldwide. However, a high severity vulnerability remains unaddressed in the OTAuth service, which allows an attacker to access a victim’s various app accounts, posing a significant risk to user privacy and data security. In this paper, we present LoadShow, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first security-enhanced OTAuth scheme to address this vulnerability. We propose a novel dynamic application identification technique that aims to address the root cause of this vulnerability, i.e., the inability of MNOs to distinguish between different applications on the same device. Specifically, application identification is based on the hardware load side-channel and captures the unique CPU and GPU load characteristics of applications through the sequence of timing values of fingerprinting functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of LoadShow by accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR). We also evaluate its multi-platform compatibility on devices with different architectures and models. LoadShow achieves over 90% accuracy, with a TPR exceeding 90% and an FPR below 1%. The evaluation results demonstrate LoadShow’s capability to effectively differentiate between applications on a device, defend against app impersonation attacks, and reliably identify legitimate applications.},

  abstract     = {Model Extraction (ME) replicates the performance of another entity’s pretrained model without authorization. While extensively studied in image classification, object detection and other tasks, ME for image restoration has been scarcely studied despite its broad applications. This paper presents a novel ME framework for image denoising networks, a fundamental one in image restoration. The framework tackles unique challenges like the black-box nature of the victim model, limiting access to its parameters, gradients, and outputs, and the difficulty of acquiring data that matches the original noise distribution while having adequate diversity. Our solution involves simulating the victim’s noise conditions to transform clean images into noisy ones and introducing loss functions to optimize the generator and substitute model. Experiments show that our method closely approximates the victim model’s performance and improves generalization in some scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address ME in the field of image restoration, paving the way for future research in this area.},

  abstract     = {Operational technology (OT) systems face increasing cybersecurity risks from adversarial behavior. This paper describes the development of a Bayesian network risk model to enhance the comprehension of observable cyber-events caused by malicious activity in OT environments. The core of the Bayesian network is a process model that characterizes the stages of adversary behavior. The remainder of the model leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) taxonomy, which includes tactics and techniques that may be used by the adversary. The observables provide evidence for adversary behavior through the intermediary technique and tactic nodes. One challenge in constructing this model is a lack of open-source data from cyber-attacks on OT systems. This paper demonstrates the use of both historical data and expert knowledge to construct the Bayesian network. The historical data was obtained from open-source reporting of 27 cyber-attacks affecting OT systems. The expert knowledge was obtained from a panel of subject matter experts with experience in a variety of OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. Finally, the Bayesian network is demonstrated using two historical case studies: the Darkside ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the destructive cyber-attack targeting the Thyssenkrupp blast furnace. By using this approach, OT cybersecurity professionals can better identify and characterize adversarial behavior in their systems to enable risk-informed investigations and interruptions before impact occurs.},

Specifically, we utilize CLIP, a deep neural network model, to extract features of images and texts. We design two ANN search methods for high-dimensional feature vectors by utilizing the space partitioning technique and Singular Value Decomposition algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, we employ adapted Random Matrix Multiplication (RMM) for efficient and secure vector similarity computations. Our rigorous security analysis demonstrates that our proposed schemes are secure. We conduct experiments on four datasets and systematically compare the performance of different encrypted retrieval methods.

Threshold searchable encryption provides a collaborative search service for group users; a single user cannot search for ciphertext. However, the threshold searchable encryption based on the Shamir secret sharing mechanism cannot achieve flexible user dynamic since the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for recovering the secret value changes with the group user add or delete, resulting in the ciphertext or trapdoor containing Lagrange interpolation formula needs to be recreated. In this paper, the conjunctive keyword search with dynamic group-user scheme (CKSDGU) is proposed to realize group-user flexible addition and deletion. The proposed CKSDGU scheme can match successfully without the data owner resetting ciphertext and the original data user generating trapdoors. In addition, multi-keyword conjunctive retrieval is implemented in the CKSDGU scheme, and group users can search the target ciphertexts that contain all users’ query keyword sets. The security analysis illustrates that the CKSDGU scheme can resist chosen keyword attacks and keyword guessing attacks.

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks are pernicious when attackers inject a trigger into the input data without altering its ground-truth label, known as clean-label backdoor attacks. The effectiveness and stealth of existing clean-label backdoor attacks rely on access to global training data, making them resource-intensive and impractical. This paper introduces a novel clean-label backdoor attack that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining exceptional stealth under realistic constraints. Unlike prior approaches focused on spatial differences between clean and poisoned data, a key novelty of the new attack is the suppression of high-frequency components in the frequency domain, which minimizes human-detectable contrasts and enhances trigger imperceptibility. Moreover, we employ an affine combination of static and adaptive triggers, effectively balancing their strengths to maximize ASR. Surrogate models are designed to simulate victim model behavior and auxiliary models are applied to extract the spatial and frequency features of the static triggers, enabling trigger design with minimal knowledge of the victim model. Our attack achieves a higher ASR than state-of-the-art backdoor attacks while maintaining higher benign accuracy across various models and datasets. It also demonstrates strong resistance against the latest defense mechanisms, including STRIP, SentiNet, neural cleanse, fine-pruning, and ANP.},

To address these challenges in real-world environments, we propose a novel system, ORI, designed to tackle two critical tasks: 1) open recognition, including classifying known class samples while recognizing unknown ones, and 2) inspection, involving further inspecting samples recognized as unknown. Specifically, we reformulate open recognition as a binary classification task and propose a density-based method to recognize low-density samples as unknown while classifying known class samples with a closed-world classifier, thereby minimizing the risk associated with open spaces. To reduce the inspection overhead of samples recognized as unknown, we treat unknown sample inspection as a constrained clustering task, using a few manually inspected samples as constraints, and then assign labels to the remaining unknown samples via clustering. We evaluate our system against established open recognition and unknown sample inspection baselines through extensive experiments on three public datasets. Additionally, we simulated a security analyst inspecting unknown samples labeled by ORI. The experimental results demonstrate that ORI accurately classifies known class samples, recognizes unknown samples, and effectively labels samples recognized as unknown, enhancing both open recognition and inspection capabilities.},

Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model’s parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.},

The classification of tactics and techniques descriptions in CTI has been extensively studied to assist security experts in interpreting attack patterns. Although many recent studies have applied various deep learning methods to enhance classification performance, they mainly focus on improving performance from an average or top perspective. However, the imbalance between tactical and technical tag samples, as well as text sparsity, may lead to poor model performance, which has been under-explored. To address these issues, we propose a new tactics and techniques classification model based on adversarial contrastive learning and meta-path (TTC-ACLM). In TTC-ACLM, a novel text representation learning module is first designed. It includes pre-trained language model (PLM) and contrastive adversarial methods, which can better adapt to categories with smaller sample sizes while obtaining better text representations. Then, heterogeneous information networks are used to model the rich relationships between texts and labels (tactics and techniques), which can merge additional information, e.g., processes and tools, to address text sparsity. Next, we defined a meta-path based classifier learning module that maps text, tactics, and meta-path based context to a set of classifiers, which are applied to the text representation generated by the text representation module for better classification. Finally, the classification performance is further improved through the tactics and techniques correlation enhancement matrix. Through in-depth research, we demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively address the impact of sample imbalance and text sparsity. Extensive experimental results indicate that TTC-ACLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

To address the trade-off between privacy preservation and efficiency, this paper introduces FedPN, a novel privacy-preserving approach that leverages periodic neuron technique, ensuring both enhanced privacy and efficient model training. Specifically, we propose a lightweight obfuscation mechanism integrated into the model’s input layer, where a specialized obfuscation layer is designed to ensure privacy, exploiting the synergistic interaction between convolutional operations and nonlinear activation functions to enhance feature extraction. We further integrate this privacy protection mechanism into FL model training, where the obfuscation layer is shared globally among all clients, aiming to achieve an optimal trade-off between the learnability and confidentiality of obfuscated features. In contrast to Homomorphic Encryption, our approach eliminates the need for heavy homomorphic operations, maintaining a practical level of training efficiency. Our theoretical analysis proves an exponentially negligible privacy guarantee against successful feature reconstruction attacks, with the success probability bounded by o(γ−m), where the frequency parameter γ > 1 and dimension of obfuscated vector m > 0. In addition, extensive experiments show that FedPN significantly enhances defence against feature reconstruction, while maintaining comparable efficiency and accuracy to existing approaches such as Differential Privacy.},

Regrettably, practical applications often involve inaccurate information, individual non-response and dropout, and sampling biases. These factors contribute to the pervasiveness of dynamic noisy graphs that encompass structural noises, making anomaly detection more challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hypergraph-driven Anomaly Detection Framework (HADF), which resists the interference of structural noises and adapts to dynamic noisy graphs. HADF consists of a hyper encoder and an embedding enhancer. The hyper encoder leverages inter-edge correlations to generate hyperedges and design their resistant weights, further employing hypergraph convolutional layers to extract the basic hyper-embeddings of edges. The embedding enhancer exploits temporal structural correlation and reconstructs multi-head attention to achieve noise-resistant enhancement of basic hyper-embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed HADF can realize resistance to structural noises and outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying anomalous edges in dynamic noisy graphs.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ARCGEN. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

Low privacy budgets indicate the stringent privacy requirements of clients, requiring high compensations to incentivize their participation. Focusing solely on privacy budgets, however, can introduce selection bias, potentially compromising model generalization. Therefore, it is essential to emphasizes the fairness of client participation, ensuring that clients with lower privacy budgets also have opportunities to contribute to the training process. To tackle the above challenges, this paper formulates a novel DP-based incentive problem in FL, aiming to optimize the utilities of both the server and the clients. Specifically, we propose an auction mechanism that jointly selects participants based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and determines appropriate payments. The proposed auction mechanism is proven to achieve several desirable properties, including computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget balance, truthfulness, and guaranteed optimization performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices generates substantial data that supports deep learning, significantly advancing intelligent specific emitter identification (SEI) technology. However, challenges such as labeling costs and privacy concerns limit the availability of labeled samples, thereby constraining deep model training. To address this problem, this paper focuses on enhancing the data manifold structure through deep feature information, proposing a semi-supervised SEI method named SSME. A well-structured manifold makes the model capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data more effectively, leading to more accurate and generalizable classification boundaries. First, to maximize the use of supervision information from limited labeled samples, we design a supervised cross-class contrastive (SCCC) loss, which increases the feature distance between anchor samples and cross-class samples based on their labels, achieving better manifold separation of different categories. Second, we propose an instance neighborhood matching regularization (INMR) loss that captures the neighborhood of weakly and strongly augmented samples of unlabeled instances within the feature space. By aligning these neighborhood representations, neighborhood-to-neighborhood consistency learning is achieved, enhancing the structural consistency and smoothness of local manifolds. Evaluated on ADS-B and XSRP datasets across diverse settings, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches. Notably, even with only five labeled samples per class, it surpasses supervised baselines by 24.82% and 12.55% on the respective datasets.},

An optimal control strategy, taking into account the system gain, is then implemented. The existence and stability of equilibria, and bi-stability between invasion threshold and persistence threshold are derived.

An increase in the birth rate makes the system more susceptible to outbreaks of negative information, while the opposite is true for the death rate. Reporting mechanism suppresses discontinuous phase transition. And the synergistic application of preventive and corrective strategies demonstrates superior cost-effectiveness in system control compared to their isolated implementation.

  abstract     = {Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) is a classic cryptographic protocol for anonymous transactions on blockchains, currently used in the popular anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. The proof size of RingCT transactions is linearly related to the ring size, which limits the use of larger ring sizes due to the significant communication overhead it incurs. However, reducing the ring size also leads to decreased anonymity. Therefore, in recent years, many studies have focused on optimizing the proof sizes for RingCT, with the latest known solutions reducing the proof size to be logarithmic with the ring size. In this paper, we propose a new compact RingCT protocol (CRCT) for smaller proof sizes. To this end, we first design three extended schemes of the Sum Argument (CRYPTO’21), which are used to generate logarithmic-sized proofs for three distinct zero-knowledge arguments, respectively. We then introduce a new zero-knowledge proof scheme called the Difference Argument. It is used to prove that one has the knowledge of two secret values, with their difference being public. Based on these schemes, we construct our CRCT protocol, whose proof size is independent of the ring size and logarithmic with the number of source accounts. We provide concrete constructions and security proofs for the proposed cryptographic schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that CRCT exhibits significant advantages in computational efficiency and proof size over existing solutions when dealing with large ring sizes and moderate numbers of source accounts.},

Our approach encompasses three key techniques: (1) capability analysis and attribute modeling of vulnerable object (2) extraction and filtering of target SSOs and (3) automatically augmenting PoCs with SSO-specific code to create exploitation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we tested our prototype on 30 public CVEs, successfully parsing vulnerable object in 22 cases (73.3%) and achieving accurate SSO matches in 18 (60.0%). PREXP outperformed state-of-the-art tools such as SCAVY and AlphaEXP in structure-matching, and enabled the generation of new Control Flow Hijacking Primitives (CFHPs) for 3 previously unexploited vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practical value in real-world exploit development.},

In this paper, we provide a robust RFF identification method that leverages channel state information (CSI) feedback to counteract the effect of the channel on the extracted RFF features. A straightforward zero-forcing (ZF) equalization fails to fully decouple RF impairments from the channel, making conventional approaches ineffective. To overcome this challenge, we utilize the potential of multi-antenna and introduce a new device-specific feature called Relative-RFF (R-RFF), which represents the relation between different RF chains in a multi-antenna transmitter. We propose an enhanced ZF post-equalization algorithm to eliminate the multipath channels and preserve the users’ R-RFF to the greatest extent. We evaluate the robustness of R-RFF under various channel conditions and noise levels and the performance of R-RFF in terms of identification accuracy under different channel scenarios. The results show that the proposed R-RFF method can achieve an identification accuracy of 91.2% for 70 devices in tapped delay line channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB.},

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an optimized k-sparse vector mean estimation scheme under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), ensuring that each user’s entire set of up to k private values from {−1, 1} satisfies ε-LDP. Specifically, our proposed scheme employs a seed mining technique in conjunction with PRNG Randomizer, which allows users to send their data only once while enabling the server to accurately estimate any value’s mean in the domain. Our scheme achieves an asymptotically optimal error of O( 1/ε√n ), equivalent to that of a 1-sparse case, while also ensuring efficient communication costs. The communication cost remains at a minimal level of O(1) (only 2 bytes per user’s report) for smaller k values and scales to O(k) for larger k, due to efficient binning strategies. Extensive experimental results confirm that our results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating that our scheme not only preserves user privacy but also ensures higher accuracy compared to other schemes.},

The key contributions of ARBiBench include: 1) systematically evaluating the robustness of seven influential BCNN methods across various architectures; 2) rigorous validation of diverse adversarial attack methods; and 3) novel empirical findings showing that BCNNs exhibit weaker robustness than full-precision networks on small datasets but surprisingly stronger robustness on large-scale datasets. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, we further demonstrate how data scale and model capacity collectively determine BCNNs’ adversarial robustness.

However, AT suffers from significant computational overhead because it repeatedly generates adversarial examples (AEs) throughout the entire training process. In this paper, we demonstrate that such repeated generation is unnecessary to achieve robustness against transfer-based attacks. Instead, pre-generating AEs all at once before training is sufficient, as proposed in our new defense paradigm called Data-Centric Robust Training (DCRT). DCRT employs clean data augmentation and adversarial data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset before training.

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal (ST) mobility patterns derived from trajectory data are crucial for applications such as location-based services and urban analytics. However, releasing these mobility features raises significant privacy concerns, as they may expose sensitive personal location information. Differential privacy (DP) is widely used to safeguard individual privacy during data releases, but existing methods for releasing ST features often suffer from utility loss because their high dimensionality requires injecting substantial noise to meet privacy guarantees. Several recent approaches attempt to address this issue by reducing noise in differentially private spatio-temporal (DPST) features, but they either discard valuable information while compressing noisy data representations or rely solely on restrictive road network topology constraints, resulting in only modest utility improvements. In this paper, we present DPDeno, a post-processing framework designed to significantly enhance the utility of DPST features. First, DPDeno generates synthetic trajectory datasets using public information (e.g., road network data) and applies existing DP methods to create paired DPST (noisy) and ST (clean) features. It then trains a spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE), which models each feature as a graph, with road segments as nodes and transitions over time as edges. By minimizing node- and edge-level reconstruction losses between the noisy and clean pairs, STGAE learns to refine DPST inputs toward the structural consistency of their clean counterparts, thereby improving their practical utility. The trained model is then used to post-process real DPST features. Importantly, DPDeno preserves the original DP guarantee, as STGAE is trained solely on synthetic data generated from public sources without accessing any private information. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that DPDeno significantly improves both the statistical accuracy and practical usability of released mobility features.},

  abstract     = {Information bottleneck (IB) is a promising defense solution against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, these methods often suffer from spurious correlations. A correlation exists between the prediction and the non-robust features, yet it does not reflect the causal relationship well. Such spurious correlations induce the neural networks to learn fragile and incomprehensible (non-robust) features. This issue limits its potential for further improving adversarial robustness. This paper addresses this issue by incorporating causal inference into the IB-based defense framework. Specifically, we propose a novel defense method that use the instrumental variables to enhance the adversarial robustness. Our proposed method divides the features into two parts for causal effect estimation: robust and non-robust features. The robust features relate to understanding semantic information, and the non-robust features link to the vulnerable style information. By employing this framework, the IB method can mitigate the influence of non-robust features and extract the robust features linking to the semantic information of objects. We conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the adversarial robustness against multiple adversarial attacks compared to previous methods. Our regularization method can improve adversarial robustness in both natural and adversarial training frameworks. Besides, CausalIB can be applied to both Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers as a plug-and-play module. Our code is available at https://github.com/HydrogenWasser/CausalIB.},

SF2Net’s core mechanism is to first extract fine-grained local features that are then converted into sequence features by a sequence feature extractor (SFE). Finally, the sequence features are used as a superior input to capture high-quality global features. By fusing multi-order texture-based local features with globally extracted sequence features, SF2Net achieves superior discrimination. To ensure high accuracy even with limited training data, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which integrate a cross-entropy loss and a triplet loss. Triplet loss effectively optimizes feature separation by explicitly considering negative samples. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available palmprint datasets demonstrate that SF2Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Remarkably, even with a small training-to-testing ratio (1:9), SF2Net achieves 100% accuracy, surpassing SOTA methods under several benchmark datasets. The code is released at https://github.com/20201422/SF2Net.},

  abstract     = {It is a challenging problem to resist unknown advanced persistent threats (APTs) on stealing data resources in an information system of critical infrastructures, because APT attackers have very specific objectives and compromise the system stealthily and slowly. We observe that it is a necessary condition for APT attackers to achieve their campaigns via controlling unknown Trojans to access and exfiltrate critical files. We present a theoretical model called Digital Scapegoat (abbreviated as DS-IDep) that constructs an Incentive Deception defense schema to hijack the attacker’s access to critical files and redirect it to avatar files without awareness. We propose a FlipIDep Game model (GF) and a Markov Game model (GM) to characterize completely the payoffs, equilibria, and best strategies from the perspective of the attacker and the defender respectively. We also design an exponential risk propagation model to evaluate the ability of DS-IDep to eliminate stealing impact when the risk is propagated between states. Theoretically, we can achieve the objective of stealing impact elimination (LK<0.001) when the ratio of incentive deception exceeds 0.7 (η>0.7) and the probability of an attack operation bypassing the defense surface is less than 0.1 (r* × μ <0.1) under Stackelberg strategies. We develop a kernel-level incentive deception defense surface according to the theoretical parameters of the DS-IDep. The experimental results show that DS-IDep can resist APT stealing attacks from unknown Trojans. We also evaluate the DS-IDep in five well-known software applications. It demonstrates that DS-IDep can address unknown attacks from compromised software with less than 10% performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Far Field EM Side-Channel Attacks (FEM-SCAs) have emerged as a realistic security threat to widely deployed RF-integrated IoT edge devices. In mixed-signal chips, side-channel leakage may unintentionally couple with transmission signals and be emitted via the on-chip antenna, potentially allowing adversaries to extract sensitive information from the victim at long distances. However, in practical scenarios, far field EM traces captured at long distances usually suffer from noise and interference, which makes the attack less efficient or sometimes even unfeasible. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Adversarial ReFeature Nueral Network (DAR-NN) to facilitate “noisy-clean” adaptation for far field EM traces captured at long distances. By integrating a DAE model with two deep-learning classifiers as regularization terms, the proposed DAR-NN model can reconstruct features of traces obtained remotely in complex environments, thereby achieving a more efficient FEM-SCA. We first test our model by using a publicly available dataset and show that it is feasible to extract the AES key from 141 traces captured at 15 m distance to the victim, which is 58.7% more efficient than existing methods with 80% less profiling data. Afterwards, we set up a more complex experimental environment with a HackRF radio serving as an interference source. We show that the proposed model can still extract the key by using around 2K traces at 15 m even in the presence of 25% active interference, while the state-of-the-art model fails under same conditions.},

In response, the research community has mobilized, with numerous efforts dedicated to strengthening defenses against these threats. The primary goal of these techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks before any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that packing has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the reliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently, they are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or recovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. To address these challenges, we propose VisUnpac, a static analysis-based data visualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery post-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed information including both malware class and family. Our method includes unpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors based on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining them by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we employ machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors through architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive evaluation of VisUnpac based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106 samples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with a precision of 99.7%. Additionally, VisUnpac reveals that most antivirus products in VirusTotal can not handle packed samples properly or provide precise malware classification information. We also achieve over 97% space savings compared to existing data visualization based methods.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-device attack by incorporating the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to develop a generalized model. Additionally, an adaptive multi-task loss is employed to balance multiple training objectives that respectively focus on model generalization and precision. We evaluate our strategy on five cross-device SCA datasets. The experimental results show that, compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves significantly enhanced performance, as measured by the number of traces required to recover the secret key. Specifically, on a more challenging dataset obtained from three SAKURA-G evaluation boards, our method successfully recovers the secret key using approximately 300 traces, whereas baseline methods fail to guarantee a successful cross-device attack even with 5,000 traces. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkably enhanced attack efficiency, reducing attack time by over an hour compared to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Strings (sequences of elements) are often disseminated to support applications, e.g., in bioinformatics, web analysis, and transportation. Unfortunately, this may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge. Concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns in a string (e.g., by deleting some elements) while minimizing the associated quality loss has been the objective of several string sanitization methods. However, real-world attackers are likely to possess background knowledge about the string, e.g., an individual’s genome sequence is almost identical to a reference genome sequence. In addition, it is good security practice to assume that the attacker will know the algorithm that has been used to sanitize the string (Kerckhoffs’ principle). Yet, all existing methods fail to protect strings against such attackers, risking privacy breaches in critical applications. In our work, we consider for the first time how to defend against strategic attackers who possess such knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework to sanitize a string by probabilistically replacing carefully selected patterns. As part of this framework, we design three mathematical programming algorithms which compute the optimal replacement probabilities under different objectives and constraints, offering different privacy gain / quality loss tradeoffs. Our algorithms protect against strategic attackers using new concepts and measures, protect sensitive patterns of any length, and can construct one or more optimally sanitized strings that can be used in applications such as frequent pattern mining. Our experiments using five real-world datasets from different domains show that all our algorithms are substantially more effective than a natural baseline (e.g., they offer up to 2 times more privacy when they are configured to incur the same quality loss, and up to 3 times lower quality loss when they are configured to offer the same privacy). They also show that two “hybrid” algorithms that we propose, based on combining elements of the above algorithms, inherit the advantages of their constituent algorithms. These results, coupled with the generality of our approach, make our algorithms practical and beneficial for deployment.},

  abstract     = {Most of the approaches proposed so far to craft targeted adversarial examples against Deep Learning classifiers are highly suboptimal and typically rely on increasing the likelihood of the target class, thus implicitly focusing on one-hot encoding settings. In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.},

However, the anonymity of Ethereum undermines market regulatory capabilities, leading to frequent malicious behaviors such as Ponzi Scheme, Money Laundering, and Phishing. Therefore, in the face of the diverse and continuously emerging malicious behaviors, implementing fine-grained detection is crucial for maintaining the prosperous development of the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we propose FiMAD, a fine-grained and class-incremental malicious account detection framework based on dynamic graph learning. Specifically, we first propose a general graph structure called Dynamic Account Relation Graph (DARG), which dynamically models Ethereum accounts from a continuous-time perspective. Then, we design a cascade graph feature extraction method to capture deep temporal evolution patterns and neighbor interaction features in DARG. Next, we construct a pre-training universal encoder to transform account features into high-dimensional embeddings, followed by fine-tuning the model classifier with a few labeled samples, enabling accurate fine-grained detection and rapid updates for incremental classes. We conduct extensive experiments using real Ethereum data. The results demonstrate that FiMAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in fine-grained detection across five typical scenarios: class-incremental, full data, new malicious accounts, imbalanced data, and binary classification. In the class-incremental scenario, FiMAD improves the Macro-F1 by up to 26.4% compared to SOTA methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of encrypted network traffic presents a pivotal challenge in detecting unknown malicious traffic. Unlike closed-set identification, which primarily classifies known traffic classes, detecting unknown malicious traffic necessitates both accurate classification of known traffic and the identification of previously unseen traffic classes. Existing methods often face difficulties in effectively constraining the distribution size of known classes in the representation space and frequently misclassifying unknown classes as known. To address these challenges, we propose Open-Detect, a robust theoretical framework for detecting unknown malicious traffic, which leverages advanced deep learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian prototypes. Open-Detect introduces two primary constraints: a generative constraint, which enhances intra-class compactness, and a discriminative constraint, which optimizes inter-class separation. These constraints collectively mitigate the risks of misclassifying known classes and failing to detect unknown classes. In Open-Detect, network flows are transformed into grayscale images, and each known traffic class is mapped to a unique Gaussian prototype in the latent space. This design ensures tight clustering of samples within the same class and clear separation of samples between different classes. The detection of unknown malicious traffic is performed based on the distance between samples and these prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets substantiate the efficacy of Open-Detect. The results reveal significant improvements in intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, enabling superior performance in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, particularly for detecting unknown malicious traffic.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the widespread adoption of smart contracts—particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications—has introduced significant security challenges, such as reentrancy attacks, phishing, and Sybil attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called TrxGNNBERT, which combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the Transformer architecture to effectively handle both graph-structured and textual data. This combination enhances the detection of suspicious transactions and accounts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. TrxGNNBERT was pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) on a dataset of 60,000 Ethereum transactions by randomly masking the attributes of nodes and edges, thereby capturing deep semantic relationships and structural information. In this work, we constructed transaction subgraphs, using a GNN module to enrich the embedding representations, which were then fed into a Transformer encoder. The experimental results demonstrate that TrxGNNBERT outperforms various baseline models—including DeepWalk, Trans2Vec, Role2Vec, GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Zipzap and BERT4ETH—in detecting suspicious transactions and accounts. Specifically, TrxGNNBERT achieved an accuracy of 0.755 and an F1 score of 0.756 on the TrxLarge dataset; an accuracy of 0.903 and an F1 score of 0.894 on the TrxSmall dataset; and an accuracy of 0.790 and an F1 score of 0.781 on the AddrDec dataset. We also explored different pre-training configurations and strategies, comparing the performance of encoder-based versus decoder-based Transformer structures. The results indicate that pre-training improves downstream task performance, with encoder-based structures outperforming decoder-based ones. Through ablation studies, we found that node-level information and subgraph structures are critical for achieving optimal performance in transaction classification tasks. When key features were removed, the model performance declined considerably, demonstrating the importance of each component of our method. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, suggesting further improvements in node attribute representation and subgraph extraction.},

  abstract     = {As Ethereum confronts increasingly sophisticated fraud threats, recent research seeks to improve fraud account detection by leveraging advanced pre-trained Transformer or self-supervised graph neural network. However, current Transformer-based methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations, and leverages language modeling to learn transaction semantics. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective, which, together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features rather than graph structure. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Additionally, we initialize the account nodes in the graph with expert-engineered features to inject empirical and statistical knowledge into the model. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 15 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets. Furthermore, we observe from three datasets that the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization ability compared to previous work.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) face significant challenges from link flooding attacks (LFAs), where malicious bots flood towards a limited number of hidden hosts, known as decoys, at a low rate. Efficient decoy identification is crucial for mitigating LFAs and is more resource-efficient than traditional bot detection methods, given the smaller number of decoys compared to bots. This paper proposes a novel decoy identification mechanism (DIM) that utilizes the SDN controller to generate forwarding rules for critical switches, enabling them to classify and report decoy addresses effectively. DIM addresses the challenges of minimizing communication overhead between the controller and data plane while maintaining high classification accuracy. It optimizes critical switch selection by partitioning the network into smaller areas, which reduces communication costs while maximizing monitoring efficiency. Within each area, DIM pre-trains random forest (RF) models for the selected switches and generates their respective binary-encoded forwarding rules. These rules empower the switches to identify decoy addresses in LFA traffic at line speed. The identified addresses are then reported back to DIM for further analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DIM scales efficiently in terms of time and space complexity. Our evaluation with the NS-3 simulator—using real CAIDA traffic and a synthesized topology of over 30,000 nodes—shows DIM achieves 98.3% decoy identification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LSTM and CNN in both accuracy and speed. Tests under routing changes and moving target defense scenarios confirm DIM’s robustness and adaptability, highlighting its practical effectiveness against LFAs.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently compressing HD/UHD content has long been challenging due to high bitrate costs. Instance-adaptive enhancement methods try to tackle this issue by compressing a video at reduced resolution and enhancing it using a neural model specifically overfitted for this video. However, existing methods focus solely on spatial super-resolution (SR) and under-utilize the videos’ temporal redundancy. Their limited management of the model’s updated parameters also causes excessive overfitting overheads. Therefore, this paper introduces IASTE, the first instance-adaptive enhancement method based on spatial-temporal enhancement (STE), and incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model overfitting. Specifically, we downscale videos spatially and temporally to reduce the data volume and achieve efficient video compression. Then, we overfit a specific STE model for each video and use it to enhance the decoded video’s spatiotemporal resolution. Leveraging the video swin transformer’s strong capability in capturing spatiotemporal correlations, we design a lightweight and efficient model to implement video STE. The model is overfitted for each video using LoRA. By freezing the pre-trained model and selectively updating a few low-rank matrices, the bitrate overhead for model storage can be mitigated. Experiments prove that compared to directly compressing high-frame-rate (HFR), high-resolution (HR) videos, our method achieves around 30% BD-Rate gains on the CTC and UVG datasets, about 15% gains on the YoutubeUGC dataset, and about 10% gains on the ultra-long videos in the Xiph dataset.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen categories. However, existing methods often struggle with the persistent semantic gap caused by limited semantic descriptors and rigid visual feature modeling. In particular, modeling pre-defined class-level attribute descriptions as ground truth hinders effective semantic-to-visual alignment to some extent. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Bilateral-guided Prototype Refinement Network(BPRN), a novel ZSL framework designed to refine dual prototypes across meta-domains of varying scales. Specifically, we first disentangle the relationships among class-level semantics and use them to generate corresponding pseudo-visual prototypes. Then, by leveraging distribution information across dual prototypes in different meta-domains, BPRN achieves bidirectional calibration between visual-to-semantic and semantic-to-visual modalities. Finally, a synthesized class-level representation derived from the refined dual prototypes is employed for inference, instead of relying on a single prototype. Extensive experiments conducted on five widely-used ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPRN consistently achieves competitive or even superior performance. Specifically, in the GZSL scenario, BPRN shows improvements of 2.1%, 7.3%, 6.1%, and 4.8% on AWA1, AWA2, SUN, and aPY, respectively, compared to existing embedding-based ZSL methods. Ablation studies and visualization analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed components.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras, with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have shown great potential under extreme scenarios such as high-speed movement and low illumination. However, previous event representation methods typically aggregate event data into a single dense tensor, often overlooking the dynamic changes of events within a given time unit. This limitation can introduce historical artifacts and semantic inconsistencies, ultimately degrading model performance. Inspired by human visual prior, we propose a motion and appearance decoupling (MAD) event representation to disentangle the mixed spatial-temporal event tensor into two independent branches. This bio-inspired design helps the network extract discriminative temporal (i.e., motion) and spatial (i.e., appearance) information, thus reducing the network’s learning burden toward complex high-level interpretation tasks. In our method, the event motion guided attention module (EMGA) is designed to achieve temporal and spatial feature interaction and fusion sequentially. Based on EMGA, three specially designed decoder heads are proposed for several representative event-based tasks (i.e., object detection, semantic segmentation, and human pose estimation). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the above three tasks, which reveals that our method is an easy-to-implement replacement for currently event-based methods.

  abstract     = {Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) shows great potential for improving generalization to unseen classes in real-world scenarios. However, most GZSL methods depend on benchmark datasets with per-class attribute annotations, which creates a large semantic gap and worsens the domain shift problem in the visual-semantic space. To address these challenges, instance-level attributes offer an intuitive solution, but they require expensive manual annotation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach called per-instance attribute synthesis (PIAS) to generate diverse semantic representations for each instance. Our method first uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to extract visual features and then generates per-instance attributes. The patch splitting, positional embedding, and multi-head self-attention mechanisms in ViT improve the discriminability of both visual and semantic representations. Next, we define the generated attributes of class-average images as class anchor points. These anchor points are calibrated in the semantic space by minimizing the cosine similarity between the anchor points and per-class attribute annotations. Finally, we improve the diversity of generated per-instance attributes by aligning the topological structure between per-class attribute annotations and synthesized per-instance attributes with that between class-average visual features and per-instance visual features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three challenging ZSL datasets: AWA2, CUB, and SUN. The results show that PIAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under both ZSL and GZSL settings. We further demonstrate the generalization ability of PIAS by applying it to attribute-based zero-shot image retrieval tasks.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal prompt learning has emerged as an effective strategy for adapting vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, conventional approaches typically operate at the input level, forcing learned prompts to propagate through a sequence of frozen Transformer layers. This indirect adaptation introduces cumulative geometric distortions, a limitation that we formalize as the indirect learning dilemma (ILD), leading to overfitting of the base class and reduced generalization to novel classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Multimodal Self-Attention Prompt (MSP) framework, which shifts adaptation into the semantic core of the model by injecting learnable prompts directly into the key and value sequences of attention blocks. This direct modulation preserves the pretrained embedding geometry while enabling more precise downstream adaptation. MSP further incorporates distance-aware optimization to maintain semantic consistency with CLIP’s original representation space, and partial prompt learning via stochastic dimension masking to improve robustness and prevent over-specialization. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP. It achieves a state-of-the-art harmonic mean accuracy of 80.67%, with 77.32% accuracy on novel classes—representing a 2.18% absolute improvement over prior methods—while requiring only 0.11M learnable parameters. Notably, MSP surpasses CLIP’s zero-shot performance on 10 out of 11 datasets, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable prompt-based adaptation.

In this paper, we introduce Uni-ISP, a novel pipeline that unifies ISP learning for diverse mobile cameras, delivering a highly accurate and adaptable processor. The core of Uni-ISP is leveraging device-aware embeddings through learning forward/inverse ISPs and its special training scheme. By doing so, Uni-ISP not only improves the performance of forward and inverse ISPs but also unlocks new applications previously inaccessible to conventional learned ISPs. To support this work, we construct a real-world 4K dataset, FiveCam, comprising more than 2,400 pairs of sRGB-RAW images synchronously captured by five smartphone cameras. Extensive experiments validate Uni-ISP’s accuracy in learning forward and inverse ISPs (with improvements of +2.4dB/1.5dB PSNR), versatility in enabling new applications, and adaptability to new camera models.},

This innovation significantly reduces computational cost and is compatible with state-of-the-art two-stage 2D pre-trained models. Specifically, we align the text features from the CLIP model with the pixel features from the 2D pre-trained models, inferring semantic probability of image pixels based on similarity and projecting it onto 3D points. Subsequently, we introduce a point cloud pairs semantic fusion method to merge the point clouds, reducing the semantic probability of erroneous 3D points. Based on probability scores, we achieve 3D semantic segmentation on open vocabularies without any supervision or training. In addition, the semantic probability of 3D points can serve as pseudo-labels for 3D distillation, and the geometric features of the 3D scene can be exploited to improve the segmentation performance.

Diffusion models demonstrate promising performance in medical image segmentation tasks due to the progressive nature of the generation process and the explicit modeling of data distributions. However, the weak guidance of conditional information and insufficient feature extraction in diffusion models lead to the loss of fine-grained features and structural consistency in the segmentation results, thereby affecting the accuracy of medical image segmentation. To address this challenge, we propose a Mamba-Enhanced Diffusion Model for 3D Medical Image Segmentation. We extract multilevel semantic features from the original images using an encoder and tightly integrate them with the denoising process of the diffusion model through a Semantic Hierarchical Embedding (SHE) mechanism, to capture the intricate relationship between the noisy label and image data. Meanwhile, we design a Global-Slice Perception Mamba (GSPM) layer, which integrates multi-dimensional perception mechanisms to endow the model with comprehensive spatial reasoning and feature extraction capabilities.

Our approach employs a 3D facial reconstruction encoder to generate encoded vectors from images and a render module to obtain 3D face models. To minimize computational load, we innovatively propose an attractiveness computation module which leverage 3D shape and texture coefficients rather than 3D mesh models to access facial attractiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results. To balance aesthetic enhancement and identity preservation, we design a controllable beautification decoder. For the first time, we introduce the concept of “attractive centers”, demonstrating that an individual’s distance to these centers is significantly negatively correlated with their beauty scores. Our beautification decoder edits 3D facial coefficients towards these centers, achieving a significant and controllable enhancement in facial attractiveness.

How to invoke the knowledge in these models to facilitate image compression lacks in-depth exploration. In this work, we aim to harness multi-modal knowledge into ultra-low bitrate compression and propose Multimodal Knowledge-aware Image Compression (MKIC). Our key insight is that under the context of ultra-low bitrate compression, where the encoded representation is too sparse to represent enough information of the input signal, knowledge from the physical world is required to be incorporated into the compression. Thus, more shared patterns can be stored in the model together with sparse unique features also embedded into the bitstream. In light of two kinds of knowledge, namely natural visual knowledge and human language knowledge, we propose a novel Alternating Rate-Distortion Optimization to enhance the accuracy and compactness of global semantic text representation extraction, extract the local feature map that captures visual details, and integrate these multimodal representations into a large generative foundation model to achieve high-quality reconstruction. The proposed method relights the path of learned image coding, leveraging decoupled knowledge from large foundation models.

To achieve remarkable retrieval performance in such scenarios, online multi-modal hashing has drawn great research attention due to its high retrieval speed and low storage cost. However, existing online multi-modal hashing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance in the scenarios where the new streaming datapoints all belong to the new classes. Therefore, to further improve the retrieval performance in these scenarios, we propose a novel Prospective Layout-Guided Multi-modal Online Hashing, termed PLG-MOH. Specifically, PLG-MOH first establishes the layout of the Hamming space by generating a series of hashing centers to split the space. Each hashing center will be gradually assigned to a new appearing class, and these assigned centers correspond one-to-one with the classes. Moreover, we propose a novel prospective layout-guided loss, which leverages all the hashing centers, including those not yet assigned to the classes, to supervise the training of hashing model. As the unassigned hashing centers will be designated to the new classes emerging in the future, it signifies that during each round of training, PLG-MOH has already considered the forthcoming data from new classes in the future rounds. Consequently, PLG-MOH can effectively adapt its hashing functions to address the new arriving samples and learn semantic similarity-preserved hash codes for them, meanwhile it can effectively retain the information learned from the old data. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PLG-MOH achieves better retrieval performance than state-of-the-art baselines on online scenarios.},

Here, we study perceptual factors that affect the sensation of stylized immersiveness, including color dynamics and spatio-temporal consistency. To do this, we introduce an immersiveness sensitivity model of luminance and color perception, and use it to measure the color dynamics and spatio-temporal consistency of stylized VR contents. We subsequently use this model to construct a perceptually-guided VR style transfer model called VR Style Transfer GAN (VRST-GAN). VRST-GAN learns to transfer a desired style into VR to enhance immersiveness by considering color dynamics while preserving spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VRST-GAN via qualitative and quantitative experiments. We also develop a VR Immersiveness Predictor (VR-IP) that is able to predict the sensation of immersiveness using the perceptual model.

  abstract     = {Multi-view Subspace Clustering (MVSC) effectively aggregating multiple data sources to promise clustering performance. Recently, various anchor-based variants have been introduced to effectively alleviate the computation complexity of MVSC. Although satisfactory advancement has been achieved, existing methods either independently learn anchor matrices and their anchor representations or learn a consensus anchor matrix and unified anchor representation, failing to capture both consistency and complementary information simultaneously. In addition, the time complexity of obtaining clustering results by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the anchor representation matrix remains high. To tackle the above problems, we propose an Adaptive Anchor-guided Representation Learning for Efficient Multi-view Subspace Clustering (A2RL-EMVSC) framework, which integrates consensus anchors learning, anchor-guided representation learning and matrix factorization to enhance clustering performance and scalability. Technically, the proposed method learns view-specific anchor representation matrices by consensus anchors guidance, which simultaneously exploit consistency and complementary information. Moreover, by applying matrix decomposition to the view-specific anchor representation matrices, clustering results can be achieved with linear time complexity. Extensive experiments on ten challenging multi-view datasets show that the proposed method can improve the effectiveness and superiority of clustering compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep Image Prior (DIP) has shown that networks with stochastic initialization and custom architectures can effectively address inverse imaging challenges. Despite its potential, DIP requires significant computational resources, whereas the lighter Implicit Neural Positional Image Prior (PIP) often yields overly smooth solutions due to exacerbated spectral bias. Research on lightweight, high-performance solutions for inverse imaging remains limited. This paper proposes a novel framework, Enhanced Positional Image Priors through High-Order Implicit Representations (HOPE), incorporating high-order interactions between layers within a conventional cascade structure. This approach reduces the spectral bias commonly seen in PIP, enhancing the model’s ability to capture both low- and high-frequency components for optimal inverse problem performance. We theoretically demonstrate that HOPE’s expanded representational space, narrower convergence range, and improved Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) diagonal properties enable more precise frequency representations than PIP. Comprehensive experiments across tasks such as signal representation (audio, image, volume) and inverse image processing (denoising, super-resolution, CT reconstruction, inpainting) confirm that HOPE establishes new benchmarks for recovery quality and training efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, as a foundational task in human-centric understanding, aims to detect interactive triplets in real-world scenarios. To better distinguish diverse HOIs within an open-world context, current HOI detectors utilize pre-trained Visual-Language Models (VLMs) to extract prior knowledge through textual prompts (i.e., descriptive texts for each HOI instance). However, relying on predetermined descriptive texts, such approaches only acquire a fixed set of textual knowledge for HOI prediction, consequently resulting in inferior performance and limited generalization. To remedy this, we propose a novel VLM-based method, which jointly performs prompting learning from both visual and textual perspectives and synergizes visual-textual prompting for HOI detection. Initially, we design a hierarchical adaptation architecture to perform progressive prompting: visual prompting is facilitated through gradual token migration from VLM’s image encoder, while textual prompting is initialized with progressively leveled interaction descriptions. In addition, to synergize the visual-textual prompting learning, a text-supervising and image-tuning loop is introduced, in which the text-supervising stage guides visual prompting learning through contrastive learning and the image-tuning stage refines textual prompting by modal matching. Finally, we employ an interaction-aware knowledge merging mechanism to effectively transfer visual-textual knowledge encapsulated within synergistic prompting for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones, under both supervised and zero-shot settings.},

  abstract     = {Developing a unified model for surface anomaly detection remains challenging due to significant variations across product categories. Recent feature editing methods, as a branch of image reconstruction, mitigate the over-generalization of auto-encoders that leads to accurate anomaly reconstruction. However, these methods are only suited for texture-category products and have significant limitations in being generalized to other categories. In this article, we propose a multi-category anomaly editing network with a dual-branch training approach: one branch processes defect-free images (normal branch), while the other handles synthetic anomaly images (anomaly branch). Specifically, the paired samples are first fed into the multi-category anomaly feature editing based auto-encoder (MCAFE-AE) to perform image reconstruction and inpainting. In the normal branch, we propose a dual-entropy constrained deep embedded clustering module (DEC-DECM) to promote a more compact and orderly distribution of normal latent features, while avoiding trivial clustering solutions. Based on the clustering results, we further design a patch-based adaptive thresholding (PAT) strategy to adaptively calculate the threshold representing the central boundary of the cluster center for each local patch, thereby enabling the model to detect anomalies. Then, in the anomaly branch, we propose a multi-category anomaly feature editing module (MCAFEM) to identify anomalies in synthetic images and apply a category-oriented feature editing strategy to transform detected anomaly features into normal ones, thereby suppressing the reconstruction of anomalies. After completing the image reconstruction and inpainting, the input images from both branches and their respective output images are concatenated and fed into the correlation exploration and voxel-level attention based prediction network (CEVA-Net) for anomaly segmentation. The network is integrated with our proposed correlation-dependency exploration and voxel-level attention refinement module (CDE-VARM) and generates precise anomaly maps under the guidance of the bidirectional-path feature fusion (BPFF) and deep supervised learning (DSL).

This study proposes an unsupervised unified degradation-robust image fusion network, termed as URFusion, in which various types of degradations can be uniformly eliminated during the fusion process, leading to high-quality fused images. URFusion is composed of three core modules: intrinsic content extraction, intrinsic content fusion, and appearance representation learning and assignment. It first extracts degradation-free intrinsic content features from images affected by various degradations. These content features then provide feature-level rather than image-level fusion constraints for optimizing the fusion network, effectively eliminating degradation residues and reliance on ground truth. Finally, URFusion learns the appearance representation of images and assign the statistical appearance representation of high-quality images to the content-fused result, producing the final high-quality fused image. Extensive experiments on multi-exposure image fusion and multi-modal image fusion tasks demonstrate the advantages of URFusion in fusion performance and suppression of multiple types of degradations.

However, in many real-world applications, the initial views may be not good enough for characterizing, leading to noisy labels that degrade classification performance. How to learn a model for simultaneous view evolving and label ambiguity is critical yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Streaming View Classification with Noisy Label (SVCNL). We calibrate noisy labels according to the emerging of new views, thereby reflecting the dynamic changes in the data more accurately. Leveraging the sequential and non-revisitable nature of views, the method tunes existing models to inherit information from previous stages by utilizing current-stage data. It reconstructs noisy labels through a label transition matrix and establishes relationships between true labels and samples using a graph embedding strategy, progressively correcting noisy labels. Together with the theoretical analyses about generalization bounds, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pretrained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization.

Specifically, we classify the pixels of visible images from the degree of scattering of light transmission, allowing us to separate fine details from overall intensity. Maintaining a balance between interference removal and detail preservation is essential for the generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we propose an adaptive denoising strategy for the fusion of detail layers. Meanwhile, we fuse the energy features from different modalities by analyzing them from multiple directions. Extensive fusion experiments on real and synthetic complex scenes datasets cover adverse weather conditions, noise, blur, overexposure, fire, as well as downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection, and depth estimation, consistently indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the recent representative methods.

Existing methods have achieved desirable performance relying on multi-temporal homogenous HSIs over the same region, which is generally difficult to obtain in real scenes. HSI-RGB multimodal CD overcomes the constraint of limited HSI availability by incorporating another temporal RGB data, and the combination of advantages within different modalities enhances the robustness of detection results. Nevertheless, due to the different imaging mechanisms between two modalities, existing HSI CD methods cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a cycle translation-based collaborative training (co-training) for HSI-RGB multimodal CD, which achieves cross-modal mutual guidance to collaboratively learn complementary difference information from diverse modalities for identifying changes. Specifically, a cross-modal guided CycleGAN-based image translation module is designed to implement bi-directional image translation, which mitigates modal difference and enables the extraction of information related to land cover changes. Then, a spatial-spectral interactive co-training CD module is proposed to achieve iterative interaction between cross-modal information, which jointly extracts the multimodal difference features to generate the final results. The proposed method outperforms several leading CD methods in extensive experiments carried out on both real and synthetic datasets.

However, most of the existing DFBN analysis methods focus on capturing the dynamic interaction at the brain region level, ignoring the spatio-temporal topological evolution across time windows. Moreover, they are difficult to suppress interfering connections in DFBNs, which leads to a diminished capacity for discerning the intrinsic structures that are intimately linked to brain disorders. To address these issues, we propose a topological evolution graph learning model to capture disease-related spatio-temporal topological features in DFBNs. Specifically, we first take the hubness of adjacent DFBN as the source domain and the target domain in turn, and then use Wasserstein distance (WD) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) to capture the brain’s evolution law at the node and edge levels, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce the principle of relevant information to guide the topology evolution graph to learn the structures that are most relevant to brain diseases yet least redundant information between adjacent DFBNs. On this basis, we develop a high-order spatio-temporal model with multi-hop graph convolution to collaboratively extract long-range spatial and temporal dependencies from the topological evolution graph. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and can effectively reveal the information evolution mechanism between brain regions across windows.},

  abstract     = {Color grading, as a crucial step in film post-production, plays an important role in emotional expression and artistic enhancement. Recently, a geometric palette-based approach to video recoloring has been introduced with impressive results. It offers an intuitive interface that allows users to alter the color of a video by manipulating a limited set of representative colors. However, this method has two primary limitations. Firstly, palette extraction is computationally expensive, often taking more than one hour to generate palettes even for medium-length videos, which significantly limits the practical application of color editing for longer videos. Secondly, the palette colors are less representative, and some primary colors may be omitted from the resulting palettes during topological simplification, making it less intuitive in color editing. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to video recoloring. The core of our method is a set of Bézier curves that connect the dominant colors throughout the input video. By slicing these Bézier curves in RGBT space, per-frame palette can be naturally derived. During recoloring, users can select several frames of interest and modify their corresponding palettes to change the color of the video. Our method is simple and intuitive, enabling compelling time-varying recoloring results. Compared to existing methods, our approach is more efficient in palette extraction and can effectively capture the dominant colors of the video. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

However, compressing the large and high-precision point cloud data efficiently while maintaining high perceptual quality for human vision remains a challenge. To solve the problem, we propose a new structure-aware generative point cloud compression framework for human vision. In the encoder, we focus on information that is more sensitive to the human vision and obtain this type of information from different scale. This allows us to capture structural importance information from global scale and local scale, which are more difficult to reconstruct. For the decoder, we introduce a progressive generative reconstruction approach that utilizes acquired information from the encoder to guide the generation of point cloud surfaces. Moreover, we propose a novel probability cloud-based discriminator. Instead of directly assessing the authenticity of the generated point clouds, our discriminator evaluates the probability distribution of the existence of points within the generated point cloud. This approach reduces the difficulty of discrimination while effectively improving the accuracy of the generator in generating probability distributions. According to the correct probability, we can obtain a high accuracy point cloud by pruning the points with low probability. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework in terms of encoding efficiency, high perceptual quality, and generation quality.},

Existing methods rely on massive annotated image-text data to achieve satisfactory performance in fully-supervised learning. This presents a substantial practical challenge, given the difficulty in obtaining annotated texts for person images. This work undertakes a pioneering initiative to explore TBPS under the semi-supervised setting, where only a limited number of person images are annotated with textual descriptions while the majority of images lack annotations. We present a two-stage basic solution based on generation-then-retrieval for semi-supervised TBPS. The generation stage enriches annotated data by applying an image captioning model to generate pseudo-texts for unannotated images. Later, the retrieval stage performs fully-supervised retrieval learning using the augmented data. Crucially, considering the noise interference of the pseudo-texts on retrieval learning, we propose a noise-robust retrieval framework that enhances the ability of the retrieval model to handle noisy data. The framework integrates two key strategies: Hybrid Patch-Channel Masking (PC-Mask) to refine the model architecture, and Noise-Guided Progressive Training (NP-Train) to enhance the training process. PC-Mask performs masking on the input data at both the patch-level and the channel-level to prevent overfitting noisy supervision. NP-Train introduces a progressive training schedule based on the noise level of pseudo-texts to facilitate noise-robust learning. Extensive experiments on multiple TBPS benchmarks show that the proposed framework achieves promising performance under the semi-supervised setting.},

  abstract     = {Infrared and visible image alignment is essential and critical to the fusion and multi-modal perception applications. It addresses discrepancies in position and scale caused by spectral properties and environmental variations, ensuring precise pixel correspondence and spatial consistency. Existing manual calibration requires regular maintenance and exhibits poor portability, challenging the adaptability of multi-modal application in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a harmonized representation based infrared and visible image alignment, achieving both high accuracy and scene adaptability. Specifically, with regard to the disparity between multi-modal images, we develop an invertible translation process to establish a harmonized representation domain that effectively encapsulates the feature intensity and distribution of both infrared and visible modalities. Building on this, we design a hierarchical framework to correct deformations inferred from the harmonized domain in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our framework leverages advanced perception capabilities alongside residual estimation to enable accurate regression of sparse offsets, while an alternate correlation search mechanism ensures precise correspondence matching. Furthermore, we propose the first ground truth available misaligned infrared and visible image benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-the-arts, advancing the subsequent applications further.},

At the core of our proposition is Radical of Extended Mean Information for Discrimination (REID), a novel spectral distance with information-theoretic roots. Respecting the physics of spectrum as continuous function of wavelengths, REID is mathematically decomposable into spectral direction and spectral magnitude distances. The resulted feature calculations are fullband (utilizing all wavelengths), yet lightweight and fully interpretable. A similarity measure based on information theory is also justified. Their efficiency is demonstrated in the context of texture classification, content-based image retrieval, and cancer detection in which they consistently outperform existing computations based on dimensionally reduced space using PCA, ICA, and NMF.

Existing research predominantly focuses on exploiting modality-specific cues for joint learning, often ignoring the differences between multiple modalities under common goal learning. Due to multimodal heterogeneity, common goal learning inadvertently introduces optimization biases and interaction noise. To address above challenges, we propose a novel approach named Gradient and Structure Consistency (GSCon). Our strategy operates at both overall and individual levels to consider balance optimization and effective interaction respectively. At the overall level, to avoid the optimization suppression of a modality on other modalities, we construct a balanced gradient direction that aligns each modality’s optimization direction, ensuring unbiased convergence. Simultaneously, at the individual level, to avoid the interaction noise caused by multimodal alignment, we align the spatial structure of samples in different modalities. The spatial structure of the samples will not differ due to modal heterogeneity, achieving effective inter-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on multimodal emotion recognition and multimodal intention understanding datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Most existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods rely on explicitly or implicitly aligning the features of source and target domains to construct a domain-invariant space, often using entropy minimization to reduce uncertainty and confusion. However, this approach faces two challenges: 1) Explicit alignment reduces discriminability, while implicit alignment risks pseudo-label noise, making it hard to balance structure preservation and alignment. 2) Sole reliance on entropy minimization can lead to trivial solutions in UDA, where all samples collapse into a single class. To address these issues, we propose Dual-Space Topological Isomorphism and Maximization of Predictive Diversity (DTI-MPD). Topological isomorphism is a continuous, bijective mapping that preserves the topological properties of two spaces, ensuring the global structure and relationships of data remain intact during alignment. Our method aligns source and target domain data in two independent spaces while balancing the effects of entropy minimization through predictive diversity maximization. The core of dual-space topological isomorphism lies in establishing a reversible correspondence between the source and target domains, avoiding information loss during alignment and preserving the global structural and topological characteristics of the data. Meanwhile, predictive diversity maximization mitigates the class collapse caused by entropy minimization, ensuring a more balanced predictive distribution across categories. This approach effectively overcomes the aforementioned issues, enabling better adaptation to new data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Scene text reading plays a crucial role in scene understanding. As its precondition task, scene text detection has garnered increasing interest from researchers. Segmentation-based text detection methods have gained prominence due to their adaptable pixel-level predictions. Many existing methods predict the shrink mask and utilize the Vatti clipping algorithm to reconstruct text contours. However, the shrink mask only focuses on the global geometry feature and shrinks the same distance everywhere, which neglects local contour information and disrupts the instance shape feature. In addition, the post-processing based on the Vatti clipping algorithm heavily relies on the predictions and is relatively complex, causing suboptimal performance in both detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above problems, we propose an efficient and effective method named Magnetic Text Detector (MTD), inspired by magnetism. It is constructed by a text representation method flexible mask (FM) and a magnetic pull module (MPM). Unlike the shrink mask and concentric mask, the former concerns the local contours and shrinks unfixed distances on different positions, which avoids the truncation issue while preserving distinctiveness from the text regions. The latter generates magnetic fields and pulls pole points of FM to the text contour by magnetism. This allows accurate reconstruction of text contours, even when predictions deviate from the actual text severely, while saving 50% of the post-processing time approximately. Several ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed FM and MPM. Extensive experiments show that our MTD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multiple datasets from different scenes. The code is available at https://github.com/fengmulin/MTD.},

This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0% and 5.2% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8% and 2.9% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices like Jetson Nano, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

Our experimental results vividly illustrate the effectiveness of leveraging spectral information in enhancing illuminant estimation. Secondly, the adoption of a hierarchical structure stems from the need for spatial invariance in the task of estimating a global illuminant.

However, most prior methods assume that a paired source domain model and target domain sharing the same label space coexist, heavily limiting their applicability. In this paper, we investigate a more general source model capable of adaptation to multiple target domains without needing shared labels. This is achieved by using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), e.g., CLIP, that can recognize images through matching with class descriptions. While the zero-shot performance of VLMs is impressive, they struggle to effectively capture the distinctive attributes of a target domain. To that end, we propose a novel method – Context-aware Language-driven TTA (COLA). The proposed method incorporates a lightweight context-aware module that consists of three key components: a task-aware adapter, a context-aware unit, and a residual connection unit for exploring task-specific knowledge, domain-specific knowledge from the VLM and prior knowledge of the VLM, respectively. It is worth noting that the context-aware module can be seamlessly integrated into a frozen VLM, ensuring both minimal effort and parameter efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a Class-Balanced Pseudo-labeling (CBPL) strategy to mitigate the adverse effects caused by class imbalance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method not only in TTA scenarios but also in class generalisation tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/NUDT-Bai-Group/COLA-TTA.},

In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration’s structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton’s root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.},

The total loss over T rounds, when compared to the loss of the best expert from a class of experts or forecasters, is called the regret. In this paper, we focus on logarithmic loss for logistic-like experts with unbounded d-dimensional weights, a scenario that has been largely unexplored. To address the irregularities introduced by the unbounded weight norm, we introduce a regularized version of the average (fixed design) minimax regret by imposing a soft constraint on the weight norm. We demonstrate that the regularized minimax regret is fully characterized by a complexity measure we term the regularized Shtarkov sum. We also show how the behavior of the standard regret can be inferred from the regularized regret. Our main results provide a precise characterization of the regularized Shtarkov sum and, consequently, the regularized regret with unbounded weights up to second-order asymptotics. Notably, unlike the d/2 log T regret growth known for bounded weights, our results imply that the regularized regret grows as (1/2+α/4)d log T when the regularization parameter is of order Θ(T−α) for α ≤ 1/2. We achieve this using tools from analytic combinatorics, including multidimensional Fourier analysis, the saddle point method, and the Mellin transform.},

Our setting can be seen as a one-shot version of the acyclic discrete memoryless network studied by Lee and Chung, and noisy network coding studied by Lim, Kim, El Gamal and Chung. We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.},

The presented method enables us to optimize lossless codes among a broader class of codes compared to the conventional FV and AIFV codes. The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing N-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when N ≥ 3 than the conventional AIFV-m and extended Huffman codes. Moreover, in the random numbers simulation, they performed higher compression efficiency than the 32-bit-precision range codes under reasonable conditions.},

The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCSA codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field GF(q) of size q ≥ N. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as GF(2) and the integer residue ring Zpℓ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over Zpℓ (such as Z264 ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring GR(pℓ, d) which is an extension ring over Zpℓ of degree d, particularly, GR(p, d) = GF(pd) is the Galois field and GR(pℓ, 1) = Zpℓ. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of n matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto’18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of 1/n. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size q ≥ N. Finally, we present the experimental analysis of our CDMM on Galois rings.},

  abstract     = {Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω(n log(1/ε)) and often slower, where n is the input source length and ε is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require ε to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical. Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O(n logc n), for any error ε. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for n-bit sources with any min-entropy k and any target error ε with seed length d = O(log(n/ε)) and output length m = (1 − η)k for an arbitrarily small constant η > 0, running in nearly-linear time. When k or ε are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most n/log(1/ε) polylog(n). Previous fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in Õ(n) time in this setting.},

  abstract     = {The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Specifically, given n agents, the BTL model endows each agent i with a latent skill score αi > 0 and posits that the probability that agent i is preferred over agent j in a comparison is αi/(αi + αj). In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with k comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general observation graphs and highlight their dependence on two fundamental structural properties: principal ratio and edge expansion. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the critical threshold for the special case of complete induced graphs, thereby demonstrating that the critical threshold scales as Θ((nk)−1/2) in a minimax sense in this case. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on conditional probabilities of error. Additionally, we derive several other auxiliary results over the course of our analysis, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, ℓ2-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model with small model mismatch, etc. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate some of our theoretical results. Moreover, we also propose an approach based on permutation testing to determine the threshold of our test in a data-driven manner in these experiments.},

The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map x⋆(y, λ), where y is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the ℓ1-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of x⋆(y, λ), we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of x⋆(y, λ) in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map x⋆(y, λ) within finite iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reduced estimation error of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional LARS. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of x⋆(y, λ) are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of (y, λ); (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of x⋆(y, λ), we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of x⋆(y, λ), we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).},

In classical QCD theory, optimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution of stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In non-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after a change varies with time and is not precisely known. The multi-stream or multi-dimensional nature of the data further complicates the issue. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each dimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a well-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust optimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical definitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point. Examples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health monitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is applied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.},

In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients’ data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients’ data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a novel variation of polar codes known as polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes has been introduced by Arıkan. These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC (1024,899) code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than 0.75 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10−5 compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.},

  abstract     = {We consider a gossip network consisting of a source generating updates and n nodes connected according to a given graph structure. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when n nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as O(n1/2 ), and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as O(log n). Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity–information freshness tradeoff.},

Let the inner code be an [n,m]q linear code derived from the defining set D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn}. On the one hand, by employing a maximum distance separable (MDS) code with dimension 2 over Fqm as the outer code, we propose two classes of linear codes with few weights. The duals of these codes are shown to be dimension-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound. On the other hand, let q = 2, by choosing an MDS code with dimension 3 over F2m as the outer code, we construct another class of linear codes. The parameters and weight distributions of these codes are completely determined. Furthermore, their dual codes are almost distance-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound.},

We study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at nodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two quantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected version age of information at network nodes. We show that as G increases, fewer nodes have unreliable packets, however, their version age increases as well, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network. We further investigate the dependence of network reliability and freshness on various network parameters, such as, inter-node update rates and the network size.

We then provide an efficient construction of the aforementioned oracle under a sparse arbitrary outliers model and offer valuable insights into the geometric properties of the loss landscape in phase retrieval with corrupted measurements.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond-Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: “What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system?” By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance—matching that of fully-connected RIS—while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is O(NI min{D,NI/2}), where NI denotes the number of RIS elements and D is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since D is much smaller than NI in practice, the complexity scales as O(NID), which is substantially lower than the O(NI2) complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures—band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS—and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures and demonstrate the significant loss and limitations incurred by conventional RIS compared to BD-RIS in multiuser MIMO settings.},

  abstract     = {Identifying multivariate dependencies in high-dimensional data is an important problem in large-scale inference. This problem has motivated recent advances in mining (partial) correlations, which focus on the challenging ultra-high dimensional setting where the sample size, n, is fixed, while the number of features, p, grows without bound. The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide “fixed-n-large-p” asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the “fixed-n-large-p” setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.},

Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically. We discuss the extension of our results to non-binary GLDPC codes and present numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning (DL) is often achieved at the expense of large model sizes and high computational complexity during both training and post-training inferences, making it difficult to train and run large models in a resource-limited environment. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces a new framework dubbed “coded deep learning” (CDL), which integrates information-theoretic coding concepts into the inner workings of DL, aiming to substantially compress model weights and activations, reduce computational complexity at both training and post-training inference stages, and enable efficient model/data parallelism. Specifically, within CDL, (i) we first propose a novel probabilistic method for quantizing both model weights and activations, and its soft differentiable variant which offers an analytic formula for gradient calculation during training; (ii) both the forward and backward passes during training are executed over quantized weights and activations, which eliminates a majority of floating-point operations and reduces the training computation complexity; (iii) during training, both weights and activations are entropy constrained so that they are compressible in an information-theoretic sense at any stage of training, which in turn reduces communication costs in cases where model/data parallelism is adopted; and (iv) the trained model in CDL is by default in a quantized format with compressible quantized weights, reducing post-training inference complexity and model storage complexity. Additionally, a variant of CDL, namely relaxed CDL (R-CDL), is presented to further improve the trade-off between validation accuracy and compression at the disadvantage of full precision operation involved in forward and backward passes during training with other advantageous features of CDL intact. Extensive empirical results show that CDL and R-CDL outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in DNN compression in the literature.},

At now, almost all algebraic constructions of such codes are carried out over the quotient ring Rm = Fq[x]/⟨xm+1⟩ or its subring Fq[x]/⟨xm−1+xm−2+· · ·+1⟩. In this paper, we consider the construction of MDS array codes derived form Rm,λ = Fq[x]/⟨xm + λ⟩, where λ ∈ F∗ q = Fq\{0}, gcd(m, q) = 1. By giving λ-GCD Constraint of polynomials and the punctured λ-twisted circulant matrices, a generic construction and its extensions of such codes are presented. Under this framework, four new explicit constructions are also provided. Specifically, some low-density MDS array codes are obtained in Explicit Constructions I and I ′ . Explicit Constructions II and III provide long MDS array codes that can be applied in the large-scale storage systems. Explicit Construction IV gives MDS array codes both with the optimal repair bandwidth and the lowest update complexity, whose sub-packetization level is smaller than that of codes in [31]. In addition, by the LU factorization, a decoding method for erasures is obtained. For long codes, the syndromes can be computed fast. When the erased number ρ ≤ 3 (the most common errors in the storage systems), its computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. By an example, the new encoder possesses fewer exclusive ORs per data bit than that of MDS array codes constructed over Rm in [29].},

In such applications, the status of a stream can alternate, possibly many times, between a regular status and an irregular status. Consequently, it is necessary to develop statistical methodologies that constantly detect multiple changepoints in an online manner. While we may employ conventional methods of sequential change detection to trigger signals after the change occurs, no online procedure is available to quantify the uncertainty of the detected changes. In this work, we fill this gap by framing online multiple changepoint detection into an online multiple testing problem and proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change between neighboring signalled points. To obtain valid p-values for online multiple testing, we propose a data-fission-based procedure that is a simple yet effective way of dealing with the post-detection uncertainty quantification. It is shown that popular online false discovery rate control methods with those p-values can achieve finite-sample false discovery rate control. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies.

Some formulas on the rank for parity-check matrices with one, two, and three row-blocks are first derived. For the general case with arbitrary numbers of row-blocks, lower and upper bounds on the rank are presented, and these bounds can be combined to give the exact rank result under certain conditions. We also investigate the effect on the rank by changing the circulant size. Furthermore, we study the relations between the rank of the masked matrix and that of the masking matrix, which can be used to predict the rank of the parity-check matrix after masking. The obtained rank analysis results are then applied to several classes of existing algebraically constructed parity-check matrices, along with their masked matrices. Finally, we demonstrate how rank analysis can be used in the code design procedure.},

Direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, independently introduced by Kløve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known class of permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance, while also allowing for algebraic and efficient encoding and decoding. In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kløve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with O(n log n) complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with O(n log2 n) complexity.},

Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items p. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ((Θ( p/log p ) tests, there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in p, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.},

Our error exponent (resp. strong converse exponent) is positive if and only if the rate is in (resp. outside) the achievable region. This leads to new one-shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels, secret key distillation, one-way quantum message compression, quantum measurement simulation, and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter.

This approach falls short in addressing the challenges of large-scale cross-domain adaptation encountered in real-world traffic networks, and often overlooks the computational constraints of roadside units. In response, we introduce a federated learning-based distributed framework for unsupervised domain adaptive vehicle re-identification, structured in three stages: local model processing, dynamic model aggregation, and aggregated model downloading. Initially, diverse local re-identification models are trained independently within edge computing units. For unlabeled target data, we employ a novel clustering technique that averages features from multiple local models to generate pseudo labels. The framework’s second stage incorporates a historical accumulation strategy to retain and utilize the knowledge from local models, ensuring effective adaptation. Additionally, we propose a weight regularization approach for dynamic model aggregation, significantly boosting the framework’s discriminative capabilities. Our methodology, tested on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, showcases marked improvements in the discriminative performance of domain adaptive vehicle re-identification models, affirming the efficacy of our approach.},

We model each intersection as an agent and apply a hierarchical recommendation approach to these agents. Additionally, the framework addresses the challenge of training an agent in the absence of sufficient data by using transfer learning techniques. Specifically, a new intersection agent can be trained from pre-trained agents via model and sample transfer mechanisms, which facilitate the reuse of traffic control knowledge from similar intersections. The efficacy and superiority of TransLane are demonstrated through simulation studies that show it outperforms models that optimize space or time resources independently using widely adopted traffic control optimization methods.},

With the characteristics of low construction cost, flexible deployment and strong environment adaptability, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is increasingly leveraged for vehicle target recognition, acts as the air part of future intelligent transport systems (ITS) for traffic management, accident handling and vehicle order management, and provides a more efficient, safe and sustainable transport mobility solutions in future ITS. Promoted by the massive number of intelligent vehicles and growing demands of connected vehicles in ITS, continuous and high-fidelity spatio-temporal monitoring of vehicle movement is expected in future ITS, raising the pursuit of higher vehicle recognition performance. As a typical distributed training framework, federated learning (FL) is a desired paradigm to improve sensing performance with the communication of sensing parameters for UAV-enabled ITS. Due to the heterogeneity of sensing data in the cooperative UAV-enabled ITS, the non-independent identically distribution (Non-IID) issue is inevitable. The existing data augmentation works aimed at Non-IID issue in FL utilize single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), where the local model parameters are input into a central network, resulting in the model privacy leakage problem. To deal with the above issue, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is applied to optimize the training accuracy and data augmentation efficiency for UAV in ITS. Moreover, a decentralized blockchain-based FL (BFL) framework is proposed to avoid the single-point failure in UAV-enabled ITS. The experiments are conducted on the generated vehicle dataset (VRID) and the simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm exhibits a superior performance than the benchmark algorithms, especially in terms of higher vehicle target recognition accuracy and lower communication overhead, which provides a significant technology support for vehicle identification and tracking in future ITS.},

Traditional rule-based autonomous driving decision-making methods set corresponding rules in relatively simple single scenarios, which are not suitable for complex and diverse multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. The Learning methods based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs), unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, can extract the complexity of spatial relationships and temporal dependencies and output driving actions for a period of time in the future. However, most ST-GNNs used for autonomous driving decision-making only consider vehicle nodes, ignoring the heterogeneous node attributes that record rich scenario semantic information, which have not been fully utilized to guide better graph structure learning. But these semantic information are equally crucial for autonomous driving decision-making. To couple with these problems, we propose an Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, namely ST-HANet, to first construct a dynamic heterogeneous graphs to represent a multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. Furthermore, for spatial dimension, via mining heterogeneous graph information through heterogeneous graph attention network, and fuse the mined relationship representations with ego vehicle node information through cross attention mechanisms. Next, for temporal dimension, capturing the temporal dependencies of the sequences through the temporal attention mechanism. Moreover, we conducted open-loop and closed-loop testing of the model based on the CARLA simulator, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has higher accuracy and better decision-making performance than existing methods.},

However, most existing methods generate multiple sets of trajectories for each independent agent to cover diverse modalities, overlooking interactions among agents during the prediction period, making it challenging to achieve scene-level consistency in multi-agent predictions. This paper introduces MliG, a scene-level multimodal conditional motion prediction framework based on Multi-Layer Interaction Graph. The interaction graph designed explicitly represent the interaction behaviors of multi-agents over future periods, guiding conditional trajectory prediction to achieve planning-friendly prediction result representation. First, an Interaction-Mask-based determination strategy is introduced to obtain ground truth interaction labels, enabling data-driven implicit relationship learning, and the generated training labels can support the accurate construction of the interaction graph. Second, scene simplification and modality decoupling using the interaction graph make it easier to fuse information and represent driving scenarios efficiently. Based on the multi-layer design, the complex interactions between agent pairs are decomposed into different group and modality layers, ensuring the diversity of interactions while improving the efficiency of conditional predictions. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2, Argoverse 1, and INTERACTION Datasets demonstrate that the proposed MliG achieves high prediction accuracy and significantly improves the scene-level consistency of trajectory prediction modalities for multi-agents in the same driving scenario.},

This work builds on previous network-flow-based charge scheduling approaches and includes both consumption and demand time-of-use costs while accounting for uncontrolled loads on the same meter. Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model compatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for increased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain environment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon planner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while reacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is analyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning methods. It is found to provide up to 52% cost savings compared to a non-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an optimal open-loop method.},

  abstract     = {Location-based services (LBS) have become an integral part of daily life and work for the general public. However, achieving widespread and accurate positioning in typical indoor environments remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-floor indoor parking lots where radio frequency signals like WiFi are often unavailable. Indoor magnetic matching presents a viable solution, but it requires reducing mapping costs through the use of crowdsourced data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative method for constructing magnetic maps using crowdsourced vehicle data. Our approach introduces a multi-user joint vehicle dead reckoning technique based on graph optimization, which provides consistent directional estimates of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Subsequently, we establish associations between different vehicle trajectories using multi-attribute features of the magnetic field. Building on this foundation, we propose a global trajectory optimization with inequality and equality constraints to achieve precise estimation of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Testing with simulated data from two three-floor underground parking lots demonstrates that the proposed method, utilizing only on-board smartphone sensor data, achieves plane and elevation errors of less than 2.75 meters (95%) and 0.59 meters (95%), respectively. Additionally, the magnetic matching positioning error based on crowdsourced magnetic sequence maps is less than 2.29 meters (95%).},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the latest generation of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) enables real-time, intelligent communication between vehicles and nearby transport infrastructures like roadside units, cloud servers, etc. It supports secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and other communication forms, which are vital in intelligent transportation systems. However, the dependence on wireless channels introduces risks, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks, that lead to potential data leakage. Furthermore, many existing schemes rely on a centralized Trusted Authority (TA) for mutual authentication, which creates scalability limitations and increases latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoV using blockchain and a multi-TA network, which enables decentralized V2V and V2I authentication. Additionally, a lightweight Few-Shot Learning (FSL)-based module is integrated at the Zone Manager (ZM) level to classify real-time traffic conditions based on limited labeled samples. This enhances traffic control without compromising security. The distributed ledger managed by multiple TAs ensures synchronized access to authenticated credentials, facilitating secure communication across different zones. The security and performance analyses demonstrate the proposed scheme’s security and efficiency over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Generalizable semantic segmentation, aims to excel on unseen target domains, as a critical focus due to the widespread practical applications requiring high generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, which depict class-wise centroids, as a type of domain-invariant information are key to improving the model generalizability due to its stability and representativeness. However, this manner faces some challenges. First, the existing methods adopt a coarse prototypical alignment form, potentially compromising performance. Second, the naive prototype generally serves as the class centroid generated by an average operation from source data batches, risks source domain overfitting, and may be detrimentally impacted by unrelated source data. Third, from a broader perspective, rather than just from a prototypical alignment perspective, the existing methods treat all samples equally, which is against the conclusion that different source features have different adaptation difficulties. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method for generalizable semantic segmentation called Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting (PPAR) depending on the strong generalized representation of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model. In particular, we first define the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP) generated by the CLIP model, laying the foundation for the subsequent effective alignment strategy. Then, we propose a prototypical progressive alignment strategy by an easy-to-difficult alignment form to reduce domain-variant information progressively instead of directly. Finally, we propose a prototypical reweighting learning strategy that estimates the importance of the source data and corrects its learning weight to alleviate the influence of unrelated source features, i.e. alleviate negative transfer. Moreover, we also offer a theoretical insight into our method and it shows that our method compiles well on the domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our PPAR method achieves superior performance, proving the effectiveness of our method.

  abstract     = {Structural disruptions in road networks, such as bridge closures or road outages, can severely impact traffic flow, leading to significant connectivity losses and unpredictable shifts in traffic patterns. Traditional traffic prediction models, designed for stable network conditions, often fail to adapt to these sudden changes in road capacity and connectivity. To address this challenge, we formalize flow redistribution caused by structural changes as a dynamic network prediction task. We then propose a novel feature-aware subgraph augmentation framework that enables Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to learn robust redistribution patterns—even with limited historical data. Our framework simulates disruptions via subgraph perturbations to generate realistic training samples, effectively enriching the dataset and enhancing model generalizability to structural changes. Evaluated on the Hammersmith Bridge closure in London, the proposed augmentation strategy significantly improves model performance and outperforms data-hungry baselines, accurately capturing the disruption and its network-wide effects. This study demonstrates that targeted data augmentation can make STGNNs more effective in disruption scenarios with scarce historical data—offering a new, data-efficient paradigm for daily traffic prediction under both planned and unplanned network changes.},

  abstract     = {The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally, queueing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time-varying demand and fixed capacity. However, field observations indicate that flow rates drop during freeway congestion at merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic—a factor often overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point is analytically derived in a closed-form, accounting for the reduction caused by the dynamic multi-stage merging process. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue length and traffic delay are derived as the first optimization objective. Additionally, a crash risk function is formulated to quantitatively assess potential collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective. Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to find the minimum-cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more efficient and safer merging process.},

  abstract     = {In automatic parking scenarios, obstacles on both sides of a target parking space (TPS) will degrade the feasibility and comfort of passengers boarding and alighting (CPBA) when the target vehicle maintains a standard final parking state (FPS). Additionally, the presence of dynamic obstacle vehicles (DOV) in the parking lot severely challenges the adaptability of path - planning algorithms. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a method for FPS optimization and two-stage path planning in dynamic scenarios while considering CPBA. First, a CPBA characterization variable is established using the allowed opening angle of the vehicle door (OAVD) restricted by adjacent obstacles. Then, to enhance path quality, the basic motion curve (BMC) of the vehicle is formulated for the design of queuing, parking, and transition paths. A two-stage path planning framework that integrates the parking lot system and the automatic parking system (APS) of the target vehicle is proposed. It includes a Dijkstra algorithm with embedded occupancy dynamic time windows of corridor nodes (DDTW) for queuing path planning and a parking path planning method based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, aiming to improve CPBA and parking efficiency. Simulation experiments using real-world parking lot and vehicle parameters show that the proposed method can effectively reduce queuing time and enhance comfort, validating its effectiveness. A comparison with other parking path planning methods further demonstrates the superiority of the path performance achieved by the proposed approach.},

This study addresses the PTPSPD under realistic constraints and proposes an effective iterated local search algorithm that integrates complementary components to balance exploration and exploitation. A cluster-first, route-second heuristic is employed to generate high-quality initial solutions. The search process is intensified via a randomized variable neighborhood descent strategy. To enhance global exploration, a combination of random perturbation mechanisms and adaptive threshold acceptance criteria is employed. A dynamic tabu list further promotes diversification and prevents premature convergence. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark set of 117 PTPSPD instances involving 50 to 199 customers. Results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, establishing new best-known lower bounds for 64 instances. Additionally, the algorithm is tested on classical VRPSPD instances from the literature, further confirming its ability to consistently provide high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time.},

However, lane detection still faces several critical challenges in real-world scenarios: 1) severe occlusions caused by urban traffic and complex road layouts; 2) the difficulty of handling sharp curves and large curvature variations; and 3) varying lighting conditions that blur or degrade lane markings. To address these challenges, we propose DLNet, a novel direction-aware feature integration framework that integrates both low-level geometric details and high-level semantic cues. In particular, the approach includes: (i) a Multi-Skip Feature Attention Block (MSFAB) to refine local lane features by adaptively fusing multi-scale representations, (ii) a Context-Aware Feature Pyramid Network (CAFPN) to enhance global context modeling under adverse conditions, and (iii) a Directional Lane IoU (DLIoU) loss function that explicitly encodes lane directionality and curvature, providing more accurate lane overlap estimation.

This paper proposes a phase portrait-based sliding mode control method via differential braking at the towing car and the trailer simultaneously to realize the direct yaw moment control and improve dynamic stability. In this process, a nonlinear single-track model with 3 degrees of freedom is established and integrated into the controller design. The stability region of the towing car and the trailer is analyzed based on the sideslip angle – yaw rate phase portraits under different speeds. And the sliding mode surface of controller is designed based on the stability region. The Matlab/Simulink and TruckSim co-simulation is established to verify the performance of controller. The steering wheel input of simulation is designed in accordance with ISO9815 and the dynamic critical speed is determined based on the yaw damping ratio of car-trailer combination. Compared with the model predictive control-based method, the simulation results demonstrate that the phase portrait-based sliding mode control method has realized yaw damping ratio of 0.81 both in the towing car and the trailer at dynamic critical speed.

  abstract     = {In recent years, relying on large amounts of labeled data in specific scenarios, instance segmentation has made great strides in autonomous driving. However, labeling sufficient images for each target domain scene is time-consuming and impractical. Based on this, for effectively utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the model performance, this paper proposes a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-driven Pseudo-Labels gEneration (SAMPLE) framework for enhancing semi-supervised instance segmentation (SSIS) in autonomous driving environments. This framework is the first to apply the visual foundation model SAM to an SSIS framework, using precise prompts and the segmentation capabilities of SAM to generate pseudo-labels. Additionally, to mitigate pseudo-label noise, a Multi-Point Enhancement (MPE) prompting method is proposed, which enables SAM to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and thus improve the performance of the segmentation model. Experiments were conducted on the public datasets Cityscapes and COCO. The results show that using only 5% of the labeled data from Cityscapes, the proposed method achieves a 1.8% improvement over the current state-of-the-art GD method. On COCO, SAMPLE consistently surpasses other methods across various data percentages. Furthermore, compared to the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) method, our method boasts higher accuracy, reduces model size by 8@, decreases GPU memory usage to 1/3 of the original, and increases inference speed by 110@. These improvements lay the foundation for effectively deploying segmentation models in the autonomous driving environment.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of the Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has enabled unprecedented opportunities for exploring individual mobility patterns (IMPs) within transport hubs. IMP prediction studies in indoor environments face three critical limitations: suffering from incompatible data cleaning, ignoring the characteristic of trajectories having fewer “stay” phases, and lacking adequate individual historical trajectories. This study proposes an IMPs prediction framework by designing a novel floor filter algorithm (FFA), a hybrid Douglas-Peucker and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DP-DBSCAN), and a various-order Markov chain tree (VOMC-Tree) model. Within this framework, the FFA is utilized to eliminate the effects of “floor hopping”. Additionally, the DP-DBSCAN algorithm is designed to identify Key Points (KPs) within trajectories, conquering the limitation of fewer “stay” phases. To overcome the lack of individual historical trajectories, the VOMC-Tree model is proposed for online predictions of passengers’ IMPs based on offline training. To evaluate the performance of the prediction framework, a case study is conducted using a Bluetooth-based indoor trajectory dataset collected from Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) of China and an expanded dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline models across various scales of training datasets, as further evidenced by an analytical unpredictability ratio. The VOMC-Tree model performs well in predicting the sharing rate of transportation modes. The predictions of IMPs can be applied to intelligent systems for the management of transport hubs and the optimization of passenger flow. The predictions regarding the sharing rate are beneficial to the planning and scheduling of multi-traffic modes system.},

Challenges arise in designing UAV-borne RIS (U-RIS) assisted communications, such as the influence of non-LoS, dynamic RIS configuration, and energy consumption of the UAV. To tackle these challenges, we put forth a new U-RIS assisted uplink transmission framework, in which the direct links from the ground users to the corresponding ground base station are blocked. We optimize the energy efficiency of the network by collectively devising the RIS configuration, user scheduling, power allocation, and UAV trajectory, under a probabilistic LoS channel model. Through alternating optimization and successive convex approximation, an efficient approach is established. Simulations validate that our approach is able to significantly enhance energy efficiency by 78% in comparison with its benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework that jointly optimizes matching and dispatching processes in freight transportation, offering enhanced responsiveness, modularity, and coordination under real-time constraints. To mitigate computational demands without sacrificing matching accuracy, we present two efficient pre-filtering algorithms, PAMA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Matching Agent) and PADA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Dispatching Agent), which enhance the H3 hexagonal geospatial partitioning system.

Experimental results show that our framework improves successful match rates by 1.73%, reduces vehicle idle time by 5.7%, and maintains low empty mileage. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines including Deep Q-Network and clustering-based methods, our HRL model achieves superior reward efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic freight environments.

However, the time-varying nature of driving risks brought on by the dynamic and complicated traffic environment makes it challenging to precisely assess them. This study presents a method for measuring driving risk and establishing a unified framework for driving risk modeling. To determine the source of driving risks, we start with traffic accidents, which are abnormal energy transfers. A unified quantitative method based on the equivalent force model is proposed and analyzed in detail to design the unified driving risk modeling framework. The modeling method of an integrated driving risk model by comprehensively considering the driver-vehicle-road multifactor is obtained. We first validate the risk quantification effectiveness through simulation experiments involving multi-vehicle interactions and further verify the feasibility of the model through three natural vehicle experiments: car-following, cut-in, and intersection conflict scenarios. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested approach may determine the extent and direction of driving risks with vehicle-to-vehicle technical support. The proposed method adopts a collision warning system, which can forecast driving risk, broadcast the location of the risk in advance, and provide the driver with control suggestions to ensure driving safety.},

In practice, however, the information exchange may suffer from communication delays and packet losses due to limited communication channel bandwidth, fading, and signal interference, and this might have severe negative effects on the longitudinal control performance of CAVs. Furthermore, it is expected that mixed traffic, i.e., vehicles with different automation levels and communication capabilities (Human-driven vehicles, Connected human-driven vehicles, Autonomous vehicles, CAVs), will coexist on roads during a long transition period. This creates additional control challenges for CAVs due to the uncertainty in human’s driving behaviour. While extensive surveys on longitudinal control strategies for CAVs and their impact on traffic performance have been reported in the literature in recent years, they have assumed CAVs’ operation in unrealistic scenarios such as perfect communication, pure CAVs traffic, identical vehicle dynamics, etc. In this paper, we review the existing work on CAVs in realistic scenarios with a focus on the control strategies to address the challenges in unreliable communication and mixed-traffic environments.

A key yet unresolved challenge in content dissemination and EV charging is incentivizing vehicles to participate in collaborative processes voluntarily. Existing incentive mechanisms mainly rely on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to single-point attacks and trust issues in third-party platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the PCD-DB (Popular Content Dissemination using DAG-based Blockchain) scheme, which uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain to incentivize V2X collaboration for dual applications: improving content dissemination efficiency and ensuring secure EV charging transactions. Our novel framework establishes a decentralized incentive system where vehicles act as content propagators or charging service providers, depending on their service capabilities. We define the propagation and charging capabilities of vehicles and use contract theory to design hierarchical contracts tailored to heterogeneous vehicle roles. Numerical results show that our decentralized incentive mechanism significantly improves the efficiency and profitability of vehicle content dissemination while ensuring the security of electric vehicle charging transactions, outperforming existing benchmark methods.},

With the accessibility of more fine-grained traffic data, intersection queue lengths prediction with both high spatial and temporal resolution have become feasible, offering significant potential for applications such as dynamic and adaptive traffic management in real-time systems. However, predicting these fine-grained queue lengths is challenging due to their rapid fluctuations and the zero-inflated, long-tailed nature of the data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes CTSG-Net (Cyclic Temporal-Spatial Graph Convolution Network), capable of predicting lane-level, seconds-by-seconds queue lengths at a network scale. CTSG-Net incorporates a cyclic feature extraction module that utilizes signal cycle information to capture periodic traffic patterns, and a graph topology learning module that combines static and dynamic graph layers to model lane-specific spatial dependencies. Additionally, CTSG-Net employs a weighted loss function to further address the zero-inflated nature of queue length data. Experiments have been conducted on real-world traffic data from Yizhuang, Beijing, during both off-peak and evening peak periods. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTSG-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for off-peak and evening peak scenarios, the proposed CTSG-Net demonstrates substantial improvements of up to 8.04%, 28.23%, 24.68% in MAE and 6.54%, 27.75%, 22.12% in RMSE across dataset of all queue lengths, non-zero queue lengths, and large queue lengths ( $\ge 100$ m), respectively.

Current mobility management strategies predominantly focus on macro-level monitoring through traffic sensing infrastructure, and struggle to capture network-wide, real-time safety risks due to the limited spread of vehicle-based sensors. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-aware Predictive Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system’s innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 9.40% to 13.12% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 2.12% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations.},

However, nighttime segmentation remains underdeveloped compared to its daytime counterpart due to poor illumination and scarce annotated data, posing a significant challenge for night-scene understanding. Most current approaches mainly rely on domain adaptation technologies to transfer segmentation models trained on daytime scenes. However, the substantial distinctions between daytime and nighttime domains often hinder effective adaptation. To address this challenge, we leverage the implicit comprehensive information within nighttime data to enhance semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach. Specifically, we introduce a Semi-Supervised Comprehensive Learning (SSCL) approach, which is a unified, closed-loop learning architecture composed of three mutually reinforcing correction mechanisms: (1) unsupervised interactive correction to mitigate the risk of erroneous label propagation by leveraging complementary learning abilities; (2) unsupervised reinforcement correction, which enhances the model’s adaptability by promoting diverse learning on high-uncertainty regions through entropy-guided perturbation; (3) supervised standard correction to ensure alignment with known standards by anchoring the system to reference answers. SSCL is the first semi-supervised algorithm that jointly exploits structural diversity, uncertainty-aware supervision, and closed-loop correction to fully harness the latent potential of unlabeled nighttime data. Extensive experiments on NightCity, Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate that SSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in nighttime semantic segmentation.},

Although existing group key-based protocols provide foundational security services, they often incur substantial computation overhead and insufficiently address vehicle privacy, making them unsuitable for dynamic vehicular platoon. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient group authentication protocol (EEGAP) for dynamic vehicular platoons, which ensures privacy-preserving and secure communication during platoon restructuring operations, such as merging and splitting, by integrating anonymous authentication, fog computing, and group key agreement mechanisms. Leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secret sharing mechanisms, EEGAP enables lightweight yet robust group key negotiation, reducing computation overhead by 7.08% and communication overhead by 6.85% compared to existing schemes.

First, the HV uses a dynamic risk field method to assess the collision risk with surrounding vehicles (SVs) in real-time, integrating dynamic obstacle interactions through modified Gaussian distributions. Second, a spatiotemporal safety corridor construction scheme leverages regression-based boundaries to transform spatiotemporal requirements into manageable optimization constraints. Third, the HV adopts a contingency-aware model predictive control framework that incorporates SVs uncertainty for human-like lane changes. The formulated optimization problem is solved using sequential quadratic programming with stability and recursive feasibility. Simulations confirm that our approach ensures safety and comfort of the HV across lane changing scenarios, achieving smoother trajectories, improved stability, and enhanced safety margins, with up to 95% reductions in longitudinal and lateral accelerations and a 27% decrease in lane-changing time.},

To enhance global route planning, we construct a state-value function to represent the global map and then iterate an inheritable state-transition matrix that can be used to rapidly search globally optimal routes. To improve the safety, stability and adaptability of local motion planning, we propose an adaptive dynamic safe topological structure that combines hierarchical computational layers to decompose decision-making processes and adaptively regulate decision outputs in diverse scenarios. These methods are integrated into a unified framework for cooperative decision-making, which is validated in various scenarios in CARLA. The experimental results demonstrate that the global route planning method efficiently searches optimal routes, while the local motion planning method ensures safe and robust decisions across various driving scenarios and styles. Additionally, the integrated framework achieves effective cooperation between efficient global navigation and effective local decision-making.},

The cornerstone of our CL-AKA scheme stems from an improved certificateless signature (CLS). Specifically, we re-design the key structure of CLS, allowing signers to locally maintain a single public key (instead of two public keys in most state-of-the-art works) as well as two private keys after key generation. With such a novel key structure, the proposed CLS facilitates pairing-free signature generation and verification and realizes efficient batch verification on the verifier’s end. Moreover, a signer only needs to disseminate one public key to verifiers, thus saving communication bandwidth. In addition to the advanced CLS, we develop a CL-AKA scheme that efficiently handles network access requests from multiple vehicles at base stations. To resist physical attacks and achieve highly secure key management, we further integrate the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) into our scheme. Formal security proofs demonstrate that the proposed CL-AKA scheme is secure against conventional attacks and preserves common security properties such as forward secrecy and session key independence. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our scheme.},

However, prevalent data-driven simulations often focus on modeling individual traffic participants or indirectly representing their joint future motion distribution in a latent space. These approaches may encounter challenges due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of agents or may lack explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel learning-based traffic simulation framework aimed at directly modeling joint behaviors in the 2D plane. Our framework utilizes a graph-based scene representation to accommodate an arbitrary number of agents and road elements. It directly generates multiple joint goal sets for all agents in a given scenario and subsequently produces reference lines for each goal set. To enhance interaction with the ego, we design a predictive step simulation module to forecast the ego’s short-term motion and prevent collisions between the step rollout and the prediction during reference line tracking. Experimental results on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset validate that the proposed model can directly generate multiple socially consistent goal sets, showcasing enhancements in collision avoidance, road compliance, and overall realism. This approach shows promise in advancing the development and deployment of AD technology in a safer and more efficient manner.},

To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method.

Consequently, its evaluation becomes highly significant for public transport companies, offering valuable insights to facilitate continuous monitoring, assessment, and the implementation of targeted strategies to improve their services. Past research has primarily focused on separate assessments of on-board comfort, using both subjective and objective measurements. Even in cases in which both types of measurements were collected simultaneously, only one study has developed a one-size-fits-all, gradual scale for a real-time assessment. This paper builds upon this prior research by refining an existing framework, incorporating multiple comfort evaluation scales that consider objective measures, such as accelerations during horizontal curves, braking manoeuvres, and pavement irregularities. These measures are collected through intelligent transport system tools and are linked with the perceptions of different passenger segments on these measures gathered through surveys. The results were derived from a substantial dataset collected in an Italian case study and the implementation of three novel algorithms. Moreover, they contributed towards establishing multiple comfort scales within an actual operational environment. Furthermore, these findings are significant as these scales could serve as a valuable tool for regulating driver behaviour. In this way, each driver gains the ability to identify instances of passenger discomfort in real time and implement corrective actions to enhance overall comfort.},

However, how to effectively utilize the limited storage space of cache nodes is the main issue in current research. To address this problem, we propose an incentive-driven hierarchical collaborative caching algorithm based on D3QN combined with user preferences (PC-ID3QN). Firstly, we constructed a UAV-assisted vehicular content-centric network framework, designing different collaborative caching strategy for various layers based on user preferences. Secondly, we proposed a hierarchical incentive mechanism based on social priority to motivate users to participate in collaborative sharing, thereby enhancing the utilization of system caching resources. Next, we modeled the cache placement problem as a system utility maximization problem and proved its NP-hardness. Then, by adjusting the constraint conditions, we conducted theoretical analysis and transform it into a linear programming(LP) problem to obtain an offline theoretical solution. This solution was validated against the simulation optimal solution obtained using the proposed PC-ID3QN algorithm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the proposed caching strategy using the MovieLens dataset and conduct extensive experiments to verify the applicability and superiority of our solution in improving cache utility. Compared with DDQN, Dueling DQN and DQN, our proposed ID3QN algorithm reduces the request delay by 1.03%,1.73% and 2.21%, and reduces the energy cost by 38.8%, 19.6% and 17.2%, respectively.},

Human driving behavior shows significant heterogeneity, and aggressive driving behavior poses a significant threat to traffic safety. However, the aggressive trajectory data are usually scarce and few-shot, which makes it difficult to model. A cross-in domain transfer learning model (CIDTL) tailored for vehicular trajectory prediction under few-shot conditions of aggressive driving behavior is proposed to tackle the above challenges. CIDTL aligns cross-domain features from different road intersections and in-domain features of three types of driving behaviors, which can improve the prediction performance on few-shot samples in the target domain by leveraging sufficient data from source domains. Specifically, we develop a simple yet efficient method for driving behavior clustering, dividing trajectory data into three distinct styles. Then, CIDTL is proposed to align cross-domain features and in-domain features simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct numerical experiments on the inD dataset. The results show that accurate predictions can be achieved even with limited aggressive driving behavior data, which indicates that CIDTL can successfully reduce the distribution difference of trajectory data between ordinary driving behavior and aggressive driving behavior, as well as the difference between source domains and target domain, by learning common driving knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. The proposed model is robust and has good generalization, which expands the application scope of traditional trajectory prediction models in reality.},

However, the diversity of heterogeneous agents including pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles in traffic scenarios presents substantial challenges to this task. Current models do not fully capture the implicit and explicit interaction relationships among these heterogeneous agents and often overlook the significance of extracting implicit correlations from agent features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model for trajectory prediction: Heterogeneous Graph Structure Contrast Optimization (HGSCO). To accurately capture the interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents, HGSCO constructs semantic graph structures representing implicit relationships and meta-path graph structures representing explicit relationships. Then, HGSCO introduces a cross-view contrastive learning approach, which optimizes the heterogeneous graph structure by maximizing mutual information between the two types of graph structures. The model can provide precise interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents by effectively fusing these two graph representations with a gated fusion method. We utilized video data captured by camera sensors in complex environments with multiple agents to conduct experiments. Our proposed model achieved an 11.5% and 6.7% reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) across these datasets, respectively, and a reduction of 15.6% and 8.1% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). The results demonstrate that HGSCO significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods regarding trajectory prediction accuracy.},

This paper investigates a diffeomorphism-transformed iterative linear quadratic regulator (DTiLQR) algorithm for addressing constrained motion planning problems in autonomous vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and multiple inequality constraints. With regard to the state and input constraints, a novel state-and-input diffeomorphism is proposed to transform the constrained state/input space into an unconstrained one. Subsequently, these inequality constraints are systematically incorporated into the vehicle dynamics, thereby leading to the newly constructed system in this context. Then, we reformulate and incorporate the obstacle avoidance constraint into the objective function using state diffeomorphism and logarithmic barrier function. With this, the original optimization problem is converted to the unconstrained counterpart, adhering only to the constructed system dynamics. In this sense, featuring a streamlined single-loop architecture (which is essentially different from the dual-loop algorithmic design of existing constrained iLQR algorithms), DTiLQR is used to solve the optimization problem effectively while maintaining motion performance and constraint satisfaction for the resulting optimal trajectory. Ultimately, case studies across various driving situations showcase the effectiveness and exceptional computational efficiency of the proposed DTiLQR algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction within open social environments is a vital component of mobile robotics and autonomous driving. The inherent uncertainty and multimodality introduce considerable challenges for this task. Currently, an effective approach is to first evaluate the goal distribution of pedestrian trajectories to provide potential destinations for prediction. However, this process neglects the global perspective, weakening the global dependency among trajectory points, which can increase the divergence in the goal distribution and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) clique model method for pedestrian trajectory prediction network. In this approach, each future trajectory point is treated as a node variable, forming cliques with historical trajectory points, thereby constructing a global clique model between them. Subsequently, clique models are established in both the goal network and the prediction network. This clique-based approach enhances the ability to capture and represent complex dependency in trajectories. Additionally, to further deepen feature fusion in the prediction network, we design a fusion network based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Specifically, we propose MCK-net, which primarily includes a two-tiered clique goal module and a clique prediction module based on CK-LSTM (Clique and KAN LSTM). These designs achieve dual performance improvements in both the goal and prediction networks. Comparative experiments with various previous outstanding algorithms demonstrate that our MCK-net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all the scenes of the ETH/UCY datasets.

The various potential privacy and security concerns (such as vessels’ location tracking, message tampering, unauthorized access to data, etc.) have increased substantially in IoT-enabled MTS. Considering the above issues, we propose a secure, robust, and efficient authentication scheme for MTS based on Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) called PSAS-MTS. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme not only monitors the vessel’s condition but also ensures protection against collisions in route management and provides safety to the vessel’s passengers. The scheme uses simple XOR, a cryptographic one-way hash, an ECC cryptosystem, and HMAC to achieve a high level of security in MTS. The formal security analysis is carried out using a well-known Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, which ensures the security harness features. A rigorous informal security analysis is also done, which ensures various privacy and security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, forward and backward secrecy, etc. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme resists various possible well-known active and passive security attacks. The performance analysis shows that the proposed PSAS-MTS scheme is more efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads when compared to other competitive schemes.},

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent transportation systems, vehicles are exposed to a complex network environment. As the mainstream in-vehicle network (IVN), the controller area network (CAN) has many potential security hazards. Existing deep learning-based intrusion detection methods have security performance advantages, however, they consume too much resources and are therefore not suitable to be directly implemented into the IVN. In this paper, we explore computational resource allocation schemes in the IVNs and propose the LiPar, which is a parallel neural network structure using lightweight multi-dimensional spatial and temporal feature fusion learning to perform intrusion detection tasks in the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment. In particular, LiPar adaptively allocates task loads to in-vehicle computing devices, such as multiple electronic control units, domain controllers, and computing gateways by evaluating whether a computing device is suitable to undertake the branch computing tasks according to its real-time resource occupancy. Experiment results show that LiPar achieves better detection performance, running efficiency, and optimized lightweight model size over existing methods, and can be well adapted to the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment and practically protect the in-vehicle CAN bus security.

  abstract     = {For intelligent vehicles, accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is an important basis for identifying potential risks in advance and making optimal decisions. However, unsignalized roundabouts have multiple entrance and exit ramps with uncertain angles and numbers, which leads to more diverse driving intentions and more complex multi-vehicle interactions of surrounding vehicles, which significantly reduces the accuracy of trajectory prediction and even causes wrong decisions and serious collision accidents. To this end, this paper innovatively proposes a method for predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in unsignalized roundabouts based on global-local historical information fusion (TP-GLIF). From a global perspective, a scene-adaptive dynamic and static feature information encoder is constructed, and a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to capture environmental information closely related to driving intention, so that the model always focuses on the dynamic and static features that are most beneficial to improving prediction accuracy. From a local perspective, a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph attention multi-vehicle interaction encoder is constructed, and a novel hierarchical Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model-support vector machine driving intention recognition algorithm is designed to guide prediction decoding. A long short-term decoder LS-GRU is designed to decode the surrounding vehicle trajectories under the influence of complex road structure features, complex multi-vehicle interaction features and diverse driving intention features in different time periods to reduce the cumulative error. Experimental results show that TP-GLIF can achieve accurate trajectory prediction in different roundabout scenes, and has good computational efficiency and generalization ability.},

Due to the coupling between problem complexity and the number of surrounding obstacles, existing methods often suffer from increased computation time and failure rates in dense environments. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient parking trajectory planner with fast obstacle retrieval capability. The proposed planner follows a classical two-stage architecture consisting of front-end trajectory generation and back-end trajectory optimization. In the first stage, a multi-resolution sampling-based trajectory generation method is introduced. By using multi-resolution sampling strategy and a KD-Tree-based collision detection algorithm, the method achieves high-quality initial trajectory while maintaining computational efficiency. In the second stage, we present a novel iterative trajectory optimization method based on neighbor obstacle indexing, which restricts the scale of obstacle constraints during each optimization iteration, which improves computational efficiency of trajectory optimization. Extensive comparative studies and real-car experiments are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in terms of computation time and robustness in complex, cluttered environments.},

Predicting and mitigating cybersickness is crucial for creating safer and more comfortable VR experiences. This study introduces a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit-attention (1CNN–GRU–Attention) model trained on galvanic skin response (GSR) data collected from 24 participants in VR under various weather conditions. Participants reported cybersickness severity on a 10-point scale every minute, providing real-time labels for evaluation. The model’s performance was compared with that of k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in binary (two-class) and multi-class (four-class: none, low, acute, high) classification settings, both with and without class balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Evaluation metrics included accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and unified performance metric (UPM), with performance assessed via 5-fold cross-validation and statistical t-tests. Results show that the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model significantly outperforms both SVM and KNN across all metrics. Applying SMOTE improved binary classification accuracy from 75.15% to 86.94% in binary classification and from 48.77% to 64.63% in multiclass classification, with notable improvements in MCC. These findings highlight the importance of balanced data and the effectiveness of the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model in assessing cybersickness severity, advancing physiological monitoring methods for VR, and facilitating broader VR adoption.},

  abstract     = {Four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction plays a critical role in modern air traffic management, enabling applications such as conflict detection, anomaly monitoring, and congestion mitigation. However, existing methods have limited information sources when modeling potential spatial correlations between aircraft in complex airspace scenarios, and their final trajectory inference ability is weak, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Faced with these challenges, we propose Modern Temporal and Dual Attention based Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (MTDA-STGCN), which employs a self-attention mechanism to reconstruct the adjacency matrix to enhance the ability of capturing global node correlations. This adjacency matrix reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism is dynamically optimized throughout the training process of network, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. Subsequently, our model uses graph attention to extract additional global features for modeling accuracy interactions between aircraft. Finally, the output is input into the Modern Temporal Prediction Network (MTPN) to obtain the predicted trajectory probability distribution. The experiments on real-world ADS-B datasets demonstrate that MTDA-STGCN outperforms existing 4D trajectory prediction algorithms on all datasets. The proposed dual-attention framework significantly enhances the capture of node spatial correlations, while the MTPN module effectively improves the accuracy of the predicted results.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges in network anomaly detection, such as data label imbalance and the poor performance of traditional Support Vector Machines (SVM) in fitting high-dimensional, large-sample datasets, this paper proposes a novel framework for network anomaly detection. The core contribution is the proposal of a Fuzzy Granular Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) based on fuzzy granular vectors. FGSVM constructs fuzzy granular vectors by performing fuzzy granulation on data features, thereby comprehensively capturing both local feature distributions and global data characteristics. This method granulates all data, avoiding the information loss caused by sample compression in traditional methods. To further optimize model performance, this paper also introduces a Noise-Aware Hybrid Weighted Sampling (NA-HWS) method, which optimizes the data distribution by purifying the data and applying weighted sampling to critical boundary regions. This approach combines with FGSVM to form the more powerful S-FGSVM model. Comprehensive experimental results on several internationally recognized benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, and UNSW-NB15, confirm the significant superiority of the proposed methods. The S-FGSVM model demonstrated outstanding performance on all key metrics, significantly surpassing most baseline algorithms, including both deep learning and classic machine learning models. Compared to deep learning models, which generally have high computational overhead, the model proposed in this study shows a significant advantage in computational efficiency, achieving an ideal balance between detection performance and operational efficiency.},

We are, therefore, motivated to consider the problem of platooning control with mismatched disturbances, for which we propose a distributed adaptive backstepping control approach. The main challenges are 1) ensuring the internal and string stability of the platoon, 2) maintaining the compositionality and the distributed nature of the controller, and 3) ensuring the robustness of the controller with respect to general types of disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a novel notion named Vector String Lyapunov Functions, whose existence implies $l_{2}$ weak string stability. This notion is based on the vector Lyapunov function-based stability analysis, which depends on the input-to-state stability of a comparison system. Using this notion, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping controller for the platoon to ensure the controller’s compositionality and distributed nature. At the same time, the closed-loop system’s internal stability and string stability are formally guaranteed. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-enabled security mechanisms play a crucial role in Maritime Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITSs). However, the growing dependence on network communication and data exchange raises serious privacy concerns. While numerous authentication schemes exist for MITSs to prevent unauthorized access, most exhibit limited scalability, high computational costs, and vulnerability to physical attacks, hindering their practical implementation. Still, the transmission of authentication information relies on open networks, exposing the system to diverse network attacks. To cope with these issues, a blockchain-enabled security architecture with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and consensus-based intrusion detection system (BPSAC) is proposed to protect privacy and ensure resilience against various network attacks. The architecture comprises a security authentication mechanism and a novel consensus-based intrusion detection system (C-IDS). Specifically, the security authentication mechanism mitigates performance overhead and privacy concerns by introducing PUFs. Subsequently, C-IDS is designed for intrusion detection without sacrificing the security of the model inference process by introducing a Differential Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) module, and an enhanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm named MI-PBFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security authentication mechanism reduces the computational overhead by at least 20% and the communication overhead by 5% compared to recent works. The proposed detection model achieves an attack detection accuracy of over 99% on the UNSW-NB15, KDDCup99, and NSL-KDD datasets. Furthermore, as the number of consensus nodes increases, MI-PBFT consensus algorithm reduces the transaction confirmation delay by 32% and improves the transactions per second by 80% compared to PBFT.},

This approach ensures electric vehicles (EVs) maintain optimal power output and range performance. However, due to the prolonged battery heat accumulation, effective optimization requires a long predictive horizon. The real-time implementation of centralized model predictive control (MPC) faces challenges in computational complexity. To address this, the proposed bipartite integration optimization strategy combines two levels for cabin and battery thermal management, enhancing computational efficiency through a segmented, hierarchical optimization approach. A comprehensive thermal model for the cooling system is developed, employing a combination of liquid cooling and active air cooling. In the upper level, vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication is utilized to obtain the average vehicle velocity over a long horizon, enabling more accurate forecasts of power demand and thermal load, thereby optimizing the thermal trajectory. In the lower level, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is used to predict future vehicle velocity over a short horizon, facilitating precise temperature tracking and minimizing variations for optimal control. Simulation results under real driving conditions indicate that the proposed strategy reduces energy consumption by 18.90%, improves computational efficiency by 83.53%, and results in a 0.055% improvement in battery state of health (SOH) over extended cycles, without compromising the cooling requirements of the passenger cabin.},

First, in order to solve the problem that traditional methods are prone to deviate from the true trajectory during the prediction of large-scale circular arc trajectories, this paper proposes an AIS-UKF method that considers angular acceleration and linear acceleration, so that the predicted trajectory is more biased towards the inside of the arc and is suitable for the kinematic laws of most heterogeneous subsystems. At the same time, DDPG training is used to obtain the most appropriate number of incremental steps required for different states. Then, in order to avoid DDPG from repeatedly selecting the same wrong action during training and testing, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise based on a real physical model is proposed as the strategy selection noise of the DDPG model to increase the richness of action selection. In addition, a trusted interactive multi-model method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) enhancement is proposed, which enables the method to adapt to more complex surface environment and rely on generative artificial intelligence instead of traditional expert experience to generate process noise covariance matrix of each model. The feasibility and innovation of the proposed algorithm are verified by practical training data acquisition and real-time prediction experiments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient trajectory planning in Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) remains challenging due to multiple vehicle interactions and environmental complexities. Existing single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face challenges in balancing complexity, convergence, and knowledge efficiency, often resulting in increased collisions and longer travel times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Bio-inspired Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (BERL) framework for multi-vehicle collaborative trajectory planning, where each vehicle is modeled as a Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition Network (FALCON) agent based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). The BERL framework comprises three core modules: 1) Meme Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which enables agents to learn independently and adapt to changing environments; 2) Expert-Guided Evolutionary Learning (EGEL), which facilitates knowledge transfer from expert agents to less experienced ones, enhancing coordination; and 3) Integrated Forgetting and Memory Optimization (IFMO), which optimizes memory use and reduces algorithm complexity. Additionally, the BERL framework supports model and sensor quality heterogeneity in the multi-vehicle trajectory planning scenario. Finally, we build an AVP Simulation (AVPS) platform to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the BERL framework improves success rate and parking efficiency by at least 15.7% and 16.7%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, the proposed IFMO module reduces the number of memes in the FALCON agent by 30.2% while maintaining stable performance.},

However, current research lacks comprehensive solutions for optimizing AAV path planning that can adapt to real-time changes in public transportation schedules while avoiding dynamically changing high-interference zones, ensuring consistent drone connectivity, and accounting for limited drone battery life. This paper addresses these gaps by optimizing and balancing multiple objectives, such as ensuring early arrival, minimizing energy consumption, and reducing signal interference. To achieve these goals, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm for real-time path optimization, ensuring path adaptability to random changes in interference zones and public transportation schedules, and compare its performance against multi-objective A* algorithm variants. Results show that Q-learning achieves superior early arrival times, energy efficiency, and reduced interference, with a nearly 100% success rate in package deliveries, compared to 60-80% for A*. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of Q-learning in AAV-Aided Public Transportation systems, making it a valuable solution for real-world urban delivery challenges.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Connected Vehicle (CV) technology have prompted research on leveraging CV data for more effective traffic management. However, existing studies on CV-based signal control share a common shortcoming in that they all ignore traffic flow estimation errors in their modeling process, which is inevitable due to the sampling observation nature of CVs. This study proposes a CV data-driven robust optimization framework for traffic signal timing, accounting for both traffic flow variability and estimation errors. First, we propose a general CV data-driven deterministic optimization model (CV-DO) that can be widely applied to various scenarios, including under-/over-saturated and fixed-/real-time signalized intersections. Then, we propose a novel CV data-driven uncertainty set of arrival rates, circumventing the error-prone estimation process and accounting for both traffic flow variability errors. Finally, a CV data-driven robust optimization model (CV-RO) is formulated to explicitly handle arrival rate uncertainties. Employing the robust counterpart approach, this robust optimization problem can be converted to deterministic mixed-integer linear programming problems that can be solved efficiently with exact solutions. The evaluation results at a real-world intersection highlight the superior performance of the CV-RO model compared to the deterministic model and traditional methods across various scenarios. At different levels of traffic flow fluctuations, CV-RO can reduce delays by 5-26% compared to CV-DO at fixed-time signalized intersections with 0.1 CV penetration rate. The results on a real-time signalized network show that CV-RO can reduce 5% delays compared to the CV-DO model and 35.5% delays compared to actuated control at a 0.3 penetration rate.},

Traditional loop detection methods, primarily relying on appearance similarity and geometric consistency of local features, often struggle to distinguish true loops in visually similar artificial environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel trajectory-based spatial verification approach, utilizing covariance propagation of odometry and loop estimation, to effectively reduce false positives in loop detection due to visual ambiguities. We further develop a comprehensive loop detection framework that seamlessly integrates appearance similarity, geometric consistency, and the proposed trajectory-based spatial similarity, extending its applicability to both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Additionally, we introduce covariance-based pose graph optimization to fully utilize the reliability of relative transformation between loop keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves loop detection accuracy by 25.50% on average and reduces absolute trajectory error by 0.408 meters, demonstrating its effectiveness in highly confusing environments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of V2V and V2I communication technologies and autonomous control systems, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining increasing popularity. Small-spacing AV platoons offer advantages such as enhanced road capacity and energy efficiency. However, in non-ideal communication environments, packet loss can cause partial loss of trajectory information, resulting in discontinuous tracking. This may induce significant transients and trigger actuator saturation, aggravating traffic disturbances. In bidirectional platoons, where control signals propagate in both directions, the impact of such disruptions is further amplified due to mutual vehicle interdependence. This paper addresses these challenges by considering asymmetric actuator saturation, discontinuous tracking trajectories, and non-zero initial spacing errors in bidirectional AV platoons. A continuous control law is designed based on coupled sliding mode control, and Lyapunov stability theory is employed to ensure both trajectory tracking stability and string stability. Our contributions include the development of a modified spacing policy that not only eliminates large transients and string instability caused by non-zero initial spacing errors but also ensures rapid convergence to the desired spacing within a finite and adjustable time frame. Furthermore, a variant sigmoid function is introduced to actively smooth the discontinuous tracking trajectories, thereby reducing communication demands and suppressing transients. An auxiliary system is also designed to manage actuator saturation effectively, ensuring provable stability and fully leveraging actuator capabilities. Results demonstrate that the control strategy achieves both trajectory tracking stability and string stability, while also enabling rapid tracking performance and maintaining small spacing errors by making full use of actuator potential.},

A major challenge is the shortest-path planning problem of a curvature-bounded vehicle from the known starting configuration to visit a target point and finally return to the starting configuration in an obstacle environment. Spurred by this significant issue in robotic surveillance and patrolling applications, this paper proposed the Two-trip Obstacle-environment Relaxed Dubins Problem (TORDP). In TORDP, the vehicle’s target-visiting heading is a critical variable. Analytical approaches have existed for simpler scenarios than TORDP. However, these approaches are unavailable when solving the complex TORDP simultaneously with bounded curvature, variable target heading and unified ability to tackle with- or without- obstacle cases. Hence, we develop the mixed-integer piecewise-linear program (MIPWLP) approach, making the otherwise intractable complex scenario unifiedly solved with guaranteed good quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach demonstrates effective performance. Furthermore, the objective approximation error in some cases was analyzed to achieve a length near the optimal length within $h^{2}/(2\sqrt {2})$ tolerance where h is the approximation piece length. The proposed MIPWLP approach could also offer a generalizable optimization framework for broader robotic path-planning applications in constrained environments.},

Moreover, these models are usually trained in a centralized manner, which raises data privacy concerns and relies on the unrealistic assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data across all vehicles and environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight network, termed Privacy-aware Efficient Generalization Network (PEGNet), that preserves user privacy and improves cross-scenario generalization. Specifically, this network incorporates a Lightweight Adaptive Enhancement (LAE) module with deformable convolutions to efficiently capture multi-scale features under strict resource constraints. We further employ a federated learning framework to collaboratively train the model across distributed IoV nodes with limited local data, thereby significantly reducing per-node computation while safeguarding user data privacy. To enhance the robustness of non-IID data, we introduce a Moment Distance loss (MDloss) that prompts the model to adapt to diverse traffic scenes.

This study proposes a classification method for inherent driving styles and develops a proactive prediction framework for cut-in risk, which is validated and analyzed using wide-area trajectory data. The results indicate that: (a) the indicator system constructed based on car-following, lane-changing, and interaction characteristics effectively captures inherent driving traits, and the recognition model performs well when the number of style clusters is set to three; (b) the cut-in risk prediction model developed using LightGBM achieves optimal predictive performance, with a fixed observation window and a 2-second lead time offering the most practical feasibility for proactive warning applications; (c) incorporating inherent driving style into the model reduces the prediction error by 3.9% and supports more targeted decision-making.

However, V2X networks often face channel congestion due to limited communication resources, which seriously threatens road safety. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method based on dynamic graph neural networks, which achieves dynamic management and optimization of channel congestion through multi-agent collaborative control. First, a high-dimensional state representation is constructed by utilizing an observation encoder to process the vehicle’s data, which encompasses communication data such as transmission rates and traffic data (e.g., speed and direction). Second, a multi-head adaptive attention mechanism focuses on the important interaction information between vehicles from multiple perspectives, thereby capturing channel busy areas and potential congestion hotspots. Third, a dynamic graph neural network is used to construct a vehicle information interaction graph in real-time by fusing the local and global vehicle information through multilayer graph convolution. Then, a multi-agent actor–critic algorithm is used for intelligent decision-making and strategy optimization. Through the combination of global joint optimization and local real-time decision-making within the multi-agent paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution, vehicles can learn optimal channel allocation and behavior control strategies in the complex V2X network environment. Finally, the experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of the channel busy rate and collision avoidance rate.},

While the optimization of communication and computation resources is broadly addressed in literature, storage, a significant source of latency in the computing stack, is often ignored in existing works. Thus, in this paper, we optimize the communication and computation resources together with the storage resources to minimize the latency of VEC applications. The problem of jointly minimizing communication, computation, and storage latency under practical constraints is NP-hard. Hence, we employ dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation to achieve a computationally viable solution for the joint communication, computing, and storage resource allocation to VEC applications. To this end, we define a dual problem of the assignment of VEC applications to base stations. This problem corresponds to the perfect matching problem in a weighted bipartite graph and optimally solvable by algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. Then, as the solution to the dual problem may violate some constraints of the main resource allocation problem, we find a feasible solution to the main resource allocation problem using Lagrangian relaxation. We show that the joint optimization of all three aspects, i.e., communication, computation, and storage, reduces the overall offloading latency up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art works.},

In response, this paper proposes the Sharebility Graph-based Restricted Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (SG-RALNS) algorithm for dynamic reassignment of vehicle routes. The core idea is to balance passenger experience and corporate profits by restricting reassignment parameters. Additionally, this work integrates the application of the Sharebility Graph (SG), including the design of insertion and deletion operators tailored for intercity travel. The performance of the algorithm is validated through real-world datasets, with quantitative results showing our algorithm can increase company profits by around 1% to 48%. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm framework is also applicable to other long-distance, high-capacity ridesharing scenarios, such as rural ride-sharing.},

  abstract     = {Implicit authentication for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) refers to the continuous and transparent identity verification of users by utilizing various vehicle intelligent terminals to collect the user’s behavioral characteristics as authentication factors, ensuring that the connected vehicle remains under the control of a legitimate user at all times. Existing research on implicit authentication mainly focuses on enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the system, but ignores the privacy protection of user behavior characteristics. Since behavioral characteristics involve extremely sensitive personal information, it is imperative to design efficient and secure privacy protection protocols. However, there is currently little research that relies on cryptographic technology to ensure a high level of security while achieving efficient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a provably secure privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol for implicit authentication in a semi-honest and non-colluding dual-cloud environment, where Weighted MinHash and Jaccard similarity are combined for the first time in an implicit authentication framework to achieve effective privacy protection. Weighted MinHash is used to process multimodal behavioral features, which not only solves the problem of behavioral feature exposure but also reduces the computational cost; while Jaccard similarity is used to evaluate the differences between features. The security of the proposed protocol is proven by cryptographic methods, i.e., using formal and informal security analysis as well as the formal security analysis tool AVISPA. Furthermore, the experimental verification and comparative analysis, e.g., the time complexity and communication bandwidth of connected vehicles, demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective and practical. In contrast with the most advanced scheme, the time complexity and the communication bandwidth are decreased from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(nm)(m\lt n)$ and from $256qn^{2}+4096$ to $768qm$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurate path tracking control is crucial for the performance of autonomous vehicle (AV). However, a single control algorithm struggles to adapt to complex dynamic scenarios with varying error states and path curvatures, leading to challenges in slow convergence and poor tracking performance. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion control scheme termed AMPIPPO that integrates an attention mechanism and a physical information model into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). First, FLnSM and NMPC are combined through PPO by balancing the two controllers. Then, the attention mechanism is incorporated to utilize error information and path curvature as state inputs for generating action outputs, significantly enhancing the adaptability of PPO. Additionally, physical information (PI) is implemented to strengthen both model-driven and data-driven approaches, achieving an accurate model estimation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the convergence of policy iterations in the AMPIPPO algorithm. Finally, a control scheme FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO is proposed to achieve accurate tracking and enhance the adaptability of AV in dynamic scenarios. Compared to single controllers, the FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO method exhibits higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence. Compared to other RL, AMPIPPO demonstrates superior performance in sparse data scenarios and significantly enhances AV prediction accuracy. The proposed FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO demonstrates excellent performance through numerical simulations and experiments.},

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and the predictor to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, ablation studies, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://github.com/RWLinno/STUM},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching, as a vital depth perception technology, has garnered considerable attention in autonomous driving systems, a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still faces severe challenges in achieving high accuracy in complex traffic regions and real-time efficiency, which directly compromises the decision-making safety of autonomous driving systems and the reliability of the entire intelligent transportation system. To address the above challenges, we propose a Geometry-gated Offset Correction Stereo Matching Network (Go-Stereo), comprising three core modules: a Geometry-aware Enhancement Module (GAE), an Iterative Gated Refinement Network (IGR), and an Offset Correction Network (OCN). GAE generates geometry-aware weights through a Channel-spatial Attention and applies them to filter the disparity cost volume. This enables the network to more effectively capture and utilize geometric cues in the scene, thereby improving its robustness to complex structures and low-texture areas. IGR constructs context cost volumes and uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for iterative updates, achieving sub-pixel disparity refinement at a lower computational cost. Finally, OCN locates occlusion and edge regions by combining uncertainty estimation methods, and achieves precise adjustment of error regions through point-to-point and iterative offset correction strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that on the SceneFlow dataset, compared to Light-Stereo, the End-Point Error (EPE) was reduced by 8% (0.47 vs. 0.51) while the parameter count was decreased by 89% (5.02M vs. 45.63M). Furthermore, our method also achieves competitive accuracy on the KITTI 2015 dataset, with a D1-all error rate of 1.79%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/xmy-Li/Go-Stereo.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is a crucial aspect of modern traffic management and has been a research focus for decades. Unlike the forecasting of traffic flow, speed, and demand, traffic accidents occur irregularly and are highly unpredictable. As a result, developing theory-based methods for traffic accident prediction is particularly challenging. In this study, we model the occurrence of traffic accidents as a Spatial-Temporal Point Process (STPP). First, we decompose the intensity function of the STPP into a Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) and a conditional spatial distribution. To manage both discrete and continuous historical information, we propose a contextual embedding module utilizing multi-head self-attention. The TPP is then modeled as a Hawkes Process, with the intensity function generated by neural networks. Afterwards, we employ a score-based diffusion model to learn the conditional spatial distribution. In addition, we introduce a co-prediction module to forecast the severity and duration of future accidents. We verify the effectiveness of our model based on real-world traffic accident datasets from three cities. The results demonstrate that our model can capture the complicated spatial-temporal patterns of traffic accidents well and outperform current approaches.},

The transition from automated to manual driving is a challenging task that requires the driver to take over control of the ADS-equipped vehicle in a safe and timely manner. Previous studies have identified various variables associated with driver reactions, but a comprehensive classification is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by systematically identifying and classifying the independent and dependent variables that affect drivers’ reactions in ADS-equipped vehicles during the transition from automated to manual driving. This is achieved through an extensive review of major findings in the designs of driving simulator experiments in this field. Additionally, an analysis of five hundred on-road collision reports from 2014 to 2023 involving ADS-equipped test vehicles is conducted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the identified dependent and independent variables from both studies, along with their synergies and shortcomings, is presented. The variables are categorised and mapped, highlighting key research gaps. The main research gaps were identified by comparing the variables extracted from reviewed papers with the statistical analysis in the DMV reports. Some gaps include the need for incorporating real-world scenarios into experiments, driver-initiated take-over requests and applying physiological measures to assess driver-centric factors. This detailed identification and classification of variables assists in designing a range of future experimental scenarios to assess drivers’ reactions to the transition of control in ADS-equipped vehicles.},

By alternating between GNSS data and LiDAR-based localization depending on GNSS signal availability, the framework addresses the challenges of GNSS-denied environments while leveraging sparse GNSS signals when available. A newly developed dataset of 360-degree snow pole images, captured using an Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR sensor, demonstrates the system’s applicability for autonomous driving.

However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants’ motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to accurately replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants’ motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate that the subjective (reported) motion sickness is well reproduced with an insignificant reduction on the track. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial authentication technology at the physical layer, Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) enhances the reliability and privacy of traffic communication, thereby improving the security of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Currently, deep learning-based SEI (DL-SEI) with powerful feature extraction has become a research focal point. Most DL-SEI methods rely on high-quality datasets, which require sufficient samples and accurate labelling. However, with the trend of increasing the scale of datasets, the limited availability of labeled data and the presence of labeling noise are unavoidable, leading to a reduction in their robustness. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a noise-robust SEI (NR-SEI), which effectively takes advantage of limited data while mitigating the effects of label noise. Specifically, NR-SEI employs the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) as a global cleanliness measure, combined with k-means clustering to partition input samples into clean and noisy subsets. A robust semi-supervised learning framework is then designed to leverage both clean and noisy samples. For clean samples, label optimization is performed by combining predictions from both clean and frequency-domain augmented samples, followed by temperature sharpening to reduce over-reliance on clean labels. For noisy samples, the high-confidence pseudo-label and pseudo-label smoothing strategies are used to reduce the negative impact of label noise on model training. In comparative experiments on both Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets, the proposed NR-SEI outperforms all existing approaches. NR-SEI maintains notable performance even when faced with 80% unlabeled data and asymmetric label noise. For the ADS-B dataset, NR-SEI can achieve accuracies of 95.51% and 86.44% when the noise ratios are 20% and 40%, respectively. For the AIS dataset, it achieves 94.83% and 94.06% accuracies at the corresponding noise levels.},

Firstly, a conditional random field-based probabilistic module was employed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic pedestrians. Based on this assessment, a risk avoidance decision-making mechanism with personalized risk preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) is designed to accommodate various driver needs. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic control model is developed. All model parameters in this study are calibrated using real-world traffic data. Extensive validation confirms safety and risk preference adaptability. The results show that the proposed framework effectively reduces collision risks in diverse scenarios and outperforms other commonly-used methods. Additionally, driving simulation experiments reveal that participants report higher levels of perceived safety, comfort, usability, and overall acceptability compared to conventional automatic emergency braking systems and existing risk-aware deep reinforcement learning methods.

However, poor driving decisions and low sample efficiency for multiple DRL coupled training hinder its applications in driving decision-making models. This article proposes an innovative framework to combine two different DRL algorithms as the upper- and lower-layer planner to make car-following and lane-changing decisions respectively. The upper- and lower-layer models are trained simultaneously, and the double-layer model outputs a composite driving action. In the upper-layer model, using TD3 algorithm generates continuous vehicle speed. This article proposes the action exploration mechanism where the TD3 algorithm selects one of two action policies with a probability and then outputs an action value in the early training phase. Moreover, the proposed Q-value auxiliary networks guide our upper-layer algorithm to compute the Q-value based on a Q-value from the trained TD3 algorithm. Dueling-double DQN is used to address the issue of how a vehicle changes lanes in the lower-layer model and to output discrete values to instruct the vehicle to change lanes. To validate our model in autonomous driving applications, different training and testing scenarios simulating expressways are designed through SUMO. The experiments show that our methods address the difficulty of coupling training for the integrated model and improve its performance under different traffic flow scenarios.

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is a fundamental task in transportation research, however, the scope of current research has mainly focused on a single data modality of loop detectors. Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have enabled novel solutions to efficient, accurate, and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drones can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates urban traffic prediction from a novel perspective, where multiple input sources, i.e., loop detectors and drones, are utilized to predict both the segment-level traffic of all road segments and the regional traffic. A simple yet effective graph-based model, Hierarchical Multi-Source Neural Network (HiMSNet), is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestion and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverage and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.},

  abstract     = {End-to-end autonomous driving with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) encounters significant challenges in security and safety, which are critical for the automotive industry's adoption of autonomous technologies. This paper introduces a novel intrusion response system (IRS), called the control command utility-based IRS (CCU), specifically designed for DRLbased autonomous systems. The CCU provides a lightweight yet powerful defense against false data injection attacks on the invehicle CAN (control area network) bus, enhancing both security and driving performance by making intelligent, context-aware decisions based on control command utilities derived from DRL outputs. We rigorously evaluated CCU against other state-ofthe-art IRSs based on DRL autonomous driving models, Rails and Roach. Equipped with an additional confidence score-based filter, CCU effectively minimizes false alarms, demonstrating superior performance in improving critical driving metrics such as driving score, route completion, and infraction penalties, all while lowering defense costs. Furthermore, CCU exhibits robust resilience in hostile environments with varying attack probabilities, underscoring its reliability in complex scenarios. This contribution represents a significant advancement in autonomous driving, addressing essential security and safety challenges and accelerating the path toward safer, more reliable autonomous vehicle deployment.},

  abstract     = {In a cloud-edge collaborative environment, especially for the Internet of Vehicles, federated learning (FL) has garnered widespread attention due to its unique training process, where users solely upload trained parameters yet do not transmit their local data, demonstrating that FL is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, FL still faces challenges, such as the local gradients and global parameters (i.e., global model, global weights, or global gradients) transmitted by users may leak the users' private information, and malicious or lazy aggregation servers may forge or tamper with the parameters uploaded by users, thereby generating incorrect aggregated results, ultimately reducing the availability of the global model. Moreover, network fluctuations or device failures may cause user dropouts during training. Although existing works address these challenges, privacy protection schemes based on complex cryptographic primitives are costly and lack research on protecting global parameters. Additionally, verification schemes for aggregation results face overhead and security challenges. For such, we propose a lightweight secure aggregation and efficient verification scheme for federated learning, namely SAEV-FL. We design a single-masking protocol based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and perturbation technique to achieve privacy protection for local gradients and global parameters with lower overhead. To verify the correctness of the aggregated results, we have combined homomorphic hash functions and random number technology to design a secure verification mechanism that does not disclose users' privacy. Detailed theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments establish that the proposed scheme outperforms other similar works in terms of security and efficiency.},

Contrary to the traditional normal texts, they present the characteristics such as short length, only having few labeled data, high-velocity, high-volume and dynamic data distributions, which deteriorate the issues of data sparseness, label missing and concept drift. Obviously, it is a huge challenge for existing short text (stream) classification algorithms due to the poor effectiveness, where they always assume all short texts are completely labeled and little attention is paid on the concept drift issue hidden in short text streams. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised short text steam classification method based on the drift-aware incremental deep learning ensemble model. Specifically, with the sliding window mechanism, we firstly fuse three types of statistical, semantic and structure information to solve the data sparseness issue. Secondly, a semi-supervised incremental deep learning ensemble model based on GCN and the refined LSTM is developed to adapt to the high-volume, high-velocity and label missing short text streams. Thirdly, a label-probability distribution based concept drift detector is introduced to distinguish concept drifts. Finally, as compared with eleven well-known classification methods, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the handling of short text streams with limited labeled data.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering (MVC) has demonstrated impressive performance due to its ability to capture both consistency and diversity information among views. However, most existing techniques assume that all views are available in advance, making them inadequate for stream-view data, such as in intelligent transportation systems and medical imaging analysis, where memory constraints or privacy concerns prevent storing all previous views. Although some methods attempt to address this issue by capturing consistency information, they often fail to effectively extract diversity information and cross-view relationships. We argue that these limitations are inherent to incremental multi-view clustering (IMVC), as the inability to retain all previous views inevitably leads to insufficient information utilization, thereby compromising performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Incremental Multi-View Clustering with Cross-View Correlation and Diversity (CDIMVC). Unlike existing methods that only retain consistency information, CDIMVC also preserves diversity information and utilizes similarity matrices to capture cross-view relationships. To implement this method, we develop three key modules: the dynamic view correlation analysis module (DVCAM), the knowledge extraction module (KEM), and the knowledge transfer module (KTM). When a new data view arrives, DVCAM first assesses its importance and correlation with historical views. Subsequently, KEM computes its consistency and diversity information by comparing it to those in the knowledge base. Finally, KTM facilitates the effective transmission of past knowledge, preventing the loss of historical information. By integrating these modules, CDIMVC can effectively capture cross-view relationships and diversity information, facilitating efficient knowledge updating and maintenance. An alternating procedure is also designed to optimize the resulting optimization problem. Experimental results show that CDIMVC exceeds state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling stream-view data.},

Existing methods employ the historical reviews of customer and product to provide useful clues for the target summary generation. However, most of the existing methods indiscriminately model the historical reviews of customer and product. Since the historical customer reviews provide the personal information while the historical product reviews provide the commonly focused aspect of the product, these two types of heterogeneous information should be separately modeled. Moreover, the review rating of the historical reviews can be seen as a high-level abstraction of the customer preference and product which have been ignored by most of the existing methods. In this paper, we propose the Heterogeneous Historical Review aware Review Summarization (HHRRS) which separately models the two types of historical reviews with the rating information by a graph reasoning module with a contrastive loss. We employ a multi-task paradigm that conducts the review sentiment classification and summarization (GRARS) to model the two types of heterogeneous information in a fine-grained manner. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of HHRRS on both tasks.},

Accurately recovering these temporal processes is of significant scientific value-for example, in elucidating the mechanisms underlying protein interaction evolution. However, existing methods typically assume access to partially time-stamped networks and often struggle to generalize across domains. They perform poorly in recovering edge generation times in static networks without temporal annotations. To address this challenge, we propose a comparative paradigm that enables cross-network learning by jointly training on multiple temporal networks. This framework captures structural-temporal correlations that generalize across networks and improves accuracy by 16.98% on average compared to separate training strategies. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of real temporal data, we introduce a novel diffusion-based generative model for producing Augmented Temporal Networks (ATNs) . By integrating both real and generated samples during training, our joint strategy yields an additional 5.46% improvement in predictive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of data augmentation in enhancing generalization.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) are designed to suggest relevant items to users by analyzing their interaction sequences. However, SRSs often suffer from exposure bias in these sequences due to imbalanced item exposure and varied user activity levels, creating a self-reinforcing loop favoring popular items regardless of their true relevance. Most SRSs only focus on item dependencies to address exposure bias, while overlooking user-side exposure bias and the rich semantics behind interactions. These oversights result in a limited understanding of less active users' preferences and inaccurate preference capture for less exposed items, exacerbating exposure biases. Towards this end, we propose a novel method LLM-enhanced Dual Propensity Score Estimation (LDPE), which synergistically integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal inference. First, LDPE leverages LLMs' superior ability in capturing rich semantics from textual data and then integrates collaborative information to generate debiased semantic-rich LLM-based user/item embeddings. With these debiased item/user embeddings, LDPE estimates time-aware debiased propensity scores from both the item and user sides. These dual propensity scores can fully mitigate exposure bias by considering item popularity, user activity levels, and temporal dynamics. Lastly, LDPE employs the transformer as the backbone of our method, incorporating estimated dual propensity scores for accurately predicting users' true preferences. Extensive experiments show that our LDPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation performance.},

This paper proposes a novel oversampling framework called TMACO (Class Alliance-Constrained Oversampling), which integrates data complexity considerations into both seed selection and sample generation. First, TMACO selects seed sample units using a class alliance constraint that jointly considers spatial geometry and class distribution to enhance diversity and representativeness. Second, it generates synthetic samples based on three-point units to ensure regional stability. Third, a region-level filtering mechanism is applied to prevent synthetic samples from intruding into majority class areas. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that TMACO consistently improves minority class performance and overall classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art oversampling techniques. The proposed method also offers interpretable parameter control and adapts well to varying task objectives.},

The histogram-like feature map does not contain the distributions of the shortest paths within and across graphs, causing inaccurate graph similarities. To this end, we propose a novel graph kernel called the Distributional Shortest-Path (DSP) graph kernel to embrace both types of distribution information. Since the distribution of substructures (e.g., the shortest paths) follows a power law like that of words in natural language, we utilize neural language models to learn each node's distributional shortest-path feature map, encompassing the distributions and dependencies of the shortest paths in each graph. Moreover, we design the Partition Kernel (PK) to capture the dataset-wide distribution information of the shortest paths. PK projects similar (i.e., belonging to the same partition) distributional shortest-path node feature maps to the same point in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Finally, Kernel Mean Embedding (KME) is applied to compute graph feature maps and efficiently construct the DSP graph kernel. Empirical experiments demonstrate that DSP outperforms state-of-the-art graph kernels on most benchmark datasets.},

Traditional models often focus solely on either triple-level or path-level knowledge, overlooking the benefits of integrating both to enhance logic query answering. This oversight leads to suboptimal representation learning and inefficient query reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new Semantic-Aware representation learning model for Query-answering Embeddings (SAQE). Specifically, SAQE employs a joint learning approach that integrates triple-level and path-level knowledge semantics and captures both explicit and implicit contextual nuances within the knowledge graph, yielding more accurate and contextually relevant representations. To efficiently handle the large combinatorial search spaces in FOL reasoning, we propose a novel hierarchical reasoning optimization strategy by a multi-hop tree thus optimizing subqueries rooted at variable nodes in a divide-and-conquer manner. Theoretical analysis confirms that SAQE effectively supports various types of FOL reasoning and enhances generalizations for query answering.

To address these limitations, we formally define the problem of inductive spatial-temporal prediction under continuous distribution shifts and introduce the Contrastive Learning Based Inductive Graph Neural Network (COIN-GNN) as a solution. We develop a novel metric, Relation Importance (RI), to effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships, forming an informative subgraph. Additionally, we construct an informative temporal memory buffer to store and review influential timestamps identified using influence functions. COIN-GNN then generates pseudo-observations for unstable and uninformative entities during these influential timestamps, simulating potential distribution shifts. By applying contrastive learning, the network learns stable and informative representations that can effectively counter distribution shifts without relying on future knowledge. Our extensive experiments on several real-world datasets-from traffic to weather-demonstrate COIN-GNN's superior performance across different domains without requiring future knowledge.},

However, with the advances of recent digital power, such as widely-used high-frequency trading techniques, existing graph-based methods still have shortcomings in effectively learning multi-granularity temporal relations as they cannot effectively learn the patterns in different frequencies, e.g., minute-level, daily, weekly, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-granularity graph augmented learning framework for interrelated financial time series forecasting. We first construct a temporal return relationship graph with multi-granularity financial time series, including weekly, daily, and minute-level, to comprehensively capture the dynamic relations of equities, including both medium-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Then, to further augment the node relations, we devise an attentional graph augment module to improve the graph learning with fundamental data, which are jointly optimized in the prediction layer. We conduct extensive empirical studies on multiple datasets from both the Chinese and U.S. stock markets. The results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across four key financial metrics, including ARR, ASR, CR, and IR, thereby validating its effectiveness and superiority. The model has been applied and empirically tested in commercial-grade trading platforms, further demonstrating its efficiency and robustness in real-world trading environments.},

  abstract     = {Temporal data analysis plays a pivotal role in applications such as weather forecasting, traffic flow management, energy consumption monitoring, and other areas of urban computing. In recent years, temporal data modeling has transitioned from traditional deep learning methods to pretrained models. However, existing approaches often exhibit significant task-specific limitations, requiring bespoke model designs and extensive domain data for training. To address these challenges, this study introduces KPT, a novel foundation model for temporal data analysis in urban computing. By leveraging temporal competitive attention and feature interaction attention mechanisms, KPT can effectively capture global context, integrate cross-variable features precisely, and achieve universal feature learning across diverse time series tasks. Additionally, the knowledge prompt network facilitates the deep fusion of crosslayer features via an intricate interaction mechanism, enabling the model to identify and align shared temporal patterns across different time series data. These patterns then transformed into knowledge prompts, thereby enhancing the universal feature learning capabilities of the pre-trained model. Experimental results demonstrate that KPT excels in four core temporal analysis tasks within urban computing, outperforming taskspecific models. This highlights KPT's ability to generalize across tasks and underscores its potential as a foundation model for multi-task scenarios in urban computing.},

Standard machine learning algorithms typically assume that the input data is balanced, and they often struggle to effectively learn the distribution of minority class data when dealing with imbalanced data. To address this, our study designed an improved Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) model, named MDGAN, for tabular sample synthesis to augment samples and balance the data distribution. MDGAN employs a multi-generator and multi-discriminator structure to capture non-connected subspace manifolds, thereby better fitting the complete data distribution. To enhance the diversity among the multiple generators, an exclusive loss among generators was designed, ensuring that each generator produces data of different modalities. Additionally, a contrastive loss was introduced to ensure that the generated samples better fit the minority class distribution and are separated from the majority class distribution, preventing blurred classification boundaries. Qualitative and quantitative tests were conducted on 25 real datasets, and the experimental results indicate that MDGAN outperforms traditional classical models and current advanced oversampling models.},

To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger text encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MicroLens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems, yet privacy concerns and limited cross-regional data sharing hinder accurate modeling of global traffic patterns. This paper proposes a Federated Graph Neural Network with Equivalent Hypergraph (FGNNEH) framework to address these challenges by preserving privacy and enhancing cross-client collaboration. FGNNEH consists of two key stages. First, local traffic networks are transformed into high-dimensional hypernodes through an integrated process of backbone network extraction, kernel matrix analysis, and multilayer perceptrons. The backbone network extraction simplifies graph structures by isolating critical nodes and edges based on topological centrality, ensuring computational efficiency while retaining key spatial dependencies. Kernel matrix analysis captures complex nonlinear correlations among traffic flow features, including spatial-temporal dependencies and region-specific dynamics, enabling more effective feature representation. The multilayer perceptrons further fuse these features into robust hypernode embeddings that encapsulate both structural and traffic flow characteristics. Second, a global hypergraph construction mechanism is introduced to optimize inter-client collaboration. This mechanism employs an iterative performance feedback loop to dynamically add or remove edges between hypernodes, addressing the issue of lost inter-client connections and enabling effective cross-regional information exchange. Together, these components reconstruct a global traffic model that balances local privacy with holistic accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets, including PeMSD4, METR-LA and Guangzhou, demonstrate that FGNNEH outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.},

In this paper, we make a substantial stride towards supporting frequent object mining by designing SandwichSketch, which draws inspiration from sandwich making and proposes two techniques including the double fidelity enhancement and hierarchical hot locking to guarantee high fidelity on both two tasks. We implement SandwichSketch on three platforms (CPU, Redis, and FPGA) and show that it enhances accuracy by 38.4× and 5× for two tasks on three real-world datasets, respectively.

Second, the single evaluation of knob configurations may bring overestimation or underestimation because of query performance uncertainty. To solve the above problems, we propose a query uncertainty-aware knob classifier, called KnobCF, to enhance knob tuning. Our method has three contributions: (1) We propose uncertainty-aware configuration estimation to improve the tuning process. (2) We design a few-shot uncertainty estimator that requires no extra data collection, ensuring high efficiency in practical tasks. (3) We provide a flexible framework that can be integrated into existing knob tuners and DBMSs without modification.

This paper systematically investigates prevalent challenges encountered by existing TUL models, conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art models, and proposes a structured framework that encompasses three core components: point-level representation learning, trajectory-level representation learning, and user linking.

For the AFM operation, we leverage universal characteristics (UCs) of the data, which are skewed distributions on data relationships. The UCs indicate that the most part of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed on high-document-frequency terms and the most part of a similarity is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. To extract the foregoing specific region on terms and mean-feature values, we construct a mean-inverted index partitioned into three regions by two structural parameters.

Rich multimodal information alleviates inherent challenges in recommendation systems, such as data sparsity and cold start problems. However, multimodal information further introduces challenges in terms of robustness and generalization capability. Regarding robustness, multimodal information magnifies the risks associated with information adjustment and inherent noise, posing severe challenges to the stability of recommendation models. For generalization capability, multimodal recommender systems are more complex and difficult to train, making it harder for models to handle data beyond the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalization capability. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of existing robustness and generalization capability enhancement strategies in the multimodal recommendation field. We propose a sharpness-aware minimization strategy focused on batch data (BSAM), which effectively enhances the robustness and generalization capability of multimodal recommender systems without requiring extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed loss variant strategy (BSAM+), which accelerates convergence and achieves remarkable performance improvement. We provide rigorous theoretical proofs and conduct experiments with nine advanced models on five widely used datasets to validate the superiority of our strategies. Moreover, our strategies can be integrated with existing robust training and data augmentation strategies to achieve further improvement, providing a superior training paradigm for multimodal recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance, which is common in real-world classification tasks, often leads to biased models favoring majority classes. Data oversampling is a widely used strategy to address this issue. However, traditional oversampling methods often generate incorrect or redundant instances when class overlap occurs, increasing decision boundary complexity. To this end, we propose a novel Generative Oversampling approach to addressing Class Imbalance and Overlap (GOIO) in the classification of tabular data. GOIO combines a Metric-Learning-based Variational Autoencoder (MLVAE) and a Conditional Latent Diffusion Model (CLDM) to handle class imbalance and overlap effectively. The MLVAE employs a triplet-center loss to the adverse effects of class overlap by transforming the data distribution into a more separable latent feature space. Following this, the CLDM is trained with class-center feature prompting and classifier-free guidance strategy to capture class-specific latent distributions accurately. Minority class samples are synthesized in the latent space using the CLDM and then reconstructed into the data space via the MLVAE decoder. Comprehensive experiments on 18 real-world and five synthetic datasets demonstrate that GOIO outperforms the state-of-the-art oversampling methods in F1-score, MCC, and Accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed contributions in addressing class imbalance and overlap.},

  abstract     = {Attributed Question Answering (AQA) aims to provide both a trustworthy answer and a reliable attribution report for a given question. Retrieval is a widely adopted approach, including two general paradigms: Retrieval-Then-Read (RTR) and post-hoc retrieval. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers. However, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly changing information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc retrievalbased AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex logic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving the original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic fact decompositionbased Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which decomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic facts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are fine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from a given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form text. Subsequently, ARE leverages a search engine to retrieve evidences related to atomic facts, inputting these evidences into an LLM-based verifier to determine whether the facts require expansion for re-retrieval or editing. Furthermore, the edited facts are backtracked into the original answer, with evidence aggregated based on the relationship between molecular clauses and atomic facts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric Attrp for evaluating the precision of evidence attribution.},

  abstract     = {The storage location assignment problem for export containers (EC-SLAP) is crucial to the efficiency of cargo turnover in ports. Existing methods fall short in real-world applications due to the challenges of the unpredictability of container arrival sequences and the large-scale problem. We propose a new buffer-wise framework based on hierarchical reinforcement learning for EC-SLAP, aimed at optimizing container turnover efficiency. The framework comprises two processes: 1) Ranking Agent ranks containers in the buffer, reducing the uncertainty of random arrival sequences compared to the immediate assignment. 2) Assigning Agents assign storage locations in a two-step process by block and slot, diminishing the dimensionality of the large-scale discrete action space. We iteratively optimize agents by asynchronously obtaining rewards from the environment. In addition, to address the challenge of sparse rewards in long-sequence decision-making, we have developed a novel immediate reward function to enhance learning efficiency and accelerate convergence. We propose a new large-scale dataset, NZP-SLAD, collected from real-world historical data from the terminal operating system of Ningbo-Zhoushan Port and develop a realistic container terminal simulator. We conducted numerous offline simulations and tests with this dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves rapid convergence and significantly surpasses expert methods used in real-world production.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of multimedia fake news on social media has raised significant concerns in recent years. Existing studies on fake news detection predominantly adopt an instance-based paradigm, where the detector evaluates a single post to determine its veracity. Despite notable advancements achieved in this domain, we argue that the instance-based approach is misaligned with real-world deployment scenarios. In practice, detectors typically operate on servers that process incoming posts in temporal order, striving to assess their authenticity promptly. Instance-based detectors lack awareness of temporal information and contextual relationships between surrounding posts, therefore fail to capture long-range dependencies from the timeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce a more practical stream-based multi-modal fake news detection paradigm, which assumes that social media posts arrive continuously over time and allows the utilization of previously seen posts to aid in the classification of incoming ones. To enable effective and transferable fake news detection under this novel paradigm, we propose maintaining historical knowledge as a collection of incremental high-level forgery patterns. Based on this principle, we design a novel framework called Incremental Forgery Pattern Learning and Clues Refinement (IPLCR). IPLCR incrementally learns high-level forgery patterns as the stream evolves, leveraging this knowledge to improve the detection of newly arrived posts. At the core of IPLCR is the Incremental Forgery Pattern Bank (IPB), which dynamically summarizes historical posts into a set of latent forgery patterns. IPB is designed to continuously incorporate timely knowledge and actively discard obsolete information, even during inference. When a new post arrives, IPLCR retrieves the most relevant forgery pattern knowledge from IPB and refines the clues for fake news detection. The refined clues are subsequently incorporated into IPB to enrich its knowledge base. Extensive experiments validate IPLCR's effectiveness as a robust stream-based detector. Moreover, IPLCR addresses several critical issues relevant to industrial applications, including seamless context transfer and efficient model upgrading, making it a practical solution for realworld deployment.},

  abstract     = {Learning graphical causal models from observational data can effectively elucidate the underlying causal mechanism behind the variables. In the context of limited datasets, modelers often incorporate prior knowledge, which is assumed to be correct, as a penalty in single-objective optimization. However, this approach struggles to adapt complex and uncertain priors effectively. This paper introduces UpCM, which tackles the issue from a multi-objective optimization perspective. Instead of focusing exclusively on the DAG as the optimization goal, UpCM methodically evaluate the effect of uncertain priors on specific structures, merging data-driven and knowledge-driven objectives. Utilizing the MOEA/D framework, it achieve a balanced tradeoff between these objectives. Furthermore, since uncertain priors may introduce erroneous constraints, resulting in PDAGs lacking consistent extensions, the minimal non-consistent extension is explored. This extension, which separately incorporates positive and negative constraints, aims to approximate the true causality of the PDAGs. Experimental results demonstrate that UpCM achieves significant structural accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods. It reduces the SHD by 7.94%, 13.23%, and 12.8% relative to PC stable, GES, and MAHC, respectively, when incorporating uncertain priors. In downstream inference tasks, UpCM outperforms domain-expert knowledge graphs, owing to its ability to learn explainable causal relationships that balance data-driven evidence with prior knowledge},

In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-k best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-k Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings.

To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic temporal modeling framework, Temporal Dependency Alignment (TDAlign), that equips existing LTSF methods with TDT learning capabilities. TDAlign introduces two key innovations: 1) a loss function that aligns the change values between adjacent time steps in the predictions with those in the target, ensuring consistency with variation patterns, and 2) an adaptive loss balancing strategy that seamlessly integrates the new loss function with existing LTSF methods without introducing additional learnable parameters. As a plug-and-play framework, TDAlign enhances existing methods with minimal computational overhead, featuring only linear time complexity and constant space complexity relative to the prediction length. Extensive experiments on six strong LTSF baselines across seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TDAlign. On average, TDAlign reduces baseline prediction errors by 1.47% to 9.19% and change value errors by 4.57% to 15.78%, highlighting its substantial performance improvements.},

Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restrict the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems.

  abstract     = {In large-scale service networks, Quality of Service (QoS) data is vital for tasks such as resource provisioning, real-time service recommendation, and user experience optimization; yet effectively predicting QoS often faces two key obstacles: data sparsity and highly imbalanced distributions (where most response times cluster near small values while a minority grow disproportionately large). Existing approaches typically rely on individual object (user/service) features, overlooking the phenomenon that users or services within the same region (physical or virtual) exhibit similar network states. This paper presents a Region-Aware Dual-Latent State Learning (R2SL) framework that tackles these challenges by explicitly modeling regional network latent states. Specifically, we propose to learn physical-region (city-level) and virtual-region (AS-level) latent states from historical QoS records through a joint EM-gradient descent strategy, thereby alleviating data sparsity. Furthermore, to mitigate label imbalance in QoS data, we introduce a Smooth Huber (S-Huber) loss function that appropriately reweights extreme errors, preventing the training process from being dominated by outliers. We also develop a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts module, dynamically routing regional latent features based on each prediction task's context. Experiments on real-world QoS datasets show that R2SL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including the newly introduced FRLN. On throughput tasks, R2SL reduces MAE by an average of 18.8% and RMSE by 12.9%, while on response time tasks, it achieves 26.4% lower MAE and 24.2% lower RMSE. These findings indicate that dual-latent state modeling, combined with a distribution-aware loss, effectively captures complex regional patterns and mitigates long-tail label effects, making R2SL a powerful and scalable framework for large-scale QoS data mining in service networks.},

Qualitative comparisons with established frameworks demonstrate PRIME's broad coverage and conceptual soundness. Quantitative experiments validate its effectiveness, with the fuzzy-based method achieving perfect recall on a phishing-only dataset and consistent performance across multiple years.

The Co-Association matrix (CA matrix) based method is the mainstream ensemble clustering approach that constructs the similarity relationships between sample pairs according the weak clustering partitions to generate the final clustering result. However, the existing methods neglect that the quality of cluster is related to its size, i.e., a cluster with smaller size tends to higher accuracy. Moreover, they also do not consider the valuable dissimilarity information in the base clusterings which can reflect the varying importance of sample pairs that are completely disconnected. To this end, we propose the Similarity and Dissimilarity Guided Co-association matrix (SDGCA) to achieve ensemble clustering. First, we introduce normalized ensemble entropy to estimate the quality of each cluster, and construct a similarity matrix based on this estimation. Then, we employ the random walk to explore high-order proximity of base clusterings to construct a dissimilarity matrix. Finally, the adversarial relationship between the similarity matrix and the dissimilarity matrix is utilized to construct a promoted CA matrix for ensemble clustering. We compared our method with 13 state-of-the-art methods across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrated the superior clustering ability and robustness of the proposed approach.

Addressing these concerns, this paper embarks on an exploratory journey into Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), critically examining their convergence and the potential this synergy holds for demystifying the decision-making processes of AI systems. We employ the concept of Explainable CBR (XCBR) system that leverages CBR to acquire case-based explanations or generate explanations using CBR methodologies to enhance AI decision explainability. Though the literature has few surveys on XCBR, recognizing its potential necessitates a detailed exploration of the principles for developing effective XCBR systems. We present a cycle-aligned perspective that examines how explainability functions can be embedded throughout the classical CBR phases: Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review, we propose a set of six functional goals that reflect key explainability needs. These goals are mapped to six thematic categories, forming the basis of a structured XCBR taxonomy. The discussion extends to the broader challenges and prospects facing the CBR-XAI arena, setting the stage for future research directions. This paper offers design guidance and conceptual grounding for future XCBR research and system development.},

  abstract     = {The quality of features plays an important role in the performance of recommender systems. Recognizing this, feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. We believe that this work opens up new possibilities for feature selection.},

  abstract     = {Despite advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture complex user-item interactions, challenges persist due to data sparsity and noise. To address these, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, particularly recent generative approaches, have gained attention due to their ability to augment graph data without requiring complex view constructions and unstable negative sampling. However, existing generative SSL solutions often focus on structural rather than semantic (refer to collaborative signals in recommendation scenarios) reconstruction, limiting their potential as comprehensive recommender. This paper explores the untapped potential of generative SSL for graph-based recommender systems. We highlight two critical challenges: firstly, designing effective diffusion mechanisms to enhance semantic information and collaborative signals while avoiding optimization biases; and secondly, developing adaptive structural masking mechanisms within graph diffusion to improve overall model performance. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel approach: the Guided Diffusion enhanced Mask graph AutoEncoder (GDiffMAE). GDiffMAE integrates an adaptive mask encoder for structural reconstruction and a guided diffusion model for semantic reconstruction, addressing the limitations of current methods. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that GDiffMAE consistently outperforms powerful baseline models, particularly in handling noisy data scenarios. By enhancing both structural and semantic dimensions through guided diffusion, our model advances the state-of-the-art in graph-based recommender systems.},

However, the existing ID-LDP methods are used for categorical data and cannot be directly applied to numerical data. In this paper, we propose a numerical data collection (NDC) framework with ID-LDP to provide discriminative protection for the data with different inputs. This framework uses a piecewise mechanism to divide the numerical data into several segments and designs two perturbation methods to minimize the mean value of numerical data based on values submitted by users. We first create an NDC-UE method that encodes the raw data into a binary vector. This method sets the uploaded data bit as 1 and the rest as zero and perturbs each bit with a given probability. We further propose an NDC-GRR algorithm to perturb the numerical data with an optimal privacy budget. To reduce the complexity of NDC-GRR, we apply a greedy algorithm-based spanner to shorten the computation time and improve the accuracy. Theoretical analysis proves that our schemes satisfy the definition of ID-LDP. Experimental results based on two real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset show that the proposed schemes have less mean square error compared with the benchmarks.},

Moreover, existing models prioritize explanation objectives during multi-objective explanations, disrupting the intrinsic hierarchical structures and distant relationships within the graphs, further diminishing their effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel multi-objective explanatory framework with hierarchical structure attribution for GNNs, termed HM-Explainer. This framework constructs a multi-objective explanation generation module based on Pareto theory to balance different and potentially conflicting explanatory objectives. Additionally, to embed hierarchical information into explanations, HM-Explainer designs node-level and cluster-level attribution modules to analyze the impact of input data on GNN decisions hierarchically. Furthermore, a self-attention mechanism is integrated into the node-level attribution module to account for the influence of distant neighbors. Ultimately, the efficacy of HM-Explainer is validated across multiple datasets for different GNN models through experimentation.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of Multi-view Subspace Clustering (MSC) in Latent Embedding Space (LES), existing methods aim to capture and leverage critical multi-view information by mapping it into a low-dimensional LES. However, several aspects can be further improved: (i) Fusion Strategy: Existing methods adopt either early fusion or late fusion to integrate multi-view information, limiting the effectiveness of the fusion. (ii) Diversity: Current methods often overlook the inherent diversity in the multi-view data by focusing on a single LES. (iii) Efficiency: LES-based methods exhibit high computational complexity, with cubic time and quadratic space requirements based on the number of samples. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MSC-DOLES (Multi-view Subspace Clustering in Diverse Orthogonal Latent Embedding Spaces), a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges. MSC-DOLES incorporates a two-stage fusion approach that generates and learns from multiple LES to maximize cross-view diversity. Orthogonality constraints on individual LES ensure view-internal diversity, resulting in a set of Diverse Orthogonal Latent Embedding Spaces (DOLES). The DOLES are then fused into a consensus anchor graph using learnable anchors. The final clustering is induced by partitioning the obtained graph without pre-processing. We develop an eight-step optimization algorithm for MSC-DOLES, which exhibits nearly linear time and space complexities relative to the number of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MSC-DOLES over state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite the success of existing MVC methods in many real-world applications, they often overlook the discrepancy of view-specific latent distribution and struggle to ensure the completeness of the multi-view data. To address these challenges and harness the powerful feature extraction capability of deep networks, we propose a novel Contrastive and Dual Adversarial Representation Learning method for Multi-view Clustering, termed as CDARL, to solve multi-view clustering problems with both complete and incomplete multi-view data. Specifically, CDARL employs alternating adversarial and contrastive learning to align the view-specific representations, driving them into the same semantic latent space to minimize the discrepancy in view-specific distributions. In addition, a consensus latent representation is learned by an adaptive fusion block that integrates information from multiple views. The consensus representation is further refined through adversarial learning modeling the transformation of the standard Gaussian distribution to the original data distribution. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates an imputation strategy designed to handle the incomplete multi-view data clustering task. This strategy utilizes both reconstructed samples and cross-view neighbors to impute missing views from the latent space and the original space, thereby preserving clustering information, which ensures the quality and feasibility of the imputed samples. Experimental results on six widely used datasets have verified the competitiveness of the proposed CDARL method against state-of-the-art methods in MVC problems with complete and incomplete multi-view data.

  abstract     = {Recently, many machine learning-based approaches that effectively solve graph optimization problems have been proposed. The graph optimization problem is the problem that aims to optimize (maximize or minimize) a quantity that is associated with a graph, such as the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. These approaches are usually trained on graphs randomly generated with graph generators or sampled from existing datasets. However, we observe that such training graphs lead to poor testing performance if the testing graphs are not generated analogously, i.e., the generalizability of the models trained on those randomly generated training graphs is very limited. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a new framework, named Learning with Iterative Graph Diversification (LIGD), and formulate a new research problem, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem (DGMP), that iteratively generate diversified training graphs and train the models that solve graph optimization problems to improve their performance significantly. We propose three approaches to solve DGMP by considering both the performance of the machine learning approaches and the structural properties of the training graphs. In addition, we study a practical case of DGMP, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem with XOR Diversity (DGMP-XDiv), which considers an XOR-based diversity function. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm named Structure Diversifying Modification on Edge Score (DMES) to obtain the optimal solution. We also propose DMES with Efficiency-Boosting Strategies (DMES-EB) to enhance the efficiency of DMES significantly. Experimental results on well-known problems show that our proposed approaches significantly boost the performance of both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches. They produce near-optimal results and significantly outperform the baseline approaches, such as graph augmentation and diffusion-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {The demand for more precise and timely urban resource allocation and management has driven the extension of urban flow prediction from short-term to long-term horizons. As the time scale expands, the issue of urban flow distribution shift becomes increasingly prominent due to various impact factors, such as weather, events, city changes, etc. Traditionally, comprehensively analyzing and addressing the causal relationships underlying the distribution shift caused by these factors has been challenging. In this paper, we propose that these impact factors can be partitioned in two major types, i.e., context factors and structural factors. We then present a decomposition-based model for long-term urban flow prediction from a causal perspective, named DeCau, which can discriminate between the two types of factors for effectively solving the problem of urban flow distribution shift. First, we employ a decomposition module to decompose urban flow into seasonal part and trend part. The seasonal part contains high frequency irregular variations caused by context factors. We advise a shared distribution estimator to approximate the unavailable prior distributions of context factors, and then apply causal intervention to mitigate the confounding impact of context factors. The distribution shift in the trend part is induced by structural factors. We design a dual causal dependency extractor to model the causality between POIs distribution and urban flow, and then eliminate spurious correlations through causal adjustment. Finally, we design an end-to-end framework for long-term urban flow prediction by combining the embeddings from two parts, enabling the model to generalize to unseen distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate DeCau outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, most existing clustering methods for bipartite graphs enforce the assignment of all vertices to clusters, often neglecting the important roles of outliers and hubs. To address this limitation, we plan to extend the structural clustering model from unipartite to bipartite graphs. This extension is non-trivial due to the lack of common neighbors in bipartite graphs, which renders traditional similarity measures less effective. Recognizing that similarity is key to structural clustering, we resort to butterflies—the fundamental building blocks of bipartite graphs—to define a more effective similarity measure. Building on this, we further propose a novel structural clustering model, SBC, tailored for bipartite graphs. To enable clustering under this model, we develop efficient online and index-based methods, along with a dynamic maintenance method to accommodate graph updates over time. Extensive experiments on real-world bipartite graphs demonstrate that: (1) The SBC model greatly enhances clustering quality, achieving higher modularity while effectively identifying outliers and hubs. (2) Our proposed clustering methods are highly scalable, enabling the processing of graphs with up to 12.2 million edges within 2 seconds},

  abstract     = {Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in table understanding, yet they remain vulnerable to the structural noise (SN) and the textual noise (TN). Existing methods usually employ biased denoising strategies such as structural matching and textual filtering, or overzealous denoising strategies such as introducing supplementary tasks like text-to-SQL and table-to-text to reduce these two types of noise. However, these methods either neglect one type of noise or introduce substantial external noise. Therefore, how to simultaneously mitigate the structural and textual noise without introducing extra noise and improve the performance of LLMs in table understanding is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we rethink the bottlenecks in table understanding from the perspective of noise reduction and propose a novel dual-denoiser-reasoner model, called TabDDR, for balanced and effective denoising. Specially, our model consists of a structural-and-textual denoiser and a task-adaptive reasoner. The former removes two types of noise via triplet alignment and planning extraction to seek an interpretable balance between breaking structural barriers and preserving structural characteristics, eliminating textual noise and retaining maximal information; the latter ensures a simple but effective reasoning process which can adapt to various downstream tasks. To highlight the presence and impact of the structural and textual noise, we construct the WTQ-SN and WTQ-TN datasets based on the WikiTableQuestion (WTQ) dataset. Extensive experiments on these self-constructed datasets and two other public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, special-purpose quantum computing architectures have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, attracting significant attention across various fields. These systems enable researchers to tackle domain-specific optimization problems with reduced computational time. To the best of our knowledge, no applications of quantum computing have been proposed in the field of educational technology. This study therefore aimed to design a quantum QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation for optimizing test sheet composition.

  abstract     = {The rapid digitalization of higher education has positioned the Cognitive Evolution Engine (CEE)-defined as an adaptive AI system that dynamically models learner cognition and evolves through iterative optimization-as an emerging technology for personalized learning in China. This systematic review examines CEE applications through comprehensive analysis of 14,953 documents from IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI (2014-2024), with 94 studies meeting rigorous criteria for detailed content analysis. Our analysis reveals both significant progress and implementation challenges. CEE research has grown exponentially since 2019, particularly following China's 2022 Digital Education initiatives. However, we identified notable gaps between theoretical concepts and practical implementations, with most current systems utilizing established AI technologies rather than fully realized cognitive evolution mechanisms. Geographic distribution analysis indicates that 58% of high-quality research originates from eastern institutions, highlighting regional disparities in research capacity. Additionally, system transparency emerged as a key concern, with a majority of empirical studies acknowledging challenges in algorithmic interpretability. Based on systematic synthesis, we propose a three-dimensional framework integrating technological infrastructure, pedagogical principles, and implementation strategies adapted to Chinese educational contexts. This framework provides guidance for advancing from current AI applications toward authentic CEE systems. Our research contributes the first comprehensive analysis of CEE in Chinese higher education, offering evidence-based insights for enhancing personalized learning while addressing identified implementation challenges.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV), task offloading is crucial for managing tasks that require extensive computing power to guarantee vehicle safety under different weather scenarios. However, extreme weather events can lead to infrastructure damage and network disruptions, significantly increasing the computational demands of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles require additional computing resources to navigate complex road conditions and risks, all while facing a high degree of uncertainty, such as fluctuations in vehicle resource utilization and task workloads. To address these challenges, a new and lightweight task offloading decision framework, named 2FDP-BRL, has been first proposed in this paper. This framework not only considers the fast response time required for autonomous driving, but also considers the resource shortage and offloading uncertainty caused by extreme weather. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic pricing idea and the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) utilizing broad reinforcement learning to deal with various dynamic uncertainties in the IoAV under extreme weather. For the authenticity of experimental results, we utilize the VISSIM platform to collect experimental data and conduct simulations. Moreover, to accurately simulate extreme weather scenarios, we also account for the variability of infrastructure and road elements, including reduced transmission rates and decreased efficiency in executing tasks. Furthermore, to enhance the realism of the simulation, we incorporate historical weather data from NOAA for Shenyang in 2024 to model dynamic uncertainties under extreme weather conditions and conduct comparative experimental analyses focusing on task completion rates. Finally, the proposed framework was implemented on both a local setup and the Huawei Atlas 200I DK A2 device, illustrating its efficacy design.},

Attackers can monitor the user and infer private information such as personality and preferences by stealing the behavioral information. In this paper, we investigated the potential threat of information stealing via the leakage current of laptops and electrodes in wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and bracelets). Specifically, the leakage current in the laptop adapter can flow from the metal casing into the human body and be collected by electrodes in wearable devices when the user is using a laptop with a metal casing (e.g., MacBook). We verified the correlation between leakage current and the working states of the laptop, where different operations corresponding to different CPU instructions can generate different leakage currents. Based on this, we propose LeakThief, a system that consists of three components: leakage current detection, application operation detection, and application recognition. The experiments in a real-world environment demonstrated that the proposed system can recognize 25 common applications with high accuracy, including launching-based (96.4%) and in-application operation-based recognition (81.2%).},

  abstract     = {The increasing processing demands of today's mobile deep learning applications impose stringent requirements on edge devices. Offloading these tasks to the cloud, while being a potential solution, often results in significant data transfer overhead, as well as privacy and connectivity concerns. To address these challenges, split machine learning (split ML) has emerged as an innovative paradigm, enabling task distribution among edge devices themselves. However, split ML systems inherently exhibit instability due to the hardware and communication limitations of mobile devices, which frequently result in failures and malfunctions of client nodes. In light of these challenges, we present Axolotl, a fault-tolerant edge split ML inference system for addressing node failure with minimal performance impact. Specifically, we first design a novel curriculum dropout mechanism to enhance the model's resilience by gradually exposing it to potential server node failures. We then design inverse-proximal weight consolidation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by curriculum dropout. To further tackle potential node failures, we innovate in a resource-aware substitution module that offload the functions of a failed node to neighboring ones, ensuring efficient information flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Axolotl in various deep learning networks and tasks in edge environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates uplink radio resource optimization of a user-centric (UC) cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system aided by the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique subject to pilot contamination. We formulate problem to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) problem by jointly addressing decoding order selection, power allocation, and access point (AP) - user equipment (UE) association assignment. The envisioned optimization exhibits two challenges. First, it requires global channel state information (CSI) for near-optimal performance, which incurs substantial overhead and data collection costs in large-scale CF networks. Second, the optimization is intractable due to its NP-hard and discrete non-linear programming nature. To address the CSI acquisition issue, we utilize a digital twin (DT) of the CF mMIMO system, leveraging its context-awareness to acquire global CSI with reduced overhead. To address computational intractiablity of the optimization problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems. The power allocation sub-problem is transformed into a second-order cone programming problem and solved by the bisection method. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic approach for power allocation. Next, we propose an analytical method for the decoding order selection by ranking the channels in descending order of strength. Simulation results validate the ability of the proposed approach to attain the near-optimal performance. Subsequently, the AP-UE association assignment problem is solved by a heuristic approach to further improve the SE performance. Finally, we solve the original NP-hard problem in a unified manner via the block-coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results underscore a substantial 61% improvement in the SE performance when integrating the RSMA technique into a UC CF mMIMO system.},

Although existing identity-based broadcast signcryption schemes provide secure one-to-many transmission, they typically fail to preserve recipient anonymity. In particular, each recipient is usually required to know the identities of all other recipients to unsigncrypt the message, which undermines privacy and enables inference attacks, especially problematic in telemedicine applications. In this paper, we propose a novel broadcast signcryption scheme that simultaneously achieves recipient anonymity, sender anonymity, and resilience to physical attacks, which are not realized in prior work. Our key innovation lies in an anonymity-preserving unsigncryption mechanism based on inner product, which enables each recipient to independently verify and decrypt the broadcast message without knowledge of others' identities. In addition, we incorporate a physical unclonable function with a fuzzy extractor to resist physical attacks in the presence of noise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security analysis demonstrates that our scheme satisfies essential security properties, including authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and full anonymity. It is resilient against common attacks such as impersonation, modification, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, performance evaluations confirm the practical feasibility of our scheme.},

Despite its success in various domains, current FL frameworks lack mechanisms to accommodate personalized training objectives, particularly in optimizing performance for specific data classes. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) present opportunities to address these limitations by supplementing training data for user-preferred classes using generative models. Nonetheless, incorporating AIGC into FL introduces significant challenges, including non-compliant data quality, disorganized data distributions, limited computational resources, and slow data generation speed on edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose AIGC-enhanced Federated Preference Learning (FPL), a novel framework designed to enhance FL performance for user-specified preference classes (PCs). Our approach employs pre-training and fine-tuning of generative models across diverse datasets to improve the quality of synthetic data. Additionally, we optimize FPL efficiency through a client selection strategy that matches tasks involving generated data with suitable clients and a data distribution mechanism that allocates synthetic data to where it is most needed. To further accelerate data supplementation, data augmentation is utilized on local clients. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for AIGC-enhanced FPL and demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, including ablation studies on various data supplementation techniques.},

Even multi vehicle-assisted reporting schemes are limited by the assumption that all vehicles have the same credibility, which does not reflect the actual dynamic VANET environment in which vehicles have different credibilities. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-assisted VANET message reporting scheme with weighted threshold signatures. Through the design of weights, the credibility of different vehicles is quantified, and the impact of vehicles on the signing process is differentiated. Threshold signature generation relies on the weight sum of all signatories reaching a predetermined threshold, to enable flexible and reliable message reporting. Security analysis shows that our proposed scheme combined with blockchain can satisfy the security and privacy requirements of VANET message reporting.

This paper proposes a strategy named EDGE360, that employs an edge-driven Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) solution for rate adaptation to improve the joint QoE in DASH-based rich media content delivery based on adaptive viewport prediction and Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) corresponding tiling granularity selection.

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of current tracking systems is constrained by several critical limitations: 1) The low-quality sensing signals in complex scenarios lead to increased tracking errors; 2) Existing methods inadequately adjust to dynamic environments, necessitating additional data collection or retraining processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces EOC-Tracking, a device-free Wi-Fi tracking system that dynamically incorporates environmental information. Our key innovation involves leveraging obstacles to correct illogical users' trajectories and facilitate adjustment to varying environments. This significantly improves the accuracy of the follow-up in complex and changing environments. The EOC-Tracking system is built upon three fundamental design principles: 1) A lightweight dual-branch neural network architecture that effectively fuses environmental data with Wi-Fi signal characteristics; 2) An autonomous map updating mechanism that facilitates real-time adaptation to environmental layout modifications without human intervention; 3) A sophisticated data-driven, phased training paradigm that optimizes the model's ability to learn and apply obstacle constraints. We implement EOC-Tracking using commercial Wi-Fi devices and deploy it on low-power embedded systems such as the MCU. Experimental results demonstrate that EOC-Tracking can reduce tracking errors by at most 49.48% compared to datadriven methods and 62.21% compared to model-based methods in various complex scenarios.},

While UAVs offer promising solutions for mobile edge computing, their deployment in high-rise urban areas presents significant challenges, particularly in computational resource balancing, energy-efficient trajectory planning, and dynamic IoT service provisioning. We propose a comprehensive low-altitude UAV-assisted mobile edge computing framework that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning, the assignment of offloaded tasks to specific UAVs, and the strategic deployment and energy management of the UAV fleet to maximize system utility. We first formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and prove its NP-hardness due to its non-convex and integer linear programming nature. To tackle this challenge, we develop a decomposition-based approach that systematically addresses the coupled variables. We then propose a novel Variable Strategy Reinforcement Learning-based Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm that synergistically combines Q-learning, Sarsa, and Monte Carlo methods with the LKH algorithm. The proposed solution is further enhanced by incorporating two refined trajectory optimization mechanisms, the Trajectory Refining Algorithm and the Service-Oriented Segmented Trajectory Refining Algorithm, specifically designed to improve the robustness and reliability in solving the Computation Offloading Trajectory Optimization Problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving faster convergence, higher energy efficiency for UAVs, and lower computational latency for IoT devices.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging computing paradigm, Computing Power Networks (CPNs) are dedicated to coordinating and managing network resources and computing resources to achieve interconnectivity in computing power perception. Efficient collaborative computing of massive data can be achieved through the scheduling function of CPNs. However, existing scheduling research mainly focuses on selecting network links and computing nodes, lacking consideration for task execution after scheduling, which may degrade the Quality of Service (QoS), leading to widespread failures and significant losses. To address this issue, we design a priority-aware preemptive task scheduling (P2TS) strategy for CPNs to jointly optimize task scheduling and execution in terms of success rate, average processing delay, and load balancing. Specifically, at the execution level, we propose a priority-aware preemptive mechanism (P2M) to optimize post-scheduling task execution. Then, at the scheduling level, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the scheduling process supporting the P2M in CPNs. A series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our strategy.},

However, due to the harsh underwater environment and the noncooperativity of targets, improving tracking accuracy remains a challenge, especially for highly-maneuvering targets. To address this problem, based on multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) networks, this paper extends the idea of interacting multiple models (IMM) and designs a bearing-only cooperative tracking algorithm in the consideration of the harsh underwater acoustic channels. Specifically, in position prediction, the combination of historical information and the concept of IMM reduces the severe time-lagged effect in traditional prediction methods and the model reliance in standard IMM filters. Then, during position update, a rigidity-assisted relative position representation is designed based solely on bearing measurements, which alleviates the impact of information loss due to communication interruptions, significantly enhancing the continuity of target tracking. Moreover, the algorithm design also considers various uncertainties that may concurrently occur underwater (e.g., error accumulation and model mismatches), and robust optimization strategies with the principle of maximum entropy are designed to enhance the environmental adaptability. Through various simulations and field experiments, the advantages of the proposed method have been validated.},

Deploying UAV networks effectively in these scenarios poses significant challenges due to the unknown and potentially complex locations of users. In scenarios where users are dispersed in intricate spatial patterns, achieving high coverage and resilient network connectivity among the UAV networks is challenging. The irregular and arbitrary distribution of users can lead to gaps in coverage, as traditional UAV placement optimization approaches are often unable to adapt to such dynamic environments. This complexity necessitates advanced strategies to ensure reliable and continuous network service to users. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach that leverages flocking dynamics and distributed consensus algorithms for dynamic UAV positioning. By enabling a multi-modal UAV operation policy, we develop a framework which enables the network to dynamically respond to complex user locations and establish backhaul connectivity between dispersed user clusters. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach successfully establishes a robust and adaptable UAV network capable of providing seamless coverage for complex user configurations and also ensuring comprehensive inter-cluster connectivity among dispersed user clusters. Additionally, the network exhibits strong resilience against random failures, swiftly recovering from disruptions to ensure stable and reliable communication even when UAVs are compromised.},

However, approaches relying on wearable devices or vision-based systems are often constrained by hardware-intensive, high computational requirements, reliance on line-of-sight, and privacy concerns. Wireless sensing, particularly using Channel State Information (CSI), offers a promising alternative by translating environmental perturbations into CSI variation data. Nevertheless, existing CSI-based systems face significant challenges in domain adaptation, resource limitation, and scalability issues. This paper introduces MaestroBot, a hierarchical motion coordination system that combines distributed CSI-based wireless sensing with domain-adaptive learning to address these limitations. For leader robots, the system features a lightweight hand gesture recognition model, built on a “Hybrid-Single” knowledge distillation framework, achieving up to 95.87% accuracy while maintaining adaptability across diverse domains. For follower robots, the hierarchical motion propagation model leverages localized CSI analysis and dual-layer error correction mechanisms to deliver 97.2% accuracy with a low latency of 0.085 seconds, even in multi-row formations. Additionally, its cost-effective hardware design ensures practical scalability and real-world deployability.

  abstract     = {The vehicular environment presents unique challenges, including massive data generation, stringent latency requirements for safety-critical applications, bandwidth limitations, and intermittent connectivity, which make centralized learning approaches impractical. Vehicular Federated Learning (VFL) enables distributed model training by leveraging local data from connected vehicles, while preserving data privacy and reducing network overhead. However, the dynamic nature of VFL presents several additional challenges. High vehicle mobility and unstable channels lead to inconsistent client participation, while heterogeneous vehicle capabilities result in unbalanced training workloads and competitive resource allocation. These challenges significantly degrade VFL model performance and prolong training periods. In this paper, we propose a Mobility Resilient Vehicular Federated Learning (MR-VFL) scheme, which comprises two key components: an amplification-based adaptive vehicular FL (AVFL) training scheme and a dual-timescale FL scheduler. Specifically, AVFL adapts local training epochs to vehicle capabilities to improve scheduling flexibility and alleviate the impact of insufficient local epochs on model updates, which enhances training efficiency and reduces communication competition. The dual-timescale FL scheduler includes a macro scheduling strategy that optimizes long-term VFL performance based on the correlation between convergence speed and model accuracy, and a Mamba-based real-time scheduler that enhances training efficiency and reduces decision latency in massive vehicles scenarios. Extensive simulations show that MR-VFL effectively mitigates performance degradation due to complex vehicle mobility and heterogeneity, and improves training efficiency.},

To improve algorithmic efficiency and search quality, the prim algorithm is introduced to ensure chromosome feasibility, enhancing both the diversity of the initial population and computational efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves better recovery performance than three comparison methods in all scenarios. The average number of recovered edges improves by up to 18.30% over the second-best method. Under non-recoverable conditions, resilience improves by up to 20.52%.

It exploits out-ear microphones for biometrics extraction, which are ubiquitous on off-the-shelf earphones. We analyze the acoustic response model of ears towards out-ear microphones via the air, which is different from that towards in-ear microphones. A frequency-varying ultrasonic modulation scheme is proposed to characterize in-depth ear biometrics in user-friendly, error-free, and time-efficient ways. Therefore, OnePiece enables quick-pass authentication once users wear the earphones, followed by continuous authentication covering the whole course. Moreover, we propose a wake-up mechanism to reduce the consumed power, which addresses the key power consumption issue in ultrasonic sensing techniques. Particularly, OnePiece can be smoothly deployed on off-the-shelf wired and wireless earphones. It performs good cross-device performance in which users just register only once.

However, resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face dual challenges: limited computational power struggles to meet the high demands of complex cryptographic algorithms, while bandwidth constraints exacerbate communication overhead caused by multi-round interaction mechanisms. Moreover, existing solutions find it hard to support dynamic group environments and are prone to single point of failure (SPoF) in centralized architectures, which significantly compromises system reliability and scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel key agreement protocol for FANET. The protocol employs an improved tree-based key encapsulation mechanism (iTreeKEM) to support rapid key updates in highly dynamic environments. It reduces the computational cost for each group member by 90.08% even when the group size reaches 128. To further enhance system robustness, the protocol introduces a smart contract-based distributed leader election mechanism, effectively eliminating SPoF. The security of the proposed protocol is guaranteed by the CDH problem under the generalized selective decryption (GSD) model. Finally, we implement the protocol in NS-3 simulations, and the results demonstrate its effective applicability to FANET.},

Recently, millimeter-wave radar has been employed for contactless identification, offering advantages such as light insensitivity, privacy preservation, and sensitivity to fine motion. However, its limited wall penetration and vulnerability to occlusion present ongoing challenges. Moreover, existing recognition approaches rely heavily on supervised learning, demanding large labeled datasets and exhibiting poor generalization across domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lip-TWCDID, a lip movement-based cross-domain user identification system using 1–2 GHz MIMO radar. The use of low-frequency signals enhances penetration, while the MIMO architecture improves spatial resolution, enabling stable detection of fine-grained micro-Doppler signatures of lip movements through a 22 cm brick wall. To reduce dependence on labeled data and improve domain generalization, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework, consistency-adversarial-contrastive learning (CACL), which integrates pseudo-label consistency learning, domain adversarial training, and pseudo-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, pseudo-label consistency enforces prediction consistency under input perturbations, improving robustness; domain adversarial training introduces a domain discriminator to encourage domaininvariant feature learning and align feature distributions; pseudosupervised contrastive learning leverages high-confidence pseudolabels to perform contrastive learning in the feature space, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class compactness. By jointly optimizing these components, CACL effectively adapts to unlabeled target domains while minimizing annotation costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CACL outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods and significantly improves the generalization and robustness of through-wall user identification.},

In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware multi-task decentralized federated learning (MMFL) framework for vehicular networks. By this framework, we address task scheduling, subcarrier allocation, and leader selection, as a joint optimization problem, termed TSLP. For the case with a single FL task, we derive the convergence bound of model training. For general cases, we first model TSLP as a resource allocation game, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, based on this proof, we reformulate the game as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and develop an algorithm based on heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) to solve DEC-POMDP.

To address this, we propose a dynamic routing protocol for nanonetworks that integrates real-time velocity vectors to account for time-varying node positions. During relay node selection, key factors such as candidate nodes' velocity vectors are comprehensively evaluated to determine the optimal relay for next-hop transmission. To ensure efficient data exchange among multiple nodes, we design a time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based media access control (MAC) protocol to prevent packet collisions and losses. The protocol assigns distinct transmission and reception time slots to different node types and implements a countdown mechanism to manage channel access and eliminate conflicts.

  abstract     = {The Internet today hosts a multitude of communication sessions from diverse vertical industries, each with distinct and increasingly stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements across multiple performance metrics. However, QoS-aware routing remains a significant challenge in traffic engineering, as existing solutions struggle to adapt to dynamic network conditions and meet these rigorous QoS demands. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-agent graph reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm that provides differentiated treatment for multiple services. First, we explore both nodebased and link-based graph reinforcement learning paradigms for performance comparison. Second, two key mechanisms, i.e., a packet sacrifice mechanism and a Tchebycheff-based reward function, are designed to realize adaptive sacrifice behavior patterns, aiming to optimize the lower bound of service satisfaction rates and enhance fairness across services. Furthermore, to ensure practical applicability, we devise a distributed computing architecture featuring neighborhood-restricted data acquisition and asynchronous historical information retrieval. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform benchmark methods regarding the minimum service satisfaction rate, even under unseen networks. Besides, the distributed computing architecture is proven to incur no performance penalty, which can be generalized to other resource-constrained applications.},

  abstract     = {End-edge collaborative inference improves computational efficiency by dividing a deep neural network into two parts, executed across the end device and the edge node in parallel. However, adversaries like malicious edge nodes can exploit transmitted data to reconstruct original inputs or infer sensitive attributes. Existing collaborative inference strategies upload the majority of input features to the edge node, significantly increasing the risk of privacy leakage, even without input reconstruction. Therefore, we propose PrivGuardInfer, a channel-level DNN end-edge collaborative inference strategy that optimizes intra-layer partition to simultaneously protect original inputs and sensitive attributes while ensuring latency constraints, supported by three key designs. First, the privacy measurements oriented both layer depth and channel count, jointly quantify the difficulty of reconstructing original inputs using varying numbers of feature maps across different layers. After assessing each channel's contribution, the information offset further measures the difficulty of inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, PrivGuardInfer models the privacy-optimal intra-layer partition under latency constraints as a grouped knapsack problem, mapping attack difficulty to item values and inference latency to item weights. Experimental results reveal that PrivGuardInfer achieves an average improvement of 80.54% in defending against model inversion attacks and 63.34% against attribute inference attacks compared to existing end-edge partition strategies. Moreover, it outperforms current privacy protection methods by an average of 69.37% and 49.75% in mitigating these two types of attacks.},

The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations.

Second, unlike natural objects with fixed shapes, each geographic field is distinct and geographic data are environmentsensitive, following complex physical laws. Consequently, learning from data in other fields is difficult. Third, such data may be obtained from manual surveys and crowdsourcing, which often results in weakly-labeled and noisy datasets. We model our field data as (i) manually surveyed labeled data with holes and (ii) crowdsourced weakly-labeled data without holes.

However, due to the system and data heterogeneity of mobile clients (MCs), group-based FL with a sampling mechanism is crucial for minimizing model training costs. To address these challenges, we investigate and formulate the problem of group-based FL with a sampling mechanism for reducing model training cost (i.e., latency and energy consumption), and propose a group-based FL with a cost-efficient sampling mechanism (GFLCSM) framework to address it. More precisely, before training, each MC locally pre-trains a model, estimates its data distribution from the classifier's gradient norms, and uploads it to the central server (CS) instead of raw data to preserve privacy. Using this information, the CS transforms vanilla FL into a group-based FL. During training, GFLCSM replaces the random sampling mechanism with a cost-efficient one. Moreover, to enhance robustness against network dynamics, we extend GFLCSM with a backup resampling mechanism, termed GFLCSM-E. Experimental results indicate that GFLCSM surpasses the baseline frameworks, reducing latency by 24.63% and energy consumption by 11.47% on average across two datasets, while GFLCSM-E maintains high performance even under client dropout.

While integrating millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar point clouds with vision data offers a promising solution, existing methods often suffer from excessive data overhead and degraded accuracy due to redundant and noisy information. To address this limitation, this paper presents VR-PCT, a multi-modal transformer for edge-client collaborative VR semantic recognition that fuses mmWave radar point cloud and vision data for VR applications. VR-PCT introduces a novel collaborative design where VR clients perform lightweight semantic region detection while VR edge processes multi-modal VR semantic recognition. Through efficient edge-client collaboration, VR-PCT optimizes the transmission of mmWave point cloud and vision data by transmitting only the VR semantic region of vision data instead of the entire video. Additionally, it incorporates adaptive cross-modal data selection and fusion strategies to achieve real-time semantic recognition while significantly reducing data redundancy. Across 22 participants engaged in four experimental scenes utilizing VR devices from three different manufacturers, our evaluation demonstrates that VR-PCT achieves 97.6% recognition accuracy while reducing transmission overhead by 81.5% compared to existing approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of VR-PCT in enabling efficient and accurate multi-modal VR semantic recognition for VR applications.

Traditional underwater communication faces limitations like low bandwidth, high latency, and susceptibility to noise, while semantic communication (SC) offers a promising solution by focusing on the exchange of semantics rather than symbols or bits. However, SC encounters challenges in underwater environments, including semantic information mismatch and difficulties in accurately identifying and transmitting critical information that aligns with the diverse requirements of underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SC framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework leverages visual LLMs to perform semantic compression and prioritization of underwater image data according to the query from users. By identifying and encoding key semantic elements within the images, the system selectively transmits high-priority information while applying higher compression rates to less critical regions. On the receiver side, an LLM-based recovery mechanism, along with Global Vision ControlNet and Key Region ControlNet networks, aids in reconstructing the images, thereby enhancing communication efficiency and robustness. Our framework reduces the overall data size to 0.8% of the original. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, ensuring high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction.},

Nevertheless, attaining high PLS for all users in dense networks with multiple malicious terminals is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer encryption (PLE) to complement the PLS in enabling secure wireless transmission. Since such encryption and decryption processes require computation resources, we aim to optimize the encryption decision, offloading decision, as well as wireless and computing resource allocations. Our objective is to minimize the maximum weighted energy consumption while satisfying practical constraints, including limited computing and wireless resources, fulfilling minimum user rate requirements, and complying with IRS conditions. To tackle the non-convex objective and constraints, we explore the utilization of bisection search and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods.

This concern is particularly aggravated when anonymous datasets shared with third-party providers or publicly released can be linked to user data compromised in breaches, leading to severe re-identification attacks and privacy threats. However, comprehensive methods for identifying such privacy risks on a large scale are lacking due to limited networking behavioral data. To address this, we aim to measure the re-identification privacy risk associated with sharing or releasing cellular traces amidst data breaches. Based on the analysis of key privacyimpacting features in traffic usage and base station association data, we propose a novel re-identification method, SURE, which learns similarities between cellular traces to classify if traces belong to the same user. Extensive experiments on a largescale dataset of 10,000 users over four months demonstrate SURE's superior performance, with AUC scores exceeding 0.9.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition code, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper when decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper's reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.

Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model finetuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.},

However, using thermal arrays for Re-ID still faces two major challenges. The first is the low and unclear texture resolution of images caused by low-cost infrared devices. The second is that existing gait recognition methods require maintaining the sequential constraint of gait images, which reduces the flexibility of gait recognition or Re-ID. To address these two challenges, we first designed an edge module inspired by Taylor Finite Difference (TFD) to aggregate image edge information to help improve the resolution of infrared devices. Then, we considered gait as a collection of gait profiles and extracted features from the frame level and collection level for recognition, breaking through the limitations of the number and order of input images. After extensive experimental evaluation, our model can achieve an average recognition accuracy of 87.3% in various scenarios, demonstrating the potential of WarmGait in Re-ID.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs), with advanced content creation and inference capabilities, can provide immersive intelligent services to users in mobile edge networks. However, the increasing demand for real-time artificial intelligence (AI) applications aggravates the limitations of cloud-based LLMs due to the long response time. Meanwhile, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are cost-effective and locally deployable for terminal devices, can serve as an efficient supplement to LLMs for performing latency-sensitive tasks with lower generalization capability. Due to the resource constraints of edge networks and the diverse requirements of user tasks, it is critical to design an inference framework that effectively coordinates the deployment and collaboration of LLMs and SLMs. In this paper, we propose an LLM-SLM collaborative inference (LSCI) scheme under a mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture, which jointly decides where to cache models and how to offload inference tasks to balance latency, accuracy, and resource costs. To optimize inference performance subject to resource constraints, we jointly solve the inference task offloading and model caching problem in LSCI scheme. Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select highly popular SLMs to be cached on the edge server, and distributed belief propagation technique to solve the associated inference task offloading issue. Numerical results show that the proposed LSCI scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of inference performance when compared with a number of baseline solutions.},

In this study, we focus on enhancing learning performance in an industrial assembly line scenario where multiple distributed sensors sequentially collect real-time data with distinct feature spaces. However, existing research lacks an online distributed learning framework tailored for such IIoT settings. To address this gap, we propose the Denoising and Adaptive Online Vertical Federated Learning (DAO-VFL) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the computing potential of edge sensors while addressing key challenges such as communication overhead and data privacy. DAO-VFL effectively manages continuous data streams and adapts to shifting learning objectives. Furthermore, it can address critical challenges prevalent in industrial environment, such as communication noise and heterogeneity of sensor capabilities. To support the proposed algorithm, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, highlighting the effects of noise reduction and adaptive local iteration decisions on the regret bound.

This framework utilizes multiple layers, including ground users, UAVs, HAPs, and satellites, to improve service quality and immersive experiences, particularly in scenarios like Metaverse applications. Ground users request resources, while UAVs and HAPs serve as resource providers, and satellites ensure reliable communication during emergencies. A double auction-based incentive scheme is employed in which operators control UAV and HAP resources to maximize utility, and users aim to minimize computation costs and protect data privacy. To handle the complexity of the operator-user interaction, which results in an NP-hard optimization problem, we applied a hierarchical multi-agent federated deep reinforcement learning (FeDRL) approach. Our simulation results demonstrate that the FeDRL algorithm significantly improves social welfare by 6.38%, 17.43%, and 28.73% over modified MADDPG, FRL, and DDPG algorithms, respectively.},

Federated fine-tuning can leverage distributed data sources and computation power, but it also suffers from system and statistical heterogeneity. Client selection is an effective tool to solve the system and statistical heterogeneity in FL, but existing client selection schemes that involve online measurement will not be as effective in LLM fine-tuning as in conventional FL due to the huge LLM size and fewer fine-tuning rounds. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both system and statistical heterogeneity in federated LLM fine-tuning, and we formulate a new latency minimization problem. We propose to measure client data overlap via knowledge graph offline to assist client selection in federated LLM fine-tuning. Our client selection scheme excels in both model accuracy and fine-tuning latency. We evaluate our scheme via two LLMs and two applications via four datasets. The experiment results illustrate that our scheme achieves the highest accuracy while 2.05x faster than the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Currently, a major issue of WiFi-based sensing technologies is how to adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. The extreme sensitivity of Channel State Information (CSI) makes many WiFi sensing arts frustrated when applied to the complex and unknown real world. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose freeEnv designed to automatically identify the micro-environmental changes (even tiny movements of the laptop) using WiFi devices, which can coexist with other WiFi sensing tasks with zero effort. To achieve automatic identification of micro-environmental changes, we quantify micro-environmental changes based on the physical propagation laws of WiFi signals and the main factors that affect CSI measurements. Then, we design a micro-environmental changes identification method, which determines whether the environment has changed by calculating the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of continuous CSI, without requiring training data. To remove the influence of dynamic human behaviors, we design a human dynamic detection scheme, which is achieved by obtaining the average inter-cluster distance of performing Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on CSI. We evaluate freeEnv in real-world scenarios with six different hardware, four different scenarios, and twenty-four ways of micro-environmental changes. The results show that our method is robust to different devices and scenarios, and can achieve the average precision of 96.1% and 93.2% for micro-environmental changes identification and human dynamic behavior detection. By testing on a case study of threshold-based human presence detection, freeEnv can effectively improve the detection performance.},

However, existing approaches primarily capture spatio-temporal (ST) dependencies from traffic graphs and train their models using randomly ordered data. This overlooks the fact that the modeling difficulty of each sensor/node in the ST traffic graph can vary significantly due to its spatial dependencies and temporal trends, resulting in unreliable and unstable predictions in IoT scenarios. In this context, we argue that a well-designed curriculum with an easy-to-difficult order can improve the training of ST models. Therefore, this paper introduces an ST difficulty measurer to score the node-level difficulty of traffic graph from both spatial and temporal aspects, and then implements a curriculum in the ST model training process. More specifically, based on the tiered ST difficulty score, the ST model training begins with a subgraph consisting of “easy” nodes characterized by relatively consistent spatial relationships and regular temporal patterns. Gradually, more difficult nodes are incorporated into the subgraph and participate in subsequent training stages. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on two real-world traffic flow datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

We focus on Wi-Fi and NR-U coexistence in shared bands and solve the aforementioned problem with a deterministic backoff approach. The proposed scheme allows active transmitters to learn the number of nearby interferers in a distributed manner and, as a result, implement an ordered round-robin transmission schedule to minimize collisions. We show analytically that the scheme converges not only in equilibrium (when collisions are negligible), but also in a general case (when collisions are frequent at the beginning or in the middle of the proposed scheme's operation). Furthermore, extensive simulations prove that the proposed scheme guarantees fairness between contenting cells and technologies (both in terms of throughput and delay) as well as optimizes channel efficiency. We also study the impact of imperfect readings of the number of contending nodes (which may be the result of, e.g., asymmetric channel conditions) on the performance of the proposed scheme. In most cases, the deterministic backoff approach outperforms legacy channel access schemes. Additionally, our proposal does not add additional signaling overhead and is backward compatible with standard Wi-Fi and NR-U operation.},

While deep learning approaches show promise, existing models face three critical limitations: (1) inadequate modeling of long-range feature dependencies, (2) difficulty in correcting time-of-flight (ToF) offsets induced by device clock asynchrony, and (3) prohibitive computational costs for environmental adaptation through model retraining. This paper introduces SwinULoc, a novel U-shaped indoor positioning framework that synergizes Swin Transformer blocks with 2D CSI heatmap processing. Our architecture uniquely addresses these challenges through three key innovations: First, the integration of shifted window attention mechanisms enables effective learning of long-range signal correlations. Second, a multi-access-point fusion strategy enhanced with skip connections achieves precise ToF offset correction through cross-device pattern analysis and multi-scale feature integration. Third, a transfer learning paradigm reduces retraining costs by 75% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive evaluations demonstrate SwinULoc's superiority, achieving 70% higher positioning accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1/4 of the training resources for new environments.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in wireless technology have spurred the growth of indoor localization applications based on wireless signals. Most existing methods model the relationship between input data and the target's location using the $l_{2}$ loss function, which assumes that the residual between the predicted location and the ground truth follows a Gaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation. Nevertheless, this approach may not conform to the actual distribution and lacks confidence measures for individual predictions, potentially compromising accuracy. Furthermore, in the realm of regression, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) remains relatively unexplored due to the absence of a reliable method to quantify prediction uncertainty, especially when labeled data is scarce. To address these challenges, we developed a novel indoor localization algorithm that employs probabilistic distribution modeling. Our approach focuses on indoor localization with Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as the input. Crucially, it leverages Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to model the localization error as a Gaussian distribution, and utilizes Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE) to capture arbitrary error distributions. This enables us to extract the confidence of each prediction and utilize the most reliable ones as pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. By employing probabilistic distribution modeling, we observed a significant improvement in localization accuracy over the $l_{2}$ loss function. Additionally, by integrating pseudo-labeled data for model retraining, our algorithm achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art machine learning-based and SSL-based methods.

Many existing solutions leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task scheduling, yet they often rely on global scheduling approaches.

Additionally, the cold start problem impedes the generation of optimal scheduling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose AEDS, a DRL-based task scheduling framework designed to enhance scheduling efficiency. AEDS optimizes the decision-making process from three aspects: (1) Decision Space Reduction. AEDS incorporates a novel affinity matching mechanism that identifies the most suitable edge cluster based on task characteristics, thereby significantly narrowing the decision search space. (2) Decision Process Optimization. AEDS adopts a hybrid strategy combining offline pre-training and online fine-tuning to address the cold start problem. Offline pre-training with historical task data ensures effective initial scheduling, while online fine-tuning periodically updates the DRL model to enhance long-term adaptability to dynamic system changes. (3) Decision Strategy Calibration. AEDS proposes a task migration solution to adapt to real-time workload variations dynamically. It utilizes triple queues to assess server overload and dynamically calibrates the scheduling strategy through task migration within interconnected clusters. Comprehensive experimental results validate the efficacy of AEDS. Compared with existing frameworks, AEDS reduces task latency by $28.23\%$ and enhances task completion rate by $10.28\%$.

The extended range is primarily attributed to the Chirp Spread Spectrum technique. However, the LoRa physical layer (LoRa PHY) contributes only marginally to this advantage, as it employs an inefficient Forward Error Correction (FEC) strategy for error recovery. In this paper, we introduce Sym-FEC, a symbol-level FEC decoder designed to link the received signals' spectrum with the coding correlations inherent in LoRa PHY, thereby enhancing error recovery. The key enabler of Sym-FEC is signal copy retrieval. We begin by facilitating signal copy conversion between two symbols and extend this to the general case, where signal copy conversions can be performed between any symbols in a coding block. Approaches are also introduced to assess the validity of the block-wide decoding results. Extensive hardware evaluations demonstrate that Sym-FEC provides Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) improvement of 2.3dB to 3dB compared to the traditional decoder in LoRa PHY. Sym-FEC requires no modifications at the transmitter while incurs low storage and computational complexity at the gateway, thus can be easily integrated into gateway nodes.},

  abstract     = {As a complementary solution for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can temporarily provide reliable and flexible offloading services when edge servers are damaged or unavailable. However, existing UAV-assisted MEC systems suffer from issues such as uneven resource allocation, low utilization efficiency, load imbalance, and poor dynamic adaptability, affecting service quality. Moreover, sensitive user equipment (UE) information faces leakage during the computational process of UAVs. How to jointly optimize the scheduling of servers and UAVs for task offloading and resource allocation without compromising UEs' privacy remains a significant challenge. Thus, this paper proposed a privacy-preserving auction framework (namely Prizty) by considering the trajectory of UAVs, their constrained energy and computational capabilities, and the variability in UE distribution. Prizty employs a combinatorial obfuscation method to protect UEs' privacy and links bidding prices to computational resources and energy characteristics. It calls the sub-algorithm WPA to determine the winners by balancing social costs and utility. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Prizty satisfies truthfulness and individual rationality while maintaining scalability for large-scale resource allocation problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate Prizty's effectiveness in critical metrics, including offload rate, average service latency, energy consumption, and social cost.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the role of channel access schemes in enhancing the timeliness of status updates in sensor networks. Specifically, we model the large-scale sensor network as a Poisson cellular network and derive the network average age of information (AoI) under five different channel access schemes: slotted ALOHA, frame slotted ALOHA, random scheduling, round robin, and channel-aware. These schemes are categorized based on random vs. scheduled access and non-channel-aware vs. channel-aware. Our goal is to investigate when the additional overhead and complexity introduced by scheduling and channel state information (CSI) are beneficial, enabling better decisions in network design. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of these schemes is influenced by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) decoding threshold, which often reflects the length of communication data. For short-packet communications, the performance differences among various channel access strategies are minimal, and the gains from scheduling are limited. Additionally, the inclusion of extra CSI does not yield performance improvements; in fact, some simple scheduling strategies, along with channelaware strategy that leverage CSI, may not outperform basic random access methods. Among the protocols we examined, the round robin scheme achieves the best performance. In contrast, scheduled access schemes exhibit a clear performance advantage in long-packet communications. Furthermore, the channel-aware scheme significantly enhances the network AoI performance, particularly in networks with higher transmitter competition.},

  abstract     = {The next generation of industrial Internet-of-Things systems demands timely delivery of fresh data, quantified by the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, from a vast number of sensors. In such systems, sensors usually adopt random access where the back-off mechanism is mostly crucial. This paper studies the back-off mechanism for Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) systems in collision-prone scenarios. Considering the fact that transmitting immediately after a prior successful transmission yields limited AoI reduction, we propose an enhanced waiting CSMA scheme by introducing a waiting window to the existing contention window. In the proposed scheme, each source waits after each successful transmission. It enables a collaborative channel access strategy, such that sources have recently transmitted grant greater opportunities for others to access the channel. To optimize the window sizes, we analyze the Normalized Average Peak AoI (NPAoI) and Normalized Average AoI (NAoI), which are normalized by the packet transmission duration. Our findings indicate that minimizing these metrics is feasible through maintaining a nearly constant collision probability. Specifically, NPAoI reaches its minimum by adjusting either the contention or the waiting window, while NAoI requires a larger waiting window combined with a smaller contention window. Given the network scale, we derive optimal window sizes in closed form. When the network scale is unknown or dynamic, we propose a data-driven approach to adjust window sizes based solely on the real-time measured collision probability. Simulation results confirm that the proposed waiting CSMA scheme significantly outperforms existing methods for both NPAoI and NAoI, particularly in large-scale networks.},

This paper focuses on asynchronous traffic shaping (ATS) in TSN and proposes a novel solution to prioritize the flows being transmitted in a TSN with multiple ATS instances to meet their delay requirements. To this end, we formally formulate the flow prioritization assignment problem in an ATS-TSN network, demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm, and study the solution's scalability. The results show that our solution is optimal, obtaining a shorter execution time than an exhaustive search with the same prioritization result. Furthermore, our solution scales correctly as a function of the number of flows with a considerably low execution time. Compared to another ATS prioritization method, our solution finds feasible solutions four orders of magnitude larger with reduced execution time. Moreover, the results show that per-flow prioritization has higher utilization than per-Priority Code Point (PCP) prioritization. Finally, an increase in the percentage of traffic with strict delay requirements harms the maximum achievable utilization.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) places computational resources at the network edge, thereby enabling compute-intensive applications through task offloading. However, in dynamic multi-user, multi-server environments, user mobility induces time-varying channel conditions, and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of server loads further complicates system behavior. Consequently, the system must jointly optimize discrete offloading decisions and continuous resource-allocation parameters, forming a hybrid action space whose integrated decision-making mechanism is central to breaking the long-standing trade-off between latency and energy consumption. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches that rely on a single policy network often suffer from strong strategy coupling and Q-value estimation bias, leading to policy oscillations and the curse of dimensionality in highly dynamic scenarios and thus impeding stable convergence. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative End-to-End Hybrid Computation Offloading (E2EHCO) framework based on an enhanced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. By employing dual critic networks together with a delayed-update mechanism, the method effectively suppresses Q-value overestimation, while the integration of Softmax and Tanh activations in the actor network allows simultaneous handling of discrete and continuous actions, thereby achieving efficient and robust joint decision optimization under dynamically changing conditions. Experiments on real-world mobility traces show that, relative to benchmark methods, E2EHCO reduces total latency by at least 20% and energy consumption by approximately 16% in high-density user scenarios, providing an adaptive offloading solution with real-time responsiveness for large-scale, dynamic MEC systems.},

This practical issue has been largely overlooked by existing works but becomes increasingly prominent as LoRaWAN scales up. To address this issue, we introduce Canas, an innovative gateway design that is poised to orthogonalize the logical channels by eliminating mutual interference. To this end, Canas develops a series of novel solutions to accurately extract the meta-information of individual ultra-weak LoRa signals from the received overlapping channels. The meta-information is then leveraged to accurately reconstruct and subtract the LoRa signals over thousands of logical channels iteratively. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that Canas can enhance concurrent transmissions across overlapping logical channels by 2.3× compared to the best known related works.},

Given the conflicts between limited communication resources and communication needs, learning effective communication strategies is essential. We observe that incorporating learning to communicate can complicate mastering primary tasks, like vehicle control, the original focus in autonomous driving. This is due to the uncertainty in information acquisition during the learning process, which can lead to an unstable environment for primary tasks. In this paper, we introduce ReSCOM, an efficient joint learning framework that combines learning-to-communicate with primary tasks. ReSCOM progressively adjusts the learning emphasis through rewardshaped curriculum, allowing agents to shift their focus from primary tasks and basic communication tasks (e.g., how to encode) to advanced communication strategies (e.g., determining when it is worthwhile to communicate). This approach minimizes the impact on the learning efficiency of primary tasks while simultaneously facilitating communication learning. Besides, we explore the extent to which communication channel states (i.e., delays and packet loss) and protocols impact agent cooperation and learning. We evaluate ReSCOM against state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, demonstrating its strong performance. Furthermore, we verify that current modern wireless channels, includingWi-Fi, 4G, and 5G, provide low enough delays that their impact can be ignored. When packet loss occurs, we find that the UDP protocol performs better than TCP because, for agent cooperation, timely information is more valuable than reliability.},

Here, a novel multi-level blockchain-secured SDN-based IoT enabled e-voting system has been proposed. The proposed system consists of booth, district, state, and country level systems.

Man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS/DDoS, unauthorized access, and impersonation attacks are avoided using flow rules in SDN controllers and firewalls installed in the servers. Furthermore, blockchain technology provides security for voting data stored at all levels. The security strengths were tested at different levels (e.g., programming, operating system, and network level) using open-source tools (i.e. scyther, nmap, metasploit, etc.). The performance of the proposed architecture was evaluated satisfactorily in a testbed. It also performed satisfactorily under both normal and stressed conditions in a scaled-up environment.},

However, the problem of low accuracy and slow convergence due to inconsistent updates from stragglers and normal clients remains severe in AFL. Previous works either discard or penalize the updates from stragglers, which can lead to the loss of valuable data or introduce bias into the model. Furthermore, existing AFL frameworks integrating synchronous optimization algorithms face the challenges of weak compatibility and scalability, limiting large-scale training. In this paper, we propose DVAFL1 an efficient and scalable AFL framework that significantly improves the performance of AFL in terms of model accuracy and convergence speed by effectively utilizing and compensating for the updates from stragglers, while naturally integrating synchronous optimization algorithms. Specifically, DVAFL introduces a dynamic window protocol for adaptive aggregation to balance the contribution of stragglers and ensure faster and more stable convergence. Further, the version control mechanism corrects stale gradients by compensating for the missed model updates of stragglers, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that DVAFL achieves an average convergence speed 2.3× faster and an accuracy improvement of 5.5% compared to state-of-the-art AFL methods.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoquasistatic (MQS) field positioning has demonstrated significant potential for emergency rescue applications due to its strong penetration and non-reliance on pre-deployment. However, its accuracy is notably impaired by metal interference and distance attenuation. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) can reliably provide motion data even in environments affected by metal and electromagnetic interference, but they suffer from cumulative drift over time. Effectively, combining MQS field and IMU positioning to harness their respective advantages presents a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose a Multi-Layer Position-Pose Fusion (MP2F) framework that integrates MQS field with IMU data to enhance position and pose estimation. The MP2F framework comprises three layers: a Quaternion-based Pose Fusion Layer (QPFL), a Kalman Filter-based Position Fusion Layer (KFFL), and a Global Position-Pose Fusion Layer (GP2FL). Specifically, QPFL utilizes the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to effectively mitigate magnetic field distortion and IMU drift, thereby significantly enhancing pose estimation precision. Next, KFFL incorporates the fused pose estimation from QPFL into an inertial navigation motion model, and leverages MQS field observations to further improve positional accuracy. Finally, GP2FL formulates a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by marginalizing prior factors, inertial sensor factors, and Kalman fusion outputs, enabling globally optimized state estimation. Comprehensive simulation results and analyses prove that the proposed MP2F framework achieves high-precision position and pose estimation in complex emergency scenarios, with strong robustness. Experimental results in real-world environments show that the proposed MP2F achieves improvements in positioning accuracy of 61.1%, 58.7%, 48.4%, and 50.2% over EKF, iMag+, GWO-PF, and MagLoc, respectively.},

To this end, we investigate a new problem of Bilateral Preference-aware Dynamic Task Assignment (BDTA), which is proven to be NP-hard, to maximize overall satisfaction by incorporating worker-task bilateral preferences and assigns tasks using the trajectories of workers. For the BDTA problem, we first propose a hybrid batch processing framework to address uneven data distribution. After that, a task-initiated bidirectional select algorithm is proposed to mitigates the impact of task order on the matching results. Furthermore, we propose an $\alpha$-approximate task-initiated generalized deferred-acceptance algorithm and a reverse generalized deferred-acceptance algorithm to enhance the stability and overall satisfaction of task assignment results.

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of RFID-enabled applications, large-scale RFID systems often require multiple readers to ensure full coverage of numerous tags. In such systems, we sometimes pay more attention to a subset of tags instead of all, which are called key tags. This paper studies an under-investigated problem key tag distribution identification, which aims to identify which key tags are beneath which readers. This is crucial for efficiently managing specific items of interest, which can quickly pinpoint key tags and help RFID readers covering these tags collaborate to improve the tag inventory efficiency. We propose a protocol called Kadept that identifies the key tag distribution by designing a sophisticated Cuckoo filter that teases out key tags as well as assigns each of them a singleton slot for response. With this design, a great number of trivial (non-key) tags will keep silent and free up bandwidth resources for key tags, and each key tag is sorted in a collision-free way and can be identified with only 1-bit response, which significantly improves the time efficiency. To enhance the scalability and efficiency of Kadept for high key tag proportions, we propose E-Kadept protocol, which accelerates the identification process by designing an incremental Cuckoo filter that reduces false positives and improves space efficiency. We theoretically analyze how to optimize protocol parameters of Kadept and E-Kadept, and conduct extensive simulations under different tag distribution scenarios.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is expected to play an important role in many applications, including emergency services, remote surveillance and even daily logistics, thanks to its great advantages such as flexible deployment and mobility support. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV-aided communication scheme supported by laser power transfer (LPT), where the quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of user equipment (UE) is considered. Specifically, to improve the sum QoE, we first maximize the sum of average data rates (ADRs) of all UEs through an alternating optimization of UAVs' positions, UE-network association and LPT station (LPTS)-network association. Then, we devise an advanced Gale-Shapley rematching (GSRM) scheme to address the intractable 0-1 programming problem in UE/LPTS-network association. Moreover, an L2-norm polynomial (L2NP) programming method is designed to transform the L2NP of the LPT-based UAV positioning problem into a convex form. Finally, a redundant resource reallocation (RRR) algorithm is designed to recycle and reallocate the excessive transmit power and backhaul capacity of both the base station (BS) and the UAVs, to further maximize the number of UEs satisfying the QoE requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed UAV-aided communication scheme can help more UEs achieve their QoE requirements at a reduced power consumption compared with existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {In the upcoming global-coverage 6G networks, high packet loss and long latency in long-distance transmissions exacerbate the trade-off between data timeliness and integrity, particularly in time-sensitive applications involving time-series data with stringent integrity requirements. This challenge exposes the limitations of existing transmission systems, such as source-channel coding and semantic communication, which fail to jointly address both dimensions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled generalized deduplication (GD)-based semantic transmission (DLGD-ST) mechanism for time-series data. By leveraging GD to address the impact of semantic ambiguity on data integrity, DLGD-ST exploits the semantic recovery and temporal discreteness of the data to effectively mitigate the conflict between integrity and timeliness. In particular, a well-designed long-short-term memory (LSTM)-based GD algorithm is developed to separate shallow semantic components and supplementary components, ensuring the integrity of semantic transmission. A deep semantic encoding process is then performed using a double-layer progressive dimension reduction (DPDR) and adaptive quantization (AQ) scheme, which capitalizes on the channel robustness of semantics to reduce transmission rounds and improve timeliness. Furthermore, an incremental dimension hybrid automatic repeat request (ID-HARQ) mechanism is introduced to improve semantic reliability by retransmitting high-dimensional semantics, thereby further minimizing end-to-end transmission rounds. To accurately evaluate performance, we introduce the Age of Semantic Information (AoSI), which incorporates integrity constraints into the generalized Age of Information (AoI) to jointly assess integrity and timeliness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DLGD-ST mechanism, enabled by accurate data recovery and reduced transmission rounds, achieves better AoSI performance compared to existing communication systems under both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.},

  abstract     = {The two-factor authentication (2FA) has been widely applied with the proliferation of mobile devices. Currently, many existing 2FA solutions propose to use acoustic fingerprints as the second factor. However, these schemes mainly consider using the magnitude or non-linearity information of the acoustic signal for authentication and ignore the fingerprint variations caused by the change of transmission distance between devices, which could threaten the accuracy of the system. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose Phase-Proof, a secure and robust 2FA that utilizes the phase distortions incurred by the acoustic elements of mobile devices as the second proof. Given the received acoustic signal, our system first extracts phase information from the signal and designs a new distance effect elimination scheme to remove the impact of transmission distances for robust fingerprint extraction. Moreover, our device authentication component then adopts a transfer learning-based method to capture the subtle differences in devices' fingerprints for accurate device authentication. Moreover, to further withstand the co-located attacks, our proximity detection component collects certain environmental randomness from the enrolled phone, and then matches it with the environmental randomness collected from the login device to verify the proximity of two devices. Our experimental results show that our system is accurate in providing 2FA and robust to various attacks across different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of cloud applications has led to unprecedented increases in network traffic volume, diversity, and complexity. As Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) adopt decentralized, geographically distributed data centers, effective traffic management across these environments has become critical. Distributed Rate Limiting (DRL) has emerged as an essential tool to manage the complex traffic dynamics of decentralized networks, yet traditional centralized rate limiting methods fall short, facing limitations in scalability, adaptability to bursty traffic, and efficiency. This paper presents C3PDAR (Cloud Control with Constant Probabilities and Dynamic Adjustment Range), a novel DRL algorithm tailored for decentralized cloud infrastructures. C3PDAR introduces three key innovations: (1) CPS-BPS DualPoint Rate Limiting and Parent-Child Token Bucket mechanisms, which effectively mitigate burst traffic and short-lived connections while improving bandwidth fairness and inter-tenant isolation; (2) A vSwitch-CGW Cascade Rate Limiting architecture, which reduces CPU overhead in CGW clusters and accelerates convergence by 42%–78%; (3) Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) Padding scheme, which embeds rate-limiting information in existing traffic instead of transmitting new data packets, reducing the communication overhead of the C3PDAR algorithm by over 40%. By integrating these advancements, C3PDAR delivers a scalable, robust solution that outperforms traditional DRL approaches in performance, fault tolerance, and resource efficiency. C3PDAR uniquely empowers CSPs to manage complex, high-volume traffic dynamics in decentralized cloud environments, offering both theoretical insights and practical optimizations for next-generation network control.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based energy trading (BBET) systems depend on prosumers to allocate energy between trading activities and blockchain mining operations. However, inadequate incentive structures lead prosumers to under-contribute to mining, creating throughput bottlenecks and system performance degradation. This paper introduces the Fee and Two-Piece Compensation (FTPC) mechanism to optimize energy allocation and enhance system throughput. We formulate the interaction between the system designer and prosumers as a three-stage Stackelberg game where the system designer establishes the incentive framework in Stage I, while prosumers determine energy allocation in Stage II and set transaction fees in Stage III. Our analysis demonstrates that prosumers' failure to internalize mining's positive externality results in suboptimal throughput investment. Counterintuitively, we show that impatient prosumers may exploit others' mining contributions as free riders. The FTPC mechanism resolves these issues by jointly optimizing transaction fees and compensation structures to align individual incentives with social welfare. We prove that FTPC achieves socially optimal outcomes through fully decentralized decision-making. Numerical evaluation shows FTPC improves social welfare and prosumer payoffs by 88.1% and 87.8%, respectively.

To date, in multi-user environments, most DSSE schemes cannot achieve simultaneous access control for both keyword retrieval and data updates. To address this issue, we propose a new DSSE scheme with efficient and complete (keyword retrieval and update) access control for multi-user environments, named EFCAM. Our work has simultaneously achieved efficient, flexible, and fine-grained access control for keyword retrieval and updating, this is extremely rare in existing research. For update operations, we combine file index encoding and homomorphic encryption (HE) technology, so that EFCAM optimizes the calculation; to achieve flexible access control, we adopt an equality test scheme that can supports three types of update authorization. For retrieval operations, users do not need to share keys. By executing a single query, the users can effectively retrieve all the data that they have permission to access. To enhance system security and operational efficiency, we have extended EFCAM with a dynamic policy update mechanism for flexible and real-time adjustment of access control policies. We formally analyze the security of EFCAM to prove that our scheme has forward security (FS) and backward security (BS). Experimental results show that, EFCAM maintains outstanding efficiency in encrypted data retrieval and update operations within multi-user environments, while also exhibiting strong scalability.},

Conventional algorithms, whether rule-based or learning-based, are obsessed with achieving tight coupling between encoding and sending bitrate adaptations for low-latency guarantee. However, our measurement studies reveal alarming harms of tight coupling in suppressing throughput, encoding bitrates and smoothness, as application- and transport-layer bitrate adaptations inherently have different mechanisms and goals. To tackle this problem, we propose Octopus, the first loosely coupled cross-layer bitrate adaptation algorithm for IVS to maximize QoE. Instead of blind synchronization, Octopus promotes mutual cooperation and independence between encoding and sending bitrate adaptations by integrating a multi-head network with shortcut connections and auto-regressive action modules. Additionally, based on meta-imitation reinforcement learning, we design a network condition-aware online adaptation scheme that enables the loosely coupled policy to swiftly adapt to diverse and dynamic wireless networks. We implement Octopus on a testbed, a microcosm of real-world deployment, with transceiver pairs running WebRTC on the WeChat for Business dataset. Results show that Octopus outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, either improving bitrates by 37.1%, or optimizing stalling rate and smoothness by 54.1% and 9.2%, or achieving all-around improvements.},

  abstract     = {Although AI has been extensively adopted and has profoundly transformed our lives, it is not feasible to directly deploy large AI models on edge devices with limited resources. To enhance the performance of Edge Intelligence (EI), model split inference has been proposed. In this approach, an AI model is segmented into sub-models, with the most resource-intensive parts offloaded wirelessly to the edge server. This reduces the resource demands and inference latency on the device. However, previous studies have primarily focused on enhancing and optimizing system Quality of Service (QoS), often overlooking Quality of Experience (QoE), which is another crucial aspect for users. Even though QoE has been extensively studied in Edge Computing (EC), the distinct differences between task offloading in EC and split inference in EI, along with specific QoE issues that remain unaddressed in both fields, render these algorithms ineffective for edge split inference scenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces an effective resource allocation algorithm, dubbed ERA, which aims to: 1) expedite split inference in EI, and 2) balance inference delay, QoE, and resource consumption. ERA incorporates resource consumption, QoE, and inference latency to determine the most optimal model split and resource allocation strategies. Given that it is impossible to simultaneously minimize inference delay and resource consumption while maximizing QoE, we employ a gradient descent-based algorithm to find the best possible compromise. Furthermore, to address the complexity arising from parameter discretization in the gradient descent algorithm, we have developed a pipeline gradient descent approach, known as PipGD. We have also examined the properties of the proposed algorithms, including their convergence, complexity, and approximation error. The experimental results clearly show that ERA outperforms previous studies significantly in terms of performance.},

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages wireless channels' superposition property to achieve high spectral efficiency and efficient aggregation irrespective of device number. In this paper, we propose HEAirFed, integrating AirComp with the state-ofthe-art HE scheme CKKS for efficient privacy-preserving FL. In HEAirFed, we develop a ciphertext-oriented wireless communication module to ensure homomorphic operations leverage AirComp's superposition property, enabling correct decryption. We further build a rigorous error analysis model, derive the worst-case upper bound of approximation error, and characterize this bound's impact on the convergence guarantee of HEAirFed, measured by the optimality gap with bounded approximation error. Then, we minimize this gap and derive a near-optimal solution in semi-closed form. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets validate the ciphertext-oriented design's necessity, the error analysis's correctness, and demonstrate that HEAirFed achieves a substantial reduction in communication and aggregation latency compared to baseline, with minimal learning accuracy loss.},

In this paper, we propose a singular value decomposition (SVD) track matching scheme to obtain an effective radio map based on small scale crowd sensing data, which is a non-learning based system (SVD-CSP). SVD-CSP fuses received signal strength indicator (RSSI), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and magnetic field strength to label surrounding WiFi access points as marker points. The proposed scheme uses SVD method to directly compute the rotation matrix and displacement vector among the crowd sensing trajectories and attain the reliable tracks. The radio map is constructed and users are tracked according to our developed bidirectional Bayesian filter, which contains forward filter and reverse filter. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is embedded within the forward filter to improve the radio map quality. Meanwhile, the reverse filter fuses pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and radio map-based localization to track users. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-CSP can achieve robust localization using extremely sparse crowd trajectories (e.g., 4 trajectories in a 648 m2 scenario, 30 trajectories in a 2856 m2 scenario) without deep learning training or infrastructure knowledge.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), with parameter aggregated by a central node, the communication overhead is a substantial concern. To circumvent this limitation and alleviate the single point of failure within the FL framework, recent studies have introduced Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) as a viable alternative. Considering the device heterogeneity, and energy cost associated with parameter aggregation, in this paper, the problem on how to efficiently leverage the limited resources available to enhance the model performance is investigated. Specifically, we formulate a problem that minimizes the loss function of DFL while considering energy and latency constraints. The proposed solution involves optimizing the number of local training rounds across diverse devices with varying resource budgets. To make this problem tractable, we first analyze the convergence of DFL with edge devices with different rounds of local training. The derived convergence bound reveals the impact of the rounds of local training on the model performance. Then, based on the derived bound, the closed-form solutions of rounds of local training in different devices are obtained. Meanwhile, since the solutions require the energy cost of aggregation as low as possible, we modify different graph-based aggregation schemes to solve this energy consumption minimization problem, which can be applied to different communication scenarios. Finally, a DFL framework which jointly considers the optimized rounds of local training and the energy-saving aggregation scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than the conventional schemes with fixed rounds of local training, and consumes less energy than other traditional aggregation schemes.},

  abstract     = {Automotive Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is becoming an essential modality for autonomous vehicles to enable all-weather perception, especially when LiDAR and camera fail in foggy, rainy, or snowy conditions. It is expected that the mutual interference among multiple radars becomes a critical issue in dense traffic scenarios, which can severely degrade the radar performance and lead to accidents. Despite extensive interference mitigation techniques, none can meet the less valid signal distortion while high robustness requirements for automotive radar perception in dense traffic scenarios. To overcome this predicament, we propose mmMic, a novel multiple mutual interference mitigation system that can accurately separate interference and recover valid signals to maintain the reliability of the radar measurements. The key insight is to design an interference estimator that can accurately localize the interference signal according to its linear frequency modulation features in the time-frequency (TF) domain. In addition, mmMic also fully exploits undisturbed valid signal information within an extended time-frequency domain to reconstruct the damaged signal. Our experiments on a real testbed show that mmMic can improve SINR to interference-free levels from multiple radars, achieving an average SINR improvement of 17% compared to the best-performing baseline.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the success of large models has demonstrated the importance of scaling up model sizes. However, it is difficult to directly train large models locally on multiple mobile devices due to their intrinsic computational constraints. To address this challenge, it becomes a crucial need to train larger global models by training small local models on devices. As a distributed learning approach, federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train models locally and aggregate them to form the global model by sharing the updated parameters with the server, thus enabling the co-training of models. This promising feature has spurred an increasing interest in exploring the collaborative training of large models. Despite the advent of existing device-heterogeneity FL approaches, they still have limitations in fully covering the parameter space of the global model. To fill this gap, we propose a novel approach called FedBRB (Block- wise Rolling and weighted Broadcast). The core idea of FedBRB is to utilize local models of small devices to train all modules of a large global model and broadcast the trained parameters to the entire space, thereby enabling faster information sharing. This approach not only improves training efficiency but also fully utilizes limited computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that FedBRB can produce significant performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, this paper provides theoretical and experimental analyses of FedBRB convergence, thereby paving a theoretical ground and providing practical guidance for further research and application of the FedBRB method.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) aims to identify subtle impairments in hardware devices, which play an important role in the mobile environment security community. To identify various mobile devices in the complex electromagnetic environment, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been adopted to extract device hardware-related features. However, the single network structure has difficulty in comprehensive feature extraction, as many factors can introduce hardware impairments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model termed switching dynamical deep network (SDDN) for RFFI tasks, which can jointly extract both coarse-grained radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs) and fine-grained RFFs. Additionally, the proposed hybrid model consists of a probabilistic part and a deterministic part. Specifically, in the probabilistic part, the switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS) are incorporated to establish the correspondence between the signal slice and the feature extraction network (FEN). In the deterministic part, multiple independent FENs are established to extract the RFFs. Moreover, to automatically determine the suitable number of FENs, a Bayesian nonparametric prior distribution is placed over the probabilistic part. Finally, an end-to-end parameter optimization method that is based on variational inference and stochastic gradient descent is proposed. Experiments on a real-life Wi-Fi dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.},

However, relying on a single central processing unit (CPU) in CF massive MIMO systems is not scalable in practical networks, requiring the introduction of multiple CPUs for more efficient and feasible transmission. In this paper, we investigate a CF massive MIMO system with multiple CPUs. To obtain flexible and cost-efficient deployment, we propose to use wireless x-haul links instead of wired ones. More specifically, we assume that both the fronthaul links from the APs to the corresponding CPU and the backhaul links between CPUs operate under millimeter wave (mmWave) networks. Taking into account a tradeoff between the degree of centralized coordination and the signal overhead on the backhaul links, we consider four levels of multiple CPUs cooperation schemes from fully centralized to fully distributed. In addition, we propose a binary search method to allocate the backhaul capacities for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that mmWave backhaul amplifies the compression noise introduced by mmWave fronthaul, leading to a more pronounced impact on the SE of systems. In this case, the centralized processing scheme can generate more compression noise due to the larger data overhead on the backhaul link, making the distributed processing scheme a superior processing scheme, especially when dealing with a large number of APs or significant distances between CPUs.},

In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-USV mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture is proposed, where one RIS-carried tethered UAV (TUAV) and rotary-wing UAVs (RUAVs) are cooperatively dispatched to serve USVs bidirectional data computation with average AoI (AAoI) constraint. The minimization of weighted sum USVs AAoI and RUAVs flight energy is formulated by jointly considering RUAVs service duration indicators, TUAV-mounted RIS phase shift, TUAV hovering altitude, and RUAVs' trajectories. A heursitic solution is proposed to address this minimized issue. In particular, a novel mixed linear quadratic Lyapunov framework is utilized to transform the original long-term stochastic problem into a list of deterministic single-slot problems. Then, each single-slot problem is divided into two subproblems. First, the subproblem of RUAVs' trajectories is tackled by an enhanced whale optimization algorithm. Second, the subproblem of RUAVs service duration indicators, TUAV-mounted RIS phase shift and TUAV hovering altitude is addressed by an enhanced alternating optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic solution reduces long-term RUAVs flight energy consumption by approximately 50% while maintaining satisfactory USVs AAoI.},

This paper presents a game-theoretic framework to address the edge resource crowdsourcing problem, where mobile edge devices (MEDs) provide idle storage for content caching in exchange for rewards from a content provider (CP). We model the interaction between the CP and MEDs as a Stackelberg game, with the CP as the leader setting the reward structure and the MEDs as followers competing in a non-cooperative game for these rewards. We propose a novel privacy-preserving method to derive the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. Notably, our algorithm is designed to operate effectively in time-varying communication networks, addressing the high mobility inherent in MEC environments. This contrasts with state-of-the-art algorithms, which assume a static communication network among MEDs–an impractical condition that does not account for the mobility of MEDs during algorithm execution. Specifically, our approach employs consensus-based algorithms to compute the Nash equilibrium (NE) for MEDs, with MEDs exchanging NE profile estimates with neighbors via row-stochastic mixing matrices and performing gradient steps to optimize their utility in a fully decentralized manner. Based on the computed NE strategies, we propose a zeroth-order reward search algorithm for the CP to determine the optimal strategy for profit maximization. Our comprehensive analysis details the properties of the equilibrium and establishes the geometric convergence of the proposed algorithms to the NE. We also derive explicit bounds for the stepsizes based on the game's properties and the graphs' connectivity structure. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

In this paper, we propose CrossSense, a novel Cross-Technology Sensing (CTS) framework that enables sensing between incompatible WiFi and LoRa device. CrossSense recovers the fine-grained trajectory of a WiFi transmitter based on its emulated LoRa signals. To decompose the motion feature components of WiFi transmitter, we develop a chirp difference vector model that utilizes the energy peak within each chirp window for sensing. We model the relationship between sampling frequency offsets and oscillation frequency offsets among heterogeneous devices to guide the extraction of motion features from the emulated signal. We also propose a greedy-based peak enhancement method to calculate the optimized LoRa phases, minimizing the impact of phase discontinuity caused by cyclic prefix (CP) errors. We implement a prototype of CrossSense on the USRP platform.

  abstract     = {Complex action recognition aims to identify multiple actions over a long time. Multiple actions may occur at the same time (defined as simultaneous actions), and may occur after each other (defined as each action) Complex action recognition may suffer from two challenges. (1) Temporal repeated bias. The same action may repeat in a temporal duration. In this duration, the prediction may be biased to the majority of actions, which occur repeatedly in the past temporal frames. (2) Epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions. When there are multiple simultaneous actions in one frame, this frame's feature may result in the distribution of multiple actions overlapping each other. Without modeling proper relations between actions, the model may hinder accurately explaining certain categories in multiple actions (defined as the model's epistemic uncertainty). In this work, we propose an Instructive Probabilistic Transformer, which contains a probabilistic temporal memorizer, and a probabilistic prototype Transformer. First, to alleviate temporal repeated bias, we design a probabilistic temporal memory module, which learns probabilistic temporal gates to localize each action. The probabilistic gates instruct the selective memory of each action in long-term frames. Second, we cluster features to capture common action semantics among features (defined as action prototypes). To alleviate the epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions, we design a probabilistic prototype Transformer module. This module learns probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, which can ensure the separation between different prototypes. Third, to ensure the proper probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, we extend action loss with distribution loss to learn uncertainty-aware action loss. In uncertainty-aware action loss, the distribution loss measures the consistency between probabilistic relations and prototype relation distribution. The prediction uncertainty is learned by analyzing the entropy of multiple predictions, and helps to ensure the effect between action loss and distribution loss.

GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

Most existing methods for simultaneously segmenting point clouds and images rely heavily on the quantity and quality of the labeled training data. However, massive point-wise and pixel-wise labeling procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a parallel dual-stream network to handle the semi-supervised dual-modal semantic segmentation task, called PD-Net, by jointly utilizing a small number of labeled point clouds, a large number of unlabeled point clouds, and unlabeled images. The proposed PD-Net consists of two parallel streams (called original stream and pseudo-label prediction stream). The pseudo-label prediction stream predicts the pseudo labels of unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images. Then, the unlabeled data is sent to the original stream for self-training. Each stream contains two encoder-decoder branches for 3D and 2D data respectively. In each stream, multiple dual-modal fusion modules are explored for fusing the dual-modal features. In addition, a pseudo-label optimization module is explored to optimize the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PD-Net not only outperforms the comparative semi-supervised methods but also achieves competitive performances with some fully-supervised methods in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-high resolution (UHR) image segmentation is a challenging task that requires efficient processing of large images while maintaining high accuracy. Existing approaches usually employ both shallow and deep networks to extract high-resolution details and global context from different-resolution inputs, achieving a balance between performance, memory, and speed. However, these methods still rely on preserving relatively high-resolution features within the deep network, leading to increased time and memory costs. This also indicates that the full potential of the high-resolution information from the shallow network remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel framework called the Hierarchical Grafting Network (HGN), wherein the shallow network is hierarchically grafted to the deep network from multiple perspectives, enabling comprehensive utilization of the features from the shallow network. Our framework involves carefully designed global structure aggregated grafting and local structure aligned grafting mechanism, which progressively integrate semantic details and spatial structure from the shallow network to the deep network. In addition, to enhance the discriminative power of the high-resolution local features extracted by the shallow network, we introduce a shallow-deep contrastive loss to encourage the shallow network to learn semantically similar features to those of the deep network. Extensive experiments on several UHR image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art UHR methods. The results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of memory efficiency, accuracy, and speed.},

  abstract     = {Input diversity is an effective technique for crafting transferable adversarial examples that can deceive unknown AI models. Existing input-diversity-based methods typically use single input transformation, limiting targeted transferability and defense robustness. Combining different transformation types is challenging, as keeping increasing types would degrade semantic information and targeted transferability. This paper proposes a quality-aware transformation combination attack (TCA) that selects high-quality transformation combinations. The quality-aware selection enables expansion of transformation types, enhances input diversity, and hence improves targeted transferability and defense robustness. We first design a quality-evaluation framework to quantify the effectiveness of transformation combinations, which jointly considers convergence, transferability, and robustness. Only a small group (up to 10) of images are required for computation-efficient quality evaluation. Experiments validate TCA's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in adversarial transferability and robustness. When defenses are secured, the average targeted success rate of TCA with four transformation types (i.e., TCA-t4) outperforms the best baseline by 26%$\sim$42% on ImageNet.},

Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced FER method with an emotional-to-neutral transformation. Specifically, we formulate the FER problem as a process to match the similarity between a facial expression representation and text embeddings. Then, we transform the facial expression representation to a neutral representation by simulating the difference in text embeddings from textual facial expression to textual neutral. Finally, a self-contrast objective is introduced to pull the facial expression representation closer to the textual facial expression, while pushing it farther from the neutral representation. We conduct evaluation with diverse pre-trained visual encoders including ResNet-18 and Swin-T on four challenging facial expression datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FER methods. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/hangyu94/KE2NT.},

The current methods often overlook the disentanglement of underlying concepts and are restricted in terms of their ability to effectively capture the compositional variation mechanism. Moreover, the state-of-the-art techniques depend on additional clues for training, which is not feasible in real-world VQA scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel Disentanglement-based EquivAriant Learning (DEAL) framework for compositional VQA, which is guided exclusively by ground-truth answers. In DEAL, we employ causality-inspired interventions to disentangle concepts derived from visual and textual inputs within a re-encoding framework. Based on the principle of equivariance, we subsequently perform a compositional transformation on the inference input and impose the equivariant constraint on the output to augment the compositional reasoning capacity of the model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the benchmark CLEVR-CoGenT and GQA-SGL datasets validate the superiority of our proposed DEAL approach over the existing state-of-the-art methods for compositional VQA tasks in both visual and linguistic generalization settings.},

However, the majority of existing content remains in standard dynamic range (SDR) format. Therefore, the conversion of SDR content to HDRTV standards holds significant value. This paper delineates and analyzes the SDRTV-to-HDRTV conversion by modeling the formation of SDRTV/HDRTV content. The findings reveal that a naive end-to-end supervised training pipeline suffers from severe gamut transition errors. To address this, we propose a new three-step solution called HDRTVNet++, which includes adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement, and highlight refinement. The adaptive global color mapping step utilizes global statistics for image-adaptive color adjustments, followed by a local enhancement network for detail improvement. These two components are integrated as a generator, with GAN-based joint training ensuring highlight consistency. Our method, tailored for ultra-high-definition TV content, offers both effectiveness and computational efficiency in processing 4K resolution images. We also construct HDRTV1K, a dataset comprising HDR videos adhering to the HDR10 standard, featuring 1235 training and 117 testing images at 4K resolution. Furthermore, we employ five metrics to assess SDRTV-to-HDRTV performance. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and visually.

While recent advancements have explored innovative approaches, existing methods face critical limitations in clustering accuracy, feature discriminability, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise, hindering their practical deployment. In this paper, a self-supervised efficient low-pass contrastive graph clustering (SLCGC) is introduced for HSIs. Our approach begins with homogeneous region generation, which aggregates pixels into spectrally consistent regions to preserve local spatial-spectral coherence while drastically reducing graph complexity. We then construct a structural graph using an adjacency matrix A and introduce a low-pass graph denoising mechanism to suppress high-frequency noise in the graph topology, ensuring stable feature propagation. A dual-branch graph contrastive learning module is developed, where Gaussian noise perturbations generate augmented views through two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and a cross-view contrastive loss enforces structural consistency between views to learn noise-invariant representations. Finally, latent embeddings optimized by this process are clustered via K-means. Extensive experiments and repeated comparative analysis have verified that our SLCGC contains high clustering accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong robustness.

Despite the growing popularity of text-to-3D asset generation, its evaluation has not been well considered and studied. However, given the significant quality discrepancies among various text-to-3D assets, there is a pressing need for quality assessment models aligned with human subjective judgments. To tackle this challenge, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore the T23DA quality assessment (T23DAQA) problem in this work from both subjective and objective perspectives. Given the absence of corresponding databases, we first establish the largest text-to-3D asset quality assessment database to date, termed the AIGC-T23DAQA database. This database encompasses 969 validated 3D assets generated from 170 prompts via 6 popular text-to-3D asset generation models, and corresponding subjective quality ratings for these assets from the perspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence, respectively. Subsequently, we establish a comprehensive benchmark based on the AIGC-T23DAQA database, and devise an effective T23DAQA model to evaluate the generated 3D assets from the aforementioned three perspectives, respectively. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the projection videos of text-to-3D assets to extract 3D shape, texture and text-asset correspondence features, then fuses them to calculate the final three preference scores respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T23DAQA method in evaluating the quality of AI generated 3D asset, which is more consistent with human perception. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of text-guided 3D generation quality assessment, and our database and codes will be released to facilitate future research.},

However, previous methods focus only on method-specific clues, which easily lead to overfitting, while overlooking the crucial role of common forgery features. Additionally, they struggle to distinguish between uncertain novel classes in more practical open-world scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an innovative multi-DisentAnglement based conTrastive leArning framework, DATA, to enhance the generalization ability on novel classes for the open-world semi-supervised deepfake attribution (OSS-DFA) task. Specifically, since all generation techniques can be abstracted into a similar architecture, DATA defines the concept of ‘Orthonormal Deepfake Basis' for the first time and utilizes it to disentangle method-specific features, thereby reducing the overfitting on forgery-irrelevant information. Furthermore, an augmented-memory mechanism is designed to assist in novel class discovery and contrastive learning, which aims to obtain clear class boundaries for the novel classes through instance-level disentanglements. Additionally, to enhance the standardization and discrimination of features, DATA uses bases contrastive loss and center contrastive loss as auxiliaries for the aforementioned modules. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OSS-DFA benchmark, e.g., there are notable accuracy improvements in $2.55\% / 5.7\%$ under different settings, compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. In the quantitative assessments, the proposed method achieves average scores of 0.205 FADE, 7.688 Entropy, 0.628 UCIQE, and 0.775 FDUM across the UIEB and UIQS datasets. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing and low-light image enhancement tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/HouGuojia/UDHTV.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of AI-generated content brings significant concerns on the forensic and security issues such as source tracing, copyright protection, etc, highlighting the need for effective watermarking technologies. Font-based text watermarking has emerged as an effective solution to embed information, which could ensure copyright, traceability, and compliance of the generated text content. Existing font watermarking methods usually neglect essential font knowledge, which leads to watermarked fonts of low quality and limited embedding capacity. These methods are also vulnerable to real-world distortions, low-resolution fonts, and inaccurate character segmentation. In this paper, we introduce FontGuard, a novel font watermarking model that harnesses the capabilities of font models and language-guided contrastive learning. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on the pixel-level alteration, FontGuard modifies fonts by altering hidden style features, resulting in better font quality upon watermark embedding. We also leverage the font manifold to increase the embedding capacity of our proposed method by generating substantial font variants closely resembling the original font. Furthermore, in the decoder, we employ an image-text contrastive learning to reconstruct the embedded bits, which can achieve desirable robustness against various real-world transmission distortions. FontGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +5.4%, +7.4%, and +5.8% in decoding accuracy under synthetic, cross-media, and online social network distortions, respectively, while improving the visual quality by 52.7% in terms of LPIPS. Moreover, FontGuard uniquely allows the generation of watermarked fonts for unseen fonts without re-training the network.

Mainstream STR methods have achieved remarkable advancements by leveraging linguistic knowledge to implicitly address this challenge. In this paper, inspired by the correlation between recognizer performance and the distributional properties of character representations, as well as the inherent consistency between this correlation and supervised contrastive learning (SupCon), we thoroughly investigate how to integrate SupCon with an STR model to alleviate this challenge, and elucidate some dynamic behaviors underlying the performance improvements. Specifically, we analyze the SupCon-STR models instantiated with different projectors and evaluate their distributional properties through metrics, including intra-class compactness, inter-class separability, and feature redundancy, while assessing performances that involve in-domain accuracy and cross-domain recognition generalization. The main results reveal how the temperature $\tau$ and projectors affect the representation distribution, and highlight that suitable intra-class compactness and sufficient inter-class separability are key factors for delivering competitive performances in both in-domain and cross-domain STR scenarios. Moreover, these results also provide valuable insights into the design of SupCon-STR architectures for diverse resource constraints. Taking existing Chinese STR models as baselines, and combining SupCon-STR with them, the average improvements in cross-domain recognition performance are over 5% across 7 testing datasets. A new state-of-the-art accuracy of 77.19% on the Chinese Scene benchmark is also established.},

  abstract     = {How to effectively explore inter-frame information is critical for video denoising. Existing methods often rely on complex architectures, such as optical flow estimation and cross-frame self-attention, which introduce high computational costs and limit their practicality in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet efficient deep Frequency-Separable Temporal Network (FSTN) for video denoising. FSTN utilizes the multi-scale analysis capability of wavelet transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency information at the feature level, enabling faster processing while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. To further reduce computational complexity and enhance detail preservation, we develop a learnable high-frequency processing module that adaptively filters noise and recovers edge details. Additionally, to effectively utilize information from long-range frames, we propose a low-frequency propagation method equipped with a temporal feature alignment module. This method enables the efficient transfer of structural information from distant frames, ensuring temporal consistency and enhancing denoising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has 1.28× fewer network parameters than state-of-the-art efficient video denoising methods, such as BasicVSR++, and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance.},

Additionally, we present a boundary-enhanced module (BEM) to enhance boundary information using the cross-channel attention mechanism. To efficiently merge features from various levels and boundary features, we further present the feature fusion module (FFM). To optimize performance, the BASNet incorporates weighted binary cross-entropy loss, dice loss, and boundary loss, which can effectively leverage edge supervision while mitigating imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluation of five widely-used forgery detection datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the BASNet. Robustness experiments verify that the BASNet is robust enough to detect image splicing forgery across various common attacks.},

However, existing medical images face data leakage, pollution and vulnerability to attacks during transmission over wireless body area networks(WBANs). To address these issues, a privacy protection algorithm based on Hopfield cross neural network (HCNN) for medical data is proposed. Specifically, the HCNN model is first constructed and its dynamic behavior is analyzed, which is suitable for application to image encryption. Then, a confusion method of NZ fractal curve sorting matrix (NZ-FCSM) is designed to achieve good encryption effect. Subsequently, the secret image sharing (SIS) technique based on sharing matrix is introduced to enhance the algorithm robustness. Finally, an alignment embedding of double diamond prediction (AEDDP) method is proposed to implement lossless hiding of private information. The present issues in medical image protection include ensuring the security and effectiveness of encryption algorithms while maintaining the robustness and concealment of ciphertext data, and balancing the need for preservation with the limited resources of complex work environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves PSNR of 53 dB for the cipher image, more than 36 dB for the reconstructed image, and the information entropy of the secret image is over 7.99, and displays good robustness. These findings highlight the validity of the algorithm in medical image data privacy preserving applications that ensure confidentiality and extend to practical applications of concealed transmission of confidential information and secure multi-party transactions.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance in complex illumination scenarios. However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch. This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems. To efficiently compress multispectral object detection networks, we propose a novel distillation method, the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework. Unlike traditional distillation methods, the AMFD framework fully leverages the original modal features from the teacher network, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of the student network. Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms. This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module. Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection. Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP, SUNRGB-D and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision.

However, automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually appropriate comments that align with viewer interests. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation. This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with cross-attention mechanism to attend to each modality ensures that the generated comment reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large-scale, diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts.},

  abstract     = {The quantification of repetitive actions in videos, a task commonly referred to as Video Action Counting (VAC), is a critical challenge in understanding and analyzing content in sports, fitness, and daily activities. Traditional approaches to VAC have largely overlooked the nuanced irregularities inherent in action repetitions, such as interruptions and variable lengths between cycles. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel perspective on VAC, focusing on Irregular Video Action Counting (IVAC), which emphasizes the importance of modeling the irregular repetition priors present in video content. We conceptualize these priors through two key aspects: Inter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle Consistency ensures that the spatiotemporal representations across all cycle segments in a video remain homogeneous, thereby reflecting the uniformity of actions between different cycle segments. In contrast, Cycle-interval Inconsistency mandates a clear semantic distinction between the representations of cycle segments and intervals, acknowledging the inherent dissimilarities in content. To effectively encapsulate these priors, we introduce a novel methodology consisting of consistency and inconsistency modules, underpinned by a tailored pull-push loss ($\mathrm {P^{2}~L}$) mechanism. This approach employs a pull loss to enhance the cohesion among cycle segment features and a push loss to distinctly differentiate between cycle and interval segment features. Empirical evaluations on the RepCount dataset illustrate that our IVAC-$\mathrm {P^{2}~L}$ model sets a new benchmark in state-of-the-art performance for the VAC task. Moreover, our model demonstrates adaptability and generalization across diverse video content, achieving superior performance on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without necessitating dataset-specific fine-tuning. These findings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the complexities of irregular repetitions in videos but also open new avenues for future research in video understanding and analysis.},

  abstract     = {The perception-distortion- tradeoff reveals the limitation of current low-level deep learning paradigms, i.e., minimizing reconstruction distortion does not guarantee improved perceptual quality. Acknowledging the lack of a reliable perception-oriented optimization function, we are motivated to explore a flexible approach for enhancing perceptual quality by steering the tradeoff to prioritize perception. To this end, we reconsider the perception-distortion function by incorporating the Just-Noticeable-Distortion (JND) mechanism. We mathematically demonstrate that in the common image restoration process, altering the optimization target from natural images to distorted images—where the distortion intensity is constrained by the JND threshold and the distortion type aligns with that arising from the restorer itself—effectively obtained improved perception indices without any changes to the restorer or optimization function. Accordingly, to facilitate various low-level learning models, we are motivated to construct the first large-scale CNN-oriented JND image dataset. Our dataset comprises 500 natural images and 4,500 degraded versions generated by a series of autoencoders, as well as the actual JND judgment results collected through rigorous subjective testing from twenty volunteers. Finally, a learning-based JND inference model is established on the proposed dataset and employed in the proposed JND-based adaptation scheme, where the inferred JND images serve as pseudo-ground truth for the training or fine-tuning processes of low-level vision models. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution and end-to-end image compression across multiple models have shown encouraging improvements in perceptual quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Vision Graph Neural Network (ViG) is the first graph neural network model capable of directly processing image data. The community primarily focuses on the model structures to improve ViG's performance but lacks attention to its graph construction method. To avoid quadratic computational complexity, ViG uses clustering algorithms (K-nearest neighbor) to construct graph structures. Nevertheless, clustering algorithms introduce biases, which limit ViG's ability to obtain global information. To address this problem, we propose RandomViG, which abandons clustering algorithms and uses a random manner to obtain relationships between nodes. Our RandomViG is sparse in computation and can approximate a complete graph, enabling ViG to gain global interaction capability. In order to obtain the local dependence, we design a local feature extraction module for RandomViG. In addition, to alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we propose a novel method called MRN (maintaining relationships among nodes). Considering that the increased feature diversity does not necessarily lead to better performance, MRN does not aim to maximize the feature diversity of the model but instead strives to maintain consistency between the feature similarity and the inherent similarity of the original image. We validate our proposal in three major computer visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Without extra data, RandomViG-Ti achieves 79.4% ImageNet-1 K top-1 accuracy, outperforming the baseline (ViG) by 1.2%. Under the same model scale, our RandomViG performs better with fewer FLOPs compared with existing state-of-the-art models.},

From the perspective of feature distribution, the difference between OOD samples and ID samples can be decomposed into semantic shifts and covariate shifts. Most DL-based methods only extract deeper features, which represent semantic shifts, to discern feature variances in the data, ignoring the exploration of covariance shifts. In this paper, we propose a Shallow Layer-driven Enhanced OOD detection method (SLE), which enhances the difference of OOD samples by exploiting covariate shifts in shallow features. Specifically, it contains three main components: Hierarchical Feature Extractor (HFE), Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction Strategy (ADR), Cross-layer Score Aggregator (CSA). HFE is responsible for extracting both deeper and shallow features from the deep network. ADR adaptively reduces all hierarchical feature dimensionality according to sample characteristics, avoiding feature redundancy. CSA defines a novel confidence score for OOD samples, that effectively prevents confusion in the feature representation space at each layer. In SLE, these three closely related components cooperate with each other to effectively enhance the representation ability of OOD samples and divide OOD data better. We conduct extensive experiments to examine the performance of SLE in four benchmarks and discuss its individual components. This method performs well on the OOD datasets.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new paradigm called Active Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation (ACM-DA), wherein only cross-modal data from the source domain and uni-modal data from the target domain are utilized. To concurrently mitigate the adverse effects of both cross-modal domain shifts and unknown concepts, we propose a Curiosity-Driven Active Adaptation Network (CD-A2N), selectively annotating samples to maximize performance gain. First, we present Curiosity Arousal within Cross-modal Domain Adaptation (CA-CDA) to explore the complexity and novelty characteristics of target samples, while reducing cross-modal discrepancy and aligning source and target domains. Second, Curiosity-driven Active Learning (CAL) is devised to strategically select a subset of target samples for annotation, aiming to achieve more valuable data selection at a small labeling cost. Finally, we jointly train CA-CDA and CAL with the newly labeled target domain sub-dataset to alleviate the above issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CD-A2N provides an effective solution for achieving ACM-DA. Code will be available at https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/ACM-DA.},

  abstract     = {The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care promises a new horizon for therapist-client interactions, aiming to closely emulate the depth and nuance of human conversations. Despite the potential, the current landscape of conversational AI is markedly limited by its reliance on single-modal data, constraining the systems' ability to empathize and provide effective emotional support. This limitation stems from a paucity of resources that encapsulate the multimodal nature of human communication essential for therapeutic counseling. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation (MESC) dataset, a first-of-its-kind resource enriched with comprehensive annotations across text, audio, and video modalities. This dataset captures the intricate interplay of user emotions, system strategies, system emotions, and system responses, setting a new precedent in the field. Leveraging the MESC dataset, we propose a general Sequential Multimodal Emotional Support framework (SMES) grounded in Therapeutic Skills Theory. Tailored for multimodal dialogue systems, the SMES framework incorporates an LLM-based reasoning model that sequentially generates user emotion recognition, system strategy prediction, system emotion prediction, and response generation. Our rigorous evaluations demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances the capability of AI systems to mimic therapist behaviors with heightened empathy and strategic responsiveness. By integrating multimodal data in this innovative manner, we bridge the critical gap between emotion recognition and emotional support, marking a significant advancement in conversational AI for mental health support. This work not only pushes the boundaries of AI's role in mental health care but also establishes a foundation for developing conversational agents that can provide more empathetic and effective emotional support.},

Existing methods form activity parsing as a multi-task learning problem to predict multi-granular activity labels simultaneously, which ignores modeling the hierarchical structure and the fine-grained transitions of activity components at different levels. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Reasoning Graph (HARG) to model the hierarchical structure (i.e., object level $\rightarrow$ atomic action level $\rightarrow$ activity level) dynamically and precisely. To achieve that, an object reasoning graph (ORG) and an atomic action reasoning graph (ARG) are designed to reason fine-grained information transitions between multiple actors at different levels. In addition, an adaptive segmentation module (ASM) is investigated for bridging the gap among different levels, permitting step-by-step reasoning from the object level to the atomic action level. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two activity parsing datasets, achieving hierarchical modeling and fine-grained reasoning for activity understanding.

  abstract     = {Transformer displays the impressive capabilities on vision tasks. The built-in self-attention retains the quadratic computation burden in respect of the spatial resolution of image features. The traditional downsampling (e.g., average pooling) can reduce the resolution. Nonetheless, it may suffer from the dropping of detailed information. In this work, we propose an Efficient Wavelet Attention (EWA), which injects the wavelet transform and a Mean GELU (MGELU) function. Firstly, the wavelet transform enables the detailed information to participate in the efficient interaction modeling. Secondly, MGELU regards the statistical mean as reference and loosely passes the high relative responses. Building upon EWA, we present an effective Semantic-aware Wavelet Transformer (SWFormer), which is then employed for pyramid learning, including CNN feature hierarchy or Region of Interest (RoI) features. For the feature hierarchy, a Pyramid SWFormer (PSWFormer) incorporates SWFormer at each level to fit the bidirectional features. For RoIs, a Recognition-Localization SWFormer (RLSWFormer) is inserted into the head to fit their features from all levels. The effectiveness of our SWFormer is displayed experimentally on the MS COCO detection dataset and the Pascal VOC dataset. When exploiting Swin-small backbone, our SWFormer-based method acquires AP of 52.1 in the single-scale evaluation on the COCO test-dev set.

  abstract     = {In non-contact respiratory monitoring, reducing motion artifact and selecting the appropriate Region of Interest (ROI) pose significant challenges. Most motion artifact removal methods rely on signal periodicity assumptions, while respiratory signals usually are non-periodic in real-world scenarios. Existing automated ROI selection approaches are mostly primarily impacted by the texture of clothing, absence of chest landmarks, and obstruction of face. To improve the quality of respiratory signals, in this study, we propose a framework for automatic respiratory ROI selection based on video, namely, Optimizing Video-based Respiration Monitoring (OVRM), which consists of peak-trough adaptive motion artifact removal and characteristic-driven adaptive ROI selection. This motion artifact removal strategy removes motion artifacts by using a dynamic ratio-based judgment mechanism, and reconstructs signals using sinusoidal interpolation. The adaptive ROI method scores signals based on periodicity, similarity, smoothness, and energy, selecting the highest-scoring blocks as the ROIs to match respiratory signals efficiently. Experimental results, validated across four datasets, demonstrate that OVRM effectively reduces signal noise caused by subject movement and outperforms state-of-the-art non-contact respiratory monitoring algorithms.

  abstract     = {Currently, fine-grained skeleton action recognition based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has become an important research focus. Fine-grained action recognition refers to the accurate recognition of subtle, complex or detailed actions. This task is particularly challenging due to the limited appearance information in skeleton data and the limitations of predefined single-topology skeleton structures. To address these challenges, we propose an action-responsive contrastive network (ARCN). The network consists of two main components: an action-responsive graph convolutional network (ARGCN) with enhanced skeleton topology and a fine-grained action comparator (FAC) that uses feature contrastive learning to explore the latent space of motion features. The ARGCN contains two specialized modules: the action-responsive topology (ART) module, which captures important motion features through the learned action-specific topology structure matrix and multiscale temporal features; and the action-responsive attention (ARA) module, which learns complex spatiotemporal skeleton attention information. These modules jointly generate a multichannel cross-temporal dynamic skeleton joint attention topology map tailored for the specific action being analysed. To further clarify the fine-grained action feature differences, the FAC is integrated in some stages of the ARGCN. The FAC performs spatiotemporal decoupling of feature maps, classifies and contrasts similar and different fine-grained motion features, and builds a learnable latent space for fine-grained motion, thereby improving classification performance. Our model is evaluated on six public datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, UAV-Human, Finegym, and Diving48. It achieves 91.2% accuracy on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset X-Set, 97.2% accuracy on the NW-UCLA dataset, 44.6% accuracy on the UAV-Human dataset CSv1, 72.0% accuracy on the UAV-Human dataset CSv2, 95.3% accuracy on the Finegym dataset, and 54.3% accuracy on the Diving48 dataset, which are competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Displaying high-quality images on edge devices, such as augmented reality devices, is essential for enhancing the user experience. However, these devices often face power consumption and computing resource limitations, making it challenging to apply many deep learning-based image compression algorithms in this field. Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for image compression is an emerging technology that offers two key benefits compared to cutting-edge autoencoder models: low computational complexity and parameter-free decoding. It also outperforms many traditional and early neural compression methods in terms of quality. In this study, we introduce a new Mixed AutoRegressive Model (MARM) to significantly reduce the decoding time for the current INR codec, along with a new synthesis network to enhance reconstruction quality. MARM includes our proposed AutoRegressive Upsampler (ARU) blocks, which are highly computationally efficient, and ARM from previous work to balance decoding time and reconstruction quality. We also propose enhancing ARU's performance using a checkerboard two-stage decoding strategy. Moreover, the ratio of different modules can be adjusted to maintain a balance between quality and speed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves computational efficiency while preserving image quality. With different parameter settings, our method can achieve over a magnitude acceleration in decoding time without industrial level optimization or achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality compared with other INR codecs. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first INR-based codec comparable with Ballé et al. [1] in both decoding speed and quality while maintaining low complexity.},

The IIL task is divided into two phases: coarse and fine locating. In the coarse locating phase, we utilize an anomaly texture encoder to capture tampering traces in textures, employ a texture–context feature interaction strategy to effectively integrate texture features with contextual features, and utilize a pixel-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance feature clustering and model generalization. In the fine locating phase, we first enhance the receptive field features in the frequency domain by transforming the features and separately enhancing the low- and high-frequency components. Then, we utilize the coarse localization result to augment the model's sensitivity to tampered regions. Additionally, we introduce a progressive edge distribution guidance and reconstruction strategy that progressively refines the edges of the tampered regions at each level, ultimately generating refined localization results. To support the research and evaluation of the IIL task, we create the Inpaint32K dataset, which is characterized by its large scale, diversity, comprehensiveness, high quality, and authenticity. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that TEPR-Net has significant advantages in terms of localization performance, generalizability, extensibility, and robustness.},

Modern methods widely adopt multi-modal fusion based simple feature concatenation to enhance 3D scene understanding, resulting in generated multi-modal representations typically lack comprehensive semantic and geometry information. These methods focused on panoptic prediction in a single step also limit the capability to progressively refine panoptic predictions under varying noise levels, which is essential for enhancing model robustness. To address these limitations, we first utilize BEV space to unify semantic-geometry perceptual representation, allowing for a more effective integration of LiDAR and camera data. Then, we propose PrimePSegter, a progressively combined diffusion 3D panoptic segmentation model that is conditioned on BEV maps to iteratively refine predictions by denoising samples generated from Gaussian distribution. PrimePSegter adopts a conditional encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained panoptic predictions. Specifically, a multi-modal conditional encoder is equipped with BEV fusion network to integrate semantic and geometric information from LiDAR and camera streams into unified BEV space. Additionally, a diffusion transformer decoder operates on multi-modal BEV features with varying noise levels to guide the training of diffusion model, refining the BEV panoptic representations enriched with semantics and geometry in a progressive way. PrimePSegter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and competitive results on the SemanticKITTI, respectively.

Transferability and imperceptibility stand out as two crucial metrics for evaluating the quality of adversarial examples. However, achieving a balance between these two indicators poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose a low-frequency guided adversarial attack method (LGA) to generate adversarial examples with strong transferability and good imperceptibility. Specifically, we enhance the transferability of adversarial examples by increasing the diversity of attack algorithms, and introduce the guiding principle and the triplet loss constraint to ensure that the generated adversarial examples are optimized away from the class regions of the clean examples. We find that the low-frequency component in the frequency domain of the image contains the vast majority of the semantic information of the image. Therefore, we constrain the attack perturbations to low-frequency component space to enhance the covert nature while maintaining visual coherence, rendering the adversarial examples more difficult to perceive. We conduct extensive experiments on various models with different network structures and multiple defense strategies, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in the tradeoff between transferability and imperceptibility, achieving the SOTA performance.},

In this paper, we set out to fill this gap via a coherent Bidirectional Knowledge Permeation strategy called BiKop, which is grounded in human intuition: a class name description offers a more general representation, whereas an image captures the specificity of individuals. BiKop primarily establishes a hierarchical joint general-specific representation through bidirectional knowledge permeation. On the other hand, considering the bias of joint representation towards the base set, we disentangle base-class-relevant semantics during training, thereby alleviating the suppression of potential novel-class-relevant information. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable superiority of BiKop, particularly outperforming previous methods by a substantial margin in the 1-shot setting (improving the accuracy by 7.58% on miniImageNet).},

In this work, we propose a novel SSL paradigm for point cloud representation learning, called CCPoint, which incorporates a novel form of data corruption as a negative augmentation strategy. Specifically, we degrade the input point cloud with various corruptions and conduct contrastive learning among the augmented, raw, and corrupted points to learn robust and discriminative representations. To preserve the semantic structure of the point cloud even under heavy degradation, an auxiliary reconstruction decoder is introduced into the corruption branch to provide an additional supervision signal. We explore four families of corruptions—affine, noise, masking, and combined transformations. Different from previous methods that rely on multi-modal data or complex network architectures, CCPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used datasets (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart) with a lightweight and efficient structure, reaching top linear accuracies of 92.4% and 86.2% on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, respectively.},

To address these issues, we propose a novel progressive gradient-guided self-distillation method (PG2 SD) for keypoint detection, which possesses self-evolutionary learning capabilities. Specifically, we propose a progressive gradient constraint strategy (PGCS) that dynamically adjusts the gradient contributions of different samples, enabling the model to adapt to the evolving learning capability during training. On this basis, we propose a gradient-guided self-distillation strategy (G2 SDS), which integrates seamlessly with PGCS to alleviate the insufficient feature representation of hard samples in the early training stage. We further design a novel loss function to achieve dynamic collaboration between PGCS and G2 SDS, allowing G2 SDS to adaptively adjust the self-distillation parameters through the PGCS. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-theart performance on image matching, visual localization, and 3D reconstruction tasks without designing a proprietary network, indicating broad application prospects.},

However, practical adoption of ABS faces three fundamental challenges: vulnerability to key exposure and escrow risks, linear growth of computational cost, and insufficient robustness in multi-authority environments. To address these issues, we propose a forward secure and threshold authorized multi-authority ABS scheme called FORT in this paper. By employing a binary tree structure to divide multiple time periods, historical signatures remain valid even in the event of key exposure. Furthermore, to balance robustness and resistance to corruption while mitigating the key escrow problem, we construct a threshold authorized multi-authority structure based on Lagrange interpolation. This structure effectively reduces the impact of a single authority on the MIoT. Additionally, through the adoption of outsourced computation technology, which offloads complex computations in the signature and verification phases to the edge server, the computational burden for both the signer and verifier is significantly reduced to a small constant. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that the FORT scheme achieves forward security, collusion attack resistance, corrupt authority resistance and anonymity. Theoretical comparisons and simulation experiments demonstrate the lightweight nature of the FORT scheme in terms of computation and communication.},

  abstract     = {Food image composition requires the use of existing dish images and background images to synthesize a natural new image, while diffusion models have made significant advancements in image generation, enabling the construction of end-to-end architectures that yield promising results. However, existing diffusion models face challenges in processing and fusing information from multiple images and lack access to high-quality publicly available datasets, which prevents the application of diffusion models in food image composition. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality food image composite dataset, FC22k, which comprises 22,000 foreground, background, and ground truth ternary image pairs. Additionally, we propose a novel food image composition method, Foodfusion, which leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates a Fusion Module for processing and integrating foreground and background information. This fused information aligns the foreground features with the background structure by merging the global structural information at the cross-attention layer of the denoising UNet. To further enhance the content and structure of the background, we also integrate a Content-Structure Control Module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in image-language reasoning. However, they deal with Video Question Answering (VideoQA) insufficiently, especially for questions demanding causal-temporal reasoning. Typically, they directly concatenate features of uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs for VideoQA. This gives rise to two challenges. For one thing, uniformly sampled frames are discrete and separately distributed across different timestamps, disrupting the coherence of question-critical events or actions. For another, it considers every scene within videos equally and introduces redundant frames that may distract the model from discovering the truth. Towards this, we highlight the importance of identifying continuous frames that are crucial for answering the questions, and propose a lightweight and differentiable Coherence Recognizer (CoRe) to achieve this. Guided by the semantics of questions, CoRe computes scores recording the relevance between each frame and the question, and selects a set of continuous frames with the highest scores for answer prediction. Additionally, CoRe encodes the unselected frames into a short and coarse-grained representation as a completion of the general context. Equipped with CoRe, we can efficiently fine-tune the current MLLMs for VideoQA in an end-to-end manner, without suffering from the problems of incoherence or distraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements on several VideoQA benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The distribution of SAR targets generally conforms to a long-tailed distribution. Due to the existence of sample distribution bias and sample selection bias, training classifiers on this distribution of data often introduces spurious correlations between samples and classes. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage causal intervention framework. The core is that structural causality allows for independent interventions on multiple biases, thereby ensuring high-quality tail class predictions while maintaining unbiased performance for head classes. Firstly, we construct a structural causal graph for the long-tailed recognition task from causal perspective. Based on this graph, the causal paths underlying the two types of biases are identified. Secondly, we design a data augmentation method named DiagPatch-M, which identifies causal features within samples. In this process, these generated patches randomly integrate causal and non-causal features from two different samples, disrupting the original recognition process and effectively eliminating biases induced by sample selection. Thirdly, we design an unbiased structural risk minimization (USRM) optimization strategy, which eliminates the “head preference” of conventional models and the “tail preference” of modified models. This strategy reduces the bias introduced by the model's dependence on the original sample distribution, and achieves stable recognition under different sample distributions. Experimental results on two long-tailed and two balanced datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our model surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicating the efficacy of our proposed framework in tackling the challenges posed by the long-tailed distribution in SAR target recognition.},

However, progressively deeper or wider stacked network cause the expensive computation cost, which hinders their effective deployment in resource-constrained edge clouds or end devices. In this paper, we propose DTSNet, a dynamic transformer slimming model, which scales vision transformers (ViTs) down across layers from both of the model depth and input width. This is the first time to explore the joint reduction of input tokens and model parameters for ViTs under maintaining performance. Specifically, DTSNet adopts a diversity-enhanced weight sharing module to reduce network parameters, where the weight knowledge of multiple adjacent blocks is effectively integrated into one block. Furthermore, DTSNet designs a unified and massively scalable token pruning mechanism that dynamically discarding less important tokens with a model-driven manner, by introducing a series of discriminant parameters, which is a simple change to the common architecture of vision transformers. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify that DTSNet is able to yield high efficacy in compressing parameter space and accelerating model inference. DTSNet-T/-S/-B on ImageNet achieves 3.0M/11.1M/42.9M parameters and 0.8/2.9/13.7 GFLOPs, where number of parameters are reduced by 48%$\sim$51% and inference speed are improved by 1.3$\times \sim 1.5\times$.

  abstract     = {Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been obtained.},

  abstract     = {Recently, generative models such as diffusion models (DMs) have gained prominence in various applications, and there is a growing demand for their deployment on resourceconstrained devices. Model pruning provides an effective solution by reducing the model redundancy without significantly impacting performance. However, most existing model pruning methods are designed for classification models and often lead to substantial performance degradation when applied to generative models. To address this issue, we propose Comp-Diff, a novel two stage framework of pruning and knowledge distillation tailored for diffusion models. In the pruning stage, we propose a new structured content-aware pruning (CaP) method within CompDiff to identify and preserve informative units (filters/channels) that actually contribute to the generative capability of the model. Specifically, we introduce input perturbations to the pre-trained model and measure each unit's importance score using gradients induced by these perturbations. Units with higher importance scores are considered more informative and are retained to maintain the model's generative power. In the fine-tuning stage of Comp-Diff, we propose the distribution-aware knowledge distillation (DaKD) method, which effectively transfers finegrained knowledge from the original model to the pruned one on both attention and noise distribution levels. In addition, DaKD includes an adversarial loss to improve the quality and diversity of generated outputs. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply the proposed Comp-Diff on three representative tasks: unconditional image generation, conditional image generation, and text-to-image generation. Extensive experiments on both multi-step and one-step diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently yields compact models and outperforms existing pruning techniques by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Existing online video super-resolution methods utilize implicit memories of previous frames to provide reference information, which have a single memory stream path and are highly dependent on the continuous memory stream. However, video capture in real-world scenes is typically affected by abnormal exposures resulting in sudden changes of lightness thus interrupting the memory stream, while long-term memories suffer from memory vanishing problems during transmission. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-memory streams based online video super-resolution paradigm that adaptively corrects for abnormal exposures and creates multi-memory streams to accurately converge long-term memories. Specifically, we first propose an exposure detection-correction module, which utilizes optical flow overfitting property and temporal lightness information to detect and correct abnormal exposures to avoid interruption of memory streams. In addition, we propose a dynamic-static decoupled alignment strategy, which can adaptively select the alignment method based on pixel displacement, thus accurately aggregating past long-term memories to create multiple memory streams. Further, we propose an adaptive memory fusion module to mine complementary information between multiple memory streams to solve the memory vanishing problem. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms existing video super-resolution methods on complex exposure datasets. We also conduct detailed ablation experiments to analyze and validate our contributions. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/GZ-T/MMVSR.},

In this paper, we point out that even clean query images can be dangerous, inducing malicious target retrieval results, like undesired or illegal images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study data poisoning attacks against deep hashing (PADHASH). Specifically, we first train a surrogate model to simulate the behavior of the target deep hashing model. Then, a strict gradient matching strategy is proposed to generate the poisoned images.

Uncertain rotations and scale variations of targets in UAV images, coupled with complex environmental factors, hinder existing methods from extracting robust feature representations. Some methods either make minor modifications to the traditional model architecture or apply simple image rotations but still fail to effectively address the challenges of UAV person ReID. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Data Augmentation and Rotation Invariance (DARI) algorithm. First, rotation-invariant convolution is introduced to adaptively extract features, mitigating the uncertainty caused by target rotation. Second, a refined data augmentation correction strategy is employed to reduce noise interference by increasing the richness of global features at different stages. Additionally, considering that multiple features of the same identity should yield consistent recognition result, invariant constraints are designed to enhance the clustering effect. We conducted extensive experiments on both UAV and fixed-camera datasets. The results on PRAI-1581 demonstrate a 5.6% and 6.1% improvement in mAP and Rank-1, respectively, compared to baseline. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of UAV ReID, demonstrating its robustness and superiority.

To eliminate the laborious cost of dataset collection and pixel-level annotation, in this work, we employ Stable Diffusion to synthesize data and subsequently automate annotation for the SOD task. Firstly, we design a unified prompt and ChatGPT4 driven diverse prompts, which guide generating images with simple and complex scenes using Stable Diffusion. Secondly, the reliable pseudo-labels of these synthetic images are generated. For simple images, we propose the simple pseudo-label generation (SPLG) strategy which combines SAM segmentation and CLIP classifier, then train the initial SOD model. For complex images, we utilize the inference capability of the initial SOD model to generate pseudo-labels using the complex pseudo-label generation (CPLG) strategy, and employ iterative training to dynamically update the pseudo-labels. Finally, we design a simple yet effective SOD model which combines a feature fusion module (FFM) and an edge enhancement module (EEM), the former is employed to extract saliency via fusing high-level features, and the latter extracts spatial positional information from low-level features to enhance the edges of saliency results. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our method outperforms the unannotated methods, and also demonstrates better or comparable performance than weak annotation based methods.

Although deep-learning-based subspace clustering, typically referred to as deep subspace clustering (DSC), has significantly improved clustering accuracy, existing DSC models still struggle to capture a comprehensive and compact latent representation as they generally explore the spatial domain to extract useful information and face difficulty in balancing the high mutual and low redundant information between the original input space and latent subspace. This leads to the performance of the model being dependent on initialization, resulting in a lack of stability. In this study, a novel network is proposed to extract features in both the frequency domain and spatial domain. We introduce three types of ResBlocks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), or discrete wavelet transform (DWT) frequency domains separately to learn both the low-frequency and high-frequency information in the proposed networks. Additionally, to extract concise and rich latent representations, IB loss is employed by deriving a variational lower bound on the IB objective.

  abstract     = {Prompt tuning has been proven effective for Domain Generalization (DG) by enhancing the generalization capability of visual-language models with fewer learnable tokens. Existing methods adopt mostly inferring global-level individual prompts for the whole dataset to capture domain-invariant knowledge across different domains. However, since domain shifts exist, a single global-level individual prompt is easily overfitted to source domain datasets, thus lacking generalizability to the whole dataset's feature distribution. Moreover, fluctuations in the generalization performance during the training process in DG problems often pose significant challenges to model selection strategies. To address the aforementioned problems, inspired by the Mixture-of-Expert (MOE) and knowledge distillation, we propose a novel Multiple Local Prompts Distillation (MLPD) method to inject the knowledge of multiple local prompts into a unique global prompt, improving both the generalization and discriminative ability. To ensure the diversity of local prompts, we split the whole dataset into several subsets to infer the discriminative local prompts for each subset, which is further applied to generate the generability global prompt. Formally, for each subset, Meta Prompt Tuning (MPT) is proposed to constrain each local prompt to capture both the domain-specific and domain-shared generalization knowledge on the basis of the domain label and meta-learning mechanism. After that, Prompt Knowledge Distillation (PKD) is proposed to distill the knowledge captured in the local-level prompts into the global-level prompt with prompt-level and feature-level knowledge distillations. The final evaluation on multiple benchmarks underscores the effectiveness of the proposed MLPD, e.g., achieving mAPs of 97.3%, 84.8%, 85.2%, 57.3%, and 60.7% on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, respectively.},

  abstract     = {To further promote the development of multimodal point cloud completion, we contribute a large-scale multimodal point cloud completion benchmark ModelNet-MPC with richer shape categories and more diverse test data, which contains nearly 400,000 pairs of high-quality point clouds and rendered images of 40 categories. Besides the fully supervised point cloud completion task, two additional tasks including denoising completion and zero-shot learning completion are proposed in ModelNet-MPC, to simulate real-world scenarios and verify the robustness to noise and the transfer ability across categories of current methods. Meanwhile, considering that existing multimodal completion pipelines usually adopt a unidirectional fusion mechanism and ignore the shape prior contained in the image modality, we propose a Dual-Modality Feature Interaction Network (DuInNet) in this paper. DuInNet iteratively interacts features between point clouds and images to learn both geometric and texture characteristics of shapes with the dual feature interactor. To adapt to specific tasks such as fully supervised, denoising, and zero-shot learning point cloud completions, an adaptive point generator is proposed to generate complete point clouds in blocks with different weights for these two modalities. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC and ModelNet-MPC benchmarks demonstrate that DuInNet exhibits superiority, robustness and transfer ability in all completion tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Box-it-to-Bind-it (B2B) module-a novel, training-free approach for improving spatial control and semantic accuracy in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. B2B targets three key challenges in T2I: catastrophic neglect, attribute binding, and layout guidance. The process encompasses two main steps: (i) Object generation, which adjusts the latent encoding to guarantee object generation and directs it within specified bounding boxes, and (ii) Attribute binding, ensuring that generated objects adhere to their specified attributes in the prompt. B2B is designed as a compatible plug-and-play module for existing T2I models like Stable Diffusion and Gligen, markedly enhancing models' performance in addressing these key challenges. We assess our technique on the well-established CompBench and TIFA score benchmarks, and HRS dataset where B2B not only surpasses methods specialized in either attribute binding or layout guidance but also uniquely excels by integrating these capabilities to deliver enhanced overall performance.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in point cloud compression (PCC) is how to evaluate the perceived distortion so that the codec can be optimized for perceptual quality. Current standard practices in PCC highlight a primary issue: while single-feature metrics are widely used to assess compression distortion, the classic method of searching point-to-point nearest neighbors frequently fails to adequately build precise correspondences between point clouds, resulting in an ineffective capture of human perceptual features. To overcome the related limitations, we propose a novel assessment method called RBFIM, utilizing radial basis function (RBF) interpolation to convert discrete point features into a continuous feature function for the distorted point cloud. By substituting the geometry coordinates of the original point cloud into the feature function, we obtain the bijective sets of point features. This enables an establishment of precise corresponding features between distorted and original point clouds and significantly improves the accuracy of quality assessments. Moreover, this method avoids the complexity caused by bidirectional searches. Extensive experiments on multiple subjective quality datasets of compressed point clouds demonstrate that our RBFIM excels in addressing human perception tasks, thereby providing robust support for PCC optimization efforts.},

We propose a new feature recombination mechanism involving refining feature extraction and flexible concatenation. It includes the HFConv (Hybrid Flexibility Convolution) module, the MFD (Multivariate Flexibility Downsampling) module, and the DFSPP (Deformable and Flexible Spatial Pyramid Pooling) module. Specifically, the HFConv module employs feature refinement and flexible connection strategies to optimize feature representation and reduce redundancy in a dynamic way, acquiring diverse feature information from local and surrounding regions. The MFD module leverages multiple downsampling methods to address the issue of feature redundancy that may arise from a single downsampling method, thereby enhancing feature diversity. The DFSPP module learns an offset corresponding to the pooling kernel size, allowing for the extraction of the most critical information in a dynamic manner. By incorporating these modules into the YOLO architecture, we develop a more robust network called FRFCNet, and the experimental results show a notable 4.1% and 2.8% improvement in AP values on the VOC2012 and COCO2017 datasets, respectively, compared to the baseline (YOLOV7-Tiny-SiLu), outperforming current one-stage detectors.},

Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves state-of-the-art results, with 77.8% and 80.4% rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.

This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial and medical datasets with diverse attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance.

Malicious users can easily leak sensitive information like business secrets and research data by taking a screenshot and spreading onto the Internet. While existing watermarking schemes serve as useful tools for leakage tracing, they fall short in the scenario of arbitrary screenshot. Most current methods are file-targeted, focusing on embedding watermark for a single file of one type at a time, making it hard to handle arbitrary content on screen. To address the issues above and better satisfy the need of the scenario, we propose ScreenGuard, a novel watermarking scheme targeted for the screen itself to protect arbitrary screen content shown on it. Unlike previous watermarking schemes, ScreenGuard does not modify the content itself. Instead, we generate a transparent mask template based on the watermark, tile it to the size of the screen to form a complete transparent mask, and overlay this mask onto the screen. This ensures that any screenshots taken will contain our watermark. We then train a locator and a decoder to extract watermarks from suspected leaked screenshots to trace leaks to their source. We summarized five properties that needs to be satisfied in the scenario of arbitrary screenshot (Generalizable, Unseeable, Adaptable, Robust, Dynamic) and evaluate our method on these criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenGuard meets these five properties effectively, showcasing its superiority and broad practical applications.},

However, previous works directly align the feature space with CLIP and fail to learn the semantic knowledge effectively. In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin.},

Recently, a few transformer based methods are proposed to address this issue by transferring self-attention into task-specific attention. However, these methods utilize shared task-specific attention modules across the whole incremental learning process, and are unable to achieve the balance between consolidation and plasticity, i.e., to remember the knowledge learned from previous tasks and absorb the knowledge from the current task simultaneously. Motivated by the mechanism of LSTM and hippocampus memory, we point out that dual attention on long and short-term memories can handle the consolidation-plasticity dilemma of Class-IL. Typically, we propose Dual-Attention Transformers (DAFormer) to learn external attention and internal attention. The former utilizes sample-dependent keys which exclusively focused on the new tasks, while the latter consolidates the knowledge from previous tasks by using sample-agnostic keys. We present two editions of DAFormer: DAFormer-S and DAFormer-M: the former utilizes shared external keys and maintains a small parameter size, while the latter utilizes multiple external keys and enhances the long-term memory. Furthermore, we propose the $K$-nearest neighbor invariant based distillation scheme, which distills knowledge from previous tasks to current task by maintaining the same neighborhood relationship of each sample over old and new models. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-subset and ImageNet-full demonstrate that DAFormer significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art parameter-static and parameter-growing methods.},

Some approaches utilize graph neural networks that use interaction behavior to establish relationships between entities, providing a comprehensive understanding of user interests. However, the impact of consistent semantics across various types, fields, and perspectives of social media information on user preferences is overlooked, i.e. the multidimensional consistency of user preferences. This oversight results in graph node representations that inadequately reflect user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-layer transfer learning network (MTLG) for CDR based on graph node representation enhancement via multi-dimensional consistent user preferences. Firstly, the model introduces a set of globally shared semantic units to perform different-grained semantic alignment of multiple media information without clear alignment boundaries, thereby modeling multi-dimensional consistent user preference features. These features are then seamlessly integrated with the initial high-order graph structure embedding features, thus significantly improving the quality of graph node representation. Secondly, the model innovatively designs a multi-layer transfer learning network that hierarchically aligns the domain distribution differences. It calculates the similarity between domains to derive layer weights for more precise transfer learning, thereby mitigating the possibility of information error accumulation resulting from inaccurate feature aggregation processes. We conducted numerous experiments on 3 scenarios, including 7,954,943 rating information from the Amazon dataset. The results indicate that MTLG's recommendation accuracy surpasses those of state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the challenge lies in avoiding the texture-copy artifacts issue caused by structural inconsistencies between two modalities. To mitigate, we propose a cross-modality and cross-scale guided depth super-resolution network (D2CNet). We first design a novel two-stage feature integration module to effectively fuse multi-modal RGB and depth while minimizing texture-copy artifacts. That is, a cross-modality fusion stage transfers consistent structures from RGB to depth in a multi-scale manner, and a cross-scale refinement stage mitigates inconsistent structures across modalities. In addition, we design a convolution group as the basic module to well extract high-frequency features and an LR and HR domain projection strategy to enrich features between the fusion and refinement stages. We then develop a new network architecture by progressively repeating the feature integration module and the convolution group, which is flexibly controllable to strike a balance between accuracy and cost for easy implementation in real world. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our D2CNet consistently achieves superior accuracy and generalization ability across sampling scales in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  abstract     = {Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to identify novel compositions formed by known primitives (attributes and objects). Motivated by recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP, many methods attempt to fine-tune CLIP for CZSL and achieve remarkable performance. However, the existing CLIP-based CZSL methods focus mainly on text prompt tuning, which lacks the flexibility to dynamically adapt both modalities. To solve this issue, an intuitive solution is to additionally introduce visual prompt tuning. This insight is not trivial to achieve because effectively learning prompts for CZSL involves the challenge of entanglement between visual primitives as well as appearance shifts in different compositions. In this paper, we propose a novel Synergetic Prompts as Disentanglement Queries (SPDQ) framework for CZSL. It can disentangle primitive features based on synergetic prompts to jointly alleviate these challenges. Specifically, we first design a low-rank primitive modulator to produce synergetic adaptive attribute and object prompts based on prior knowledge of each instance for model adaptation. Then, we additionally utilize text prefix prompts to construct synergetic prompt queries, which are used to resample corresponding visual features from local visual patches. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks demonstrate that our SPDQ approach achieves state-of-the-art results.},

To address this issue, we introduce Click2Trimap, an interactive model that is capable of predicting high-quality trimaps and alpha mattes with minimal user click inputs. By analyzing real users' behavioral logic and the characteristics of trimaps, we successfully propose a powerful iterative three-class training strategy and a dedicated simulation function, making Click2Trimap exhibit versatility across various scenarios. Compared with all existing trimap-free matting methods, Click2Trimap achieves superior performance in quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on synthetic and real-world matting datasets. In particular, in a user study, Click2Trimap yields high-quality trimap and matting predictions in just 5 seconds per image on average, demonstrating its substantial practical value for use in real-world applications.},

However, in screen-camera scenarios, uncontrolled shooting environments, various display devices, and different lens types introduce more complex noise into the watermarked images. Because some noise generated during the screen-camera process cannot be quantitatively analyzed, the integrity of the embedded watermark is compromised, making copyright verification and information acquisition still difficult. To solve this problem, we establish a large-scale screen-camera image dataset (SCISet) and propose a noise simulation network (NoS-Net). Specifically, we obtain 36,000 screen-camera images under various shooting environments with multiple types of screens and cameras. Then, we use SCISet to train the proposed NoS-Net based on the U-Net architecture, which can learn multi-level and complementary feature information of screen-camera images, enhancing its ability to simulate complex noise. Experimental results show that integrating the proposed NoS-Net into mainstream screen-camera resilient watermarking methods significantly improves their ability to resist screen-camera noise attacks. Furthermore, the diversity of SCISet plays an important role in advancing robust watermarking research.},

However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and total Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.},

In this paper, two unique penalty terms are respectively incorporated into the loss functions of the discriminator and the generator of GAN to promote the generated samples to exhibit not just statistical but also spatial information consistency with the minority samples, thereby alleviating the issue of mode collapse. In contrast to other studies that fix the coefficient of the penalty terms, the optimal coefficients of the penalty terms are adaptively searched using a meta-learning approach, where Bayesian optimization is firstly employed to effectively handle situations involving small size of minority samples in the imbalanced data. We call the proposed model as META_GAN.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the underperformance of VLMs and propose a hierarchical inference framework to address this issue. Specifically, we prompt the large language models to generate sentencelevel descriptors for class labels and conduct the open vocabulary classification by computing the average similarity between the image and each descriptor. A reweighting mechanism is further proposed to filter out uninformative descriptors. To mitigate model bias incurred by the long-tail distribution, we propose a feature adapter with the logit adjustment technique and finetune the CLIP model via visual prompt tokens. We introduce the Shared Feature space Mixup (SFM) to enhance the interaction between modalities to address tail visual feature insufficiency. Finally, we propose a hierarchical inference manner to combine the aforementioned proposals.

Existing approaches involve extracting features from the input video and implementing regression based on those features.

This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multi-branch architecture designed to capture a broad spectrum of video dynamics at varying levels of granularity. Specifically, we enhance video representation in the flow-guided branch by integrating optical flow with video features. This combination of multimodal features offers a more comprehensive context of global motion. Meanwhile, the momentfocused branch is tailored to extract frame-specific features, constructing two distinct quality-based representations with different focuses on moments, which achieves adaptive clues aggregation. Furthermore, the detail-aware branch leverages multiscale deep embeddings from a hierarchy convolutional neural network to capture fine-grained spatial information, which is useful when objects have complex spatial changes. Finally, a post-fusion strategy is employed to merge outputs from all branches, contributing to the comprehensive action quality assessment. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets, FineDiving, MTLAQA, and AQA-7, demonstrate the superiority of our model in providing reliable assessments of action quality.},

However, the complex nature of the real-world Internet, characterized by heavy-tailed behavior, diversity, and unpredictability, hinder the effective learning of off-the-shelf reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABR algorithms. As a result, existing methods inevitably fail to achieve optimal performance under various network conditions and user QoE objectives. We propose Fortuna, a novel offline meta RL ABR algorithm that can effectively learn from these heavy-tailed internet data features and become more practical. Fortuna is primarily divided into two phases. In the offline phase, Fortuna utilizes diverse offline data for learning to reduce the costly online RL interaction expense, while in the online phase, we gradually increase video streaming sessions complexity through curriculum learning to quickly adapt to specific network conditions. Fortuna then utilizes meta-learning to optimize ABR policies and enhance generalization. Additionally, to better learn network features, Fortuna further optimizes QoE by learning low-level TCP congestion control information. Experimental results from trace-driven and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Fortuna enhances learning efficiency by more than 7.5%-4 ×, reduces stall time by 4.6%-14.2%, and generalizes to different network conditions and video streams.},

The latent representation created by deep learning methods inherently contains all visual features, without a computationally expensive synthesis process at the decoder. This paper is an invited extension of a previous solution for JPEG AI compressed domain face detection that adapts a RetinaFace-based detector to operate directly on the latent tensor. In addition to a former single-scale bridging solution, this work provides a novel multi-scale bridging architecture to enable a more effective multi-scale compressed domain face detection. The results show a significant performance gain, improving accuracy up to 20% for detection of tiny faces on the WIDER FACE dataset compared to single-scale bridging, and further narrowing the gap when compared to detection on uncompressed or JPEG AI decoded images. Furthermore, since the computationally expensive decoding step is bypassed and since the bridges consist of lower-complexity networks, the overall processing cost is significantly reduced. Single and multi-scale bridging, respectively, have about 10% and 32% the complexity of applying pixel domain face detection on decoded images. The proposed architecture is expected to be extended to other multiscale sensitive vision tasks, as JPEG AI is not specifically designed for any single downstream application.},

CVAC is more consistent with human understanding than VAD, but it has not been well explored. We constructed a large-scale benchmark CVACBench to lead this research.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised text-based person re-identification (Text-ReID) confronts the challenge of matching target person images with textual descriptions, hindered by the absence of identity annotations during training. Traditional approaches, which rely solely on global features, overlook the rich, fine-grained information within both text and image modalities. Besides, merely aligning features at the semantic level is insufficient due to the significant differences in feature representation spaces between the two modalities. Existing methods also neglect the information inequality caused by person-irrelevant factors in images. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Attribute-Centric Cross-modal Alignment (ACCA), specifically designed to overcome these issues. Our approach concentrates on two main aspects: visual-text attribute alignment and prediction distribution alignment. To effectively capture fine-grained information without identity labels, we implement a visual-text attribute alignment method based on momentum contrastive learning to synchronize visual and textual attribute features within a unified embedding space. We also propose a unique strategy for negative sample filtering and enrichment, creating robust and comprehensive negative attribute sample spaces to support the attribute alignment. Additionally, we establish two methods of label-free prediction distribution alignment to encourage the learning of invariant feature representations across modalities. The first method, bias-reduction distribution alignment, aligns features and predictions within each text-image pair by utilizing semantic information from the text and reduces the impact of person-irrelevant factors in images. The second method, global-attribute distribution alignment, enhances the interaction between global and local prediction distributions across visual and textual modalities.

  abstract     = {The active speaker detection task is to determine whether a person is speaking or not across a series of video frames. Existing methods heavily rely on facial information within the annotated face bounding boxes for cross-modal learning with audio. This leads to a substantial decline in detection performance when facial cues are unclear, such as in cases of face occlusion or low-resolution facial appearances. In this paper, we extend the perception scale using only face bounding box annotations to model both facial and gestural cues, addressing the over-reliance on facial cues in active speaker detection. We propose a novel graph neural network that models inter-speaker interactions and integrates various cues from individual speakers. The final detection results are obtained through a binary graph node classification task. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset (mAP: 95.6%) and the ASW dataset (mAP: 99.4%), with a model size only 21% that of the second-best method. Additionally, when facial cues are of poor quality, our method demonstrates a significant performance advantage over existing approaches.

  abstract     = {In the field of multi-view clustering, latent representations are often employed to address the challenge posed by low-quality data. Traditional approaches typically assume that multiple views are fully dependent, directly learning a common latent representation from the observed data. However, this assumption is overly restrictive in real-world scenarios and may overlook valuable information, as the independence of different views can reveal critical view-specific characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we propose learning Orthogonal Latent Representations for Multi-View Clustering (OLR-MVC), which jointly captures both cross-view dependence and independence. Specifically, our model maps multi-view data into shared and private latent spaces using distinct projection bases. To accurately capture both dependence and independence, we enforce orthogonality between the shared and private latent representations while also encouraging pairwise orthogonality among private representations. Furthermore, we leverage the self-expressive property of these latent representations to capture global data structures. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that OLR-MVC outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.},

However, haze reduces both the color and polarization information of a scene. While existing single-image dehazing methods can restore color information, they are poor at recovering polarization information. Furthermore, current polarization-based dehazing approaches neglect the physical mechanisms of polarization degradation, resulting in inaccurate reconstruction of polarization information. In this paper, we propose a novel polarization dehazing algorithm, along with a polarization degradation model, to accurately recover both polarization and color information. First, we combine two key characteristics (the polarization achromatism prior and polarization attenuation prior) with the polarization degradation model to precisely reconstruct the scene's polarization. Then, we utilize the reconstructed polarization information to recover the color information of the scene. Finally, a multi-scale fusion optimization framework is introduced to further enhance the image quality. Our method shows excellent performance on both real-world indoor and outdoor polarized images, outperforming existing dehazing algorithms in both objective evaluation metrics and subjective visual assessment.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task than traditional DG tasks due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the vulnerability of subtle features leads to a severe deterioration in model performance. Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning the commonality and specificity within categories. Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is accomplished through joint optimization of five constraints: a decorrelation function applied to disentangled segments, three constraints ensuring common feature consistency and specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration term. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2% in FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis on explicit concept matching intensity between the shared concepts among categories and the model channels, along with experiments on various mainstream model architectures, substantiates the validity of FS.},

Under special scenarios, users may only need the details of certain dimensions of an object. In this paper, we propose a training-free object description refinement pipeline, Dimension Tailor, designed to enhance user-specified details in object descriptions. This pipeline includes three steps: dimension extracting, erasing, and supplementing, which decompose the description into user-specified dimensions. Dimension Tailor can not only improve the quality of object details but also offer flexibility in including or excluding specific dimensions based on user preferences. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Dimension Tailor on controllable object descriptions. Notably, the proposed pipeline can consistently improve the performance of the recent MLLMs. The code is currently accessible at https://github.com/PRIS-CV/ControllableObjectDescription.},

Our manikindevice aims to assist inexperienced practitioners in mastering an injury assessment technique specifically for the medial collateral ligament (MCL). We designed the manikin collaboratively with a certified clinician. Our design incorporates a commercial human knee joint model for accurate anatomical representation, materials that closely mimic human skin properties, an injury simulation mechanism for replicating MCL injuries, and pressure sensors to capture user-applied pressure during manipulation. We conducted threetwo evaluations: an internal test with our collaborating clinician to configure our manikin for four MCL injury conditions (i.e., healthy, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3) using a psychophysics method; a subsequent study where 6 certified clinicians rated each condition for consistency and a technical evaluation measuring abduction range in the healthy and grade 3 configurations. Results show that our manikin can reliably displaydistinguish between healthy and unhealthy MCLs, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 1.00 for healthy condition, and 1.00 and 0.83, respectively, for the unhealthy condition. However, further improvements are needed to accurately distinguish between injury gradesgrade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 injuries. Our manikin’s realistic weight and shape were highly praised, but there is room for improvement in simulating the skin texture.

We validated the approach with a leave-one-session-out analysis repeated five times and made comparisons to a prosthesis-specific classifier. The dataset was created by merging data from two different prosthesis models (Vanderbilt University, VU, Gen 2 and Gen 3 powered knee-ankle prostheses), for a total of 31 sessions acquired across multiple days from 11 subjects. Subjects performed five locomotion tasks: level walking, incline and decline walking, and stair ascent and descent. Since transitions between different locomotion modes happen at different gait events, the analyses have been repeated for both heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. At HS events, the proposed approach achieves a median f1-score of 99.12% and 92.41% on VU Gen 2 and Gen 3 prostheses respectively. At TO events, the proposed approach reaches a median f1-score of 96.83% with VU Gen 2 and 94.36% with VU Gen 3.

Coaching new exoskeleton users to walk with energetically beneficial gait patterns might accelerate motor learning, but these target patterns have yet to be established. In this study, we characterized changes in gait biomechanics between healthy young adults first exposure to ankle exoskeletons and after 7+ hours of training when they demonstrated full motor adaptation. We observed consistent markers of adaptation in ankle kinematics and spatial gait features; expert exoskeleton users exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion before a powerful and concentrated push-off while walking with narrower and longer steps. Adaptations in muscle coordination patterns were more varied, but generally involved reducing co-contraction throughout the leg. By the end of training, non-propulsive exoskeleton-assisted gait features approached those of unassisted walking. Our results suggest that effective exoskeleton use involves selectively avoiding most disruptions to typical gait while accommodating energetically beneficial changes around push-off. All reported gait features can be monitored and targeted in real-time, facilitating the application of these results to reduce the time burden for novice users to maximally benefit from ankle exoskeletons.},

However, current tuning methods are time-consuming and subjective, relying on trial-and-error, clinician observations, and participant feedback. To improve this process, there is a need to define quantitative relationships between stimulation amplitude and measurable biomechanical metrics. In this study, we present a case series that includes two participants with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury walking with tSCS programmed to provide different stimulation amplitudes. We measured spatiotemporal parameters, electromyography, and inverse kinematics during overground walking with tSCS. Our results indicate that gait speed, stride length, and electromyography outcomes (e.g., muscle coactivation) systematically change with stimulation amplitude. This research is valuable in advancing our understanding of how stimulation amplitude relates to walking biomechanics. In the future, this knowledge will be used to design real-time, adaptive tSCS tuning methods for use in rehabilitation.},

This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 individuals with stroke performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r > 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE (root mean squared error) values ranging from 2∘-5∘ for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3∘ for joint angles, 0.01m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings.

Group fairness refers to the principle that a model’s decisions should be equitable across different groups defined by sensitive attributes such as gender or race, ensuring that individuals from privileged groups and unprivileged groups are treated fairly and receive similar outcomes. However, achieving fairness in the presence of group-specific concept drift remains an unexplored frontier, and our research represents pioneering efforts in this regard. Group-specific concept drift refers to situations where one group experiences concept drift over time, while another does not, leading to a decrease in fairness even if accuracy (ACC) remains fairly stable. Within the framework of federated learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train models, its distributed nature further amplifies these challenges since each client can experience group-specific concept drift independently while still sharing the same underlying concept, creating a complex and dynamic environment for maintaining fairness. The most significant contribution of our research is the formalization and introduction of the problem of group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart, shedding light on its critical importance in the field of fairness. In addition, leveraging insights from prior research, we adapt an existing distributed concept drift adaptation algorithm to tackle group-specific distributed concept drift, which uses a multimodel approach, a local group-specific drift detection mechanism, and continuous clustering of models over time. The findings from our experiments highlight the importance of addressing group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart to advance fairness in machine learning.},

However, most MORL algorithms currently have a limitation in handling the MOMDPs with nonconvex PFs. In this article, we propose a nonlinear MORL algorithm based on decomposition and variance reduction (MORL/D-VR) to overcome this limitation. MORL/D-VR adopts the Tchebycheff approach to transform a given MOMDP into a set of single-objective Markov decision processes (MDPs) and subsequently applies an improved policy gradient algorithm, called expected utility policy gradient (EUPG), to solve each single-objective MDP efficiently. We analyze the Pareto optimality of employing the Tchebycheff approach and policy gradient methods that use the full return to update policy for solving MOMDPs. The analysis shows that such a case can identify any Pareto optimal policy regardless of the shape of PFs theoretically. This can provide a theoretical guarantee for applying the Tchebycheff approach and EUPG in MORL/D-VR to obtain the policies within the nonconvex PFs. Moreover, we devise a new baseline for EUPG to reduce the variance of gradient updates and adopt a weight vector adaptation method to improve diversity. The experimental results show that MORL/D-VR achieves a desirable performance in handling problems with different convex and nonconvex PFs and outperforms current state-of-the-art MORL algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Personalized federated learning (PFL) has become a hot research topic that can learn a personalized learning model for each client. Existing PFL models prefer to aggregate similar clients with similar data distribution to improve the performance of learning models. However, similarity-based PFL methods may exacerbate the class imbalance problem. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic affinity-based PFL (DA-PFL) model to alleviate the class imbalanced problem during federated learning. Specifically, we build an affinity metric from a complementary perspective to guide which clients should be aggregated. We then design a dynamic aggregation strategy that adjusts client aggregation based on the affinity metric in each round, thereby reducing the risk of class imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DA-PFL model can significantly improve the accuracy of each client in four real-world datasets with state-of-the-art comparison methods.},

Unlike the existing iterative learning method with accumulation of control information, the new PID-type AILC avoids control information accumulation in traditional iterative learning control (ILC), maintaining convergence based on error information and confining iteration to parameter estimation, suitable for amplitude- or frequency-limited controllers. Different from the existing approaches of P-type AILC, this work extends ILC advances to PID-type AILC for nonlinear square or nonsquare systems with unknown control gain matrices, enhancing robustness through simultaneous convergence of integral and proportional error terms over a larger range. This analysis method diverges from traditional approaches relying on contraction mappings or asymptotic stability theorems; error convergence is analyzed using inequalities of a composite energy function (CEF). The effectiveness of this work has been validated through two illustrated examples. The results show that compared with P-type AILC, the convergence speed can be increased by approximately two to three times.},

However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives, including data, features, and systems, making privacy-preserving VAD (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, the current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically review the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. In addition, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to the guide future work in the field.},

To effectively adapt to dynamic changes and achieve a fast convergence rate while maintaining good convergence performance, we design a new algorithm called NGTAdam. This algorithm combines the Nesterov acceleration technique with an adaptive moment estimation method. The convergence of NGTAdam is evaluated by evaluating its dynamic regret through the use of linear system inequality. For online convex optimization problems, we provide an upper bound on the dynamic regret of NGTAdam, which depends on the initial conditions and the time-varying nature of the optimization problem. Moreover, we show that if the time-varying part of this upper bound is sublinear with time, the dynamic regret is also sublinear. Through a variety of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that NGTAdam outperforms state-of-the-art distributed online optimization algorithms.},

However, events involved in existing AVEL tasks are usually coarse-grained events. Actually, finer-grained events are sometimes necessary to be distinguished, especially in certain expert-level applications or rich-content-generation studies. However, this is challenging because they are more difficult to detect or distinguish compared with coarse-grained events. To better address this problem, we discuss a new setting of fine-grained AVEL from dataset to method. First, we constructed the first fine-grained audio–visual event dataset, which is called IT-AVE, relying on videos of playing musical instruments, containing 13k video clips and over 52k audio–visual events. All events are labeled from professional music practitioners, and the event categories are all derived from playing techniques, which are fine-grained with little interclass variation. Next, we designed a new fine-grained event localization method, spatial–temporal video event detector (SVED), which focuses on the challenges that fine-grained events are more imperceptible and prone to be disturbed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments based on the proposed IT-AVE dataset versus fine-grained versions of two existing related datasets, including UnAV-22 derived from UnAV-100 and FineAction-AV derived from FineAction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We hope that this work will contribute to the exploration of an integrated understanding of audio–visual videos.},

To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting (GD-DDW) system. The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists’ diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.},

This mainly includes human fuzzy instruction reasoning and the following of physical knowledge. Therefore, the embodied intelligence agent must have the ability to model world knowledge from training data. However, most existing vision and language robot manipulation methods mainly operate in less realistic simulators and language settings and lack explicit modeling of world knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and simple robot manipulation framework, called Surfer. It is based on the world model, treats robot manipulation as a state transfer of the visual scene, and decouples it into two parts: action and scene. Then, the generalization ability of the model on new instructions and new scenes is enhanced by explicit modeling of the action and scene prediction in multimodal information. In addition, we built a robot manipulation simulation platform that supports physics execution based on the MuJoCo physics engine. It can automatically generate demonstration training data and test data, effectively reducing labor costs. To conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the visual-language understanding and physical execution of the manipulation model, we also created a robotic manipulation benchmark with different difficulty levels, called SeaWave. It contains four visual-language manipulation tasks of different difficulty levels and can provide a standardized testing platform for embedded AI agents in multimodal environments. Overall, we hope Surfer can freely surf in the robot’s SeaWave benchmark. Extensive experiments show that Surfer consistently outperforms all baselines significantly in all manipulation tasks. On average, Surfer achieved a success rate of 54.74% on the defined four levels of manipulation tasks, exceeding the best baseline performance of 51.07%.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection has shown potential in various fields, such as finance, aerospace, and security. The fuzzy definition of data anomalies, the complexity of data patterns, and the scarcity of abnormal data samples pose significant challenges to anomaly detection. Researchers have extensively employed autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in studying time series anomaly detection methods. However, relying on reconstruction error, the AE-based anomaly detection algorithm needs more effective regularization methods, rendering it susceptible to the problem of overfitting. Meanwhile, GAN-based anomaly detection algorithms require high-quality training data, significantly impacting their practical deployment. We propose a novel GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure to address these issues. The model first processes the data with the generator to obtain the reconstruction error and then calculates pseudo-labels to divide the data into two categories. One data category is input into the first discriminator, where a minor loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. The other data category is input into the second discriminator, where a larger loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. Through this process, the model can effectively constrain the generator, retaining information on normal data during data reconstruction while discarding information on abnormal data. After conducting experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure achieved good results in anomaly detection, outperforming several advanced methods. Additionally, the model also performed well in practical transformer data.},

This framework integrates the model predictive control (MPC) and offline reinforcement learning (RL) under assumptions of a linear Markov decision process (MDP) with the Koopman operator. KLMOP introduces a fully linearized control framework by learning and modeling the dynamics, reward function, and value function in a latent space through a Koopman-based latent dynamical model (KLDM) and a pessimistic value iteration (PEVI) algorithm. This formulation builds upon the connection between Koopman operator theory and linear MDP. Contrastive learning is employed to ensure the expressiveness and structural conditions of the latent representation in linear MDP, enabling accurate reward prediction and efficient policy optimization. The MPC-based planning policy, then, leverages these components to solve a linear MPC problem efficiently in the latent space. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that KLMOP significantly improves computational efficiency and control performance as compared with existing baseline methods for RM control. This framework provides a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient approach to linearizing nonlinear control problems, and its learning-based design makes it adaptable to broader applications.},

Specifically, ERA employs a multibranched residual network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition. Additionally, a teacher weight integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher’s head weights. Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.},

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning (CIL) offers a promising framework for continuous fault diagnosis (CFD), allowing networks to accumulate knowledge from streaming industrial data and recognize new fault classes. However, current CIL methods assume a balanced data stream, which does not align with the long-tail distribution of fault classes in real industrial scenarios. To fill this gap, this article investigates the impact of long-tail bias in the data stream on the CIL training process through the experimental analysis. Observations show that long-tail bias in the data stream has a cascading effect, affecting the retention of old task knowledge and learning new tasks. Concurrently, the incremental model encounters challenges in identifying samples that conflict with its biases. Accordingly, we propose a CFD method called long-tail CIL via bias calibration (LTCIL-BC), which aims to improve the learning of bias-conflicting samples through bias exploration and debiasing. Specifically, LTCIL-BC simultaneously trains a primary debiased network and an auxiliary biased network. Then, a bias-indicating score is developed to provide insight into model bias and data bias based on the prediction error of the primary and auxiliary models, respectively. LTCIL-BC subsequently adjusts the logits of the debiased network using the bias-indicating score to guide optimization, thereby better utilizing the role of old class exemplars and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on power system (PS) and secure water treatment (SWaT) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LTCIL-BC in CFD, achieving up to 9% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multiple long-tailed CIL setting. Comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTCIL-BC in jointly addressing data and model bias during calibration and prioritizing bias-conflicting samples.},

In this article, we propose a new method called evidential graph contrastive alignment (EGCA) to decouple the blending-target domain and alleviate the effect of noisy target pseudolabels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning (CEL) module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of the same class in the blending-target domain, which alleviates the coexistence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets, and EGCA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.},

  abstract     = {In industrial scenarios, semantic segmentation of surface defects is vital for identifying, localizing, and delineating defects. However, new defect types constantly emerge with product iterations or process updates. Existing defect segmentation models lack incremental learning capabilities, and direct fine-tuning (FT) often leads to catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, low contrast between defects and background, as well as among defect classes, exacerbates this issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a plug-and-play Transformer-based semantic complement module (TSCM). With only a few added parameters, it injects global contextual features from multi-head self-attention into shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps, compensating for convolutional receptive-field limits and fusing global and local information for better segmentation. For incremental updates, we propose multi-scale spatial pooling distillation (MSPD), which uses pseudo-labeling and multi-scale pooling to preserve both short- and long-range spatial relations and provides smooth feature alignment between teacher and student. Additionally, we adopt an adaptive weight fusion (AWF) strategy with a dynamic threshold that assigns higher weights to parameters with larger updates, achieving an optimal balance between stability and plasticity. The experimental results on two industrial surface defect datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in various incremental segmentation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Temporal modeling plays an important role in the effective adaption of the powerful pretrained text–image foundation model into text–video retrieval. However, existing methods often rely on additional heavy trainable modules, such as transformer or BiLSTM, which are inefficient. In contrast, we avoid introducing such heavy components by leveraging frozen foundation models. To this end, we propose temporal modeling with frozen vision–language foundation models (TFVL) to model the temporal dynamics with fixed encoders. Specifically, text encoder temporal modeling (TextTemp) and image encoder temporal modeling (ImageTemp) apply frozen text and image encoders within the video head and video backbone, respectively. TextTemp uses a frozen text encoder to interpret frame representations as “visual words” within a temporal “sentence,” capturing temporal dependencies. On the other hand, ImageTemp uses a frozen image encoder to treat all frame tokens as a unified visual entity, learning spatiotemporal information. The total trainable parameters of our method, comprising a lightweight projection and several prompt tokens, are significantly fewer than those in other existing methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, ActivityNet, and LSMDC. Compared with full fine-tuning on MSR-VTT, our TFVL achieves an average 3.25% gain in R@1 with merely 0.35% of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TFVL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer parameters.},

Traditional imputation methods struggle with such noise due to their black-box nature or lack of adaptability. To address this issue, we recast data imputation as a distribution alignment challenge, utilizing the flexibility of optimal transport (OT) to handle noisy samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Proximal Optimal Transport (POT) problem, where the transportation cost is obtained by the network simplex approach with a selective matching mechanism, which renders it capable of matching distributions with noisy samples. Subsequently, we propose the POT-I framework, where the objective is to minimize the transport cost of POT. The produced gradient is used to refine the imputation value, which achieves missing data imputation (MDI) while getting robustness to noisy samples. Experiments on real-world IIoT datasets demonstrate the superiority of POT-I over state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

In this article, we derive a general trust region for policy optimization methods by considering the effect of subpolicy combinations among agents in multiagent environments. Based on this trust region, we propose an inductive objective to train the policy function, which can ensure agents learn monotonically improving policies. Furthermore, we observe that the policy always updates very weakly before falling into a local optimum. To address this, we introduce a cost regarding policy distance in the inductive objective to strengthen the motivation of agents to explore new policies. This approach strikes a balance during training, where the policy update step size remains within the constraints of the trust region, preventing excessive updates while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. Simulations on wind farm (WF) control tasks and two multiagent benchmarks demonstrate the high performance of the proposed multiagent inductive policy optimization (MAIPO) method.},

  abstract     = {In essence, reinforcement learning (RL) solves optimal control problem (OCP) by employing a neural network (NN) to fit the optimal policy from state to action. The accuracy of policy approximation is often very low in complex control tasks, leading to unsatisfactory control performance compared with online optimal controllers. A primary reason is that the landscape of value function is always not only rugged in most areas but also flat on the bottom, which damages the convergence to the minimum point. To address this issue, we develop a bicriteria policy optimization (BPO) algorithm, which leverages a few optimal demonstration trajectories to guide the policy search at the gradient level. Different from conventional problem definition, BPO seeks to solve a bicriteria OCP, which has two homomorphic objectives: one is from the standard reward signals and the other is to align the demonstration trajectories. We introduce two co-state variables, one for each objectives, and formulate two Hamiltonians for this bicriteria OCP. The resulting new optimality condition preserves the minimum values of both Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that gradient conflict is a key obstacle to simultaneously descending both Hamiltonians, and its impact is negatively proportional to the inner product between the ideal and actual gradients. A minimax optimization problem is built at each RL iteration to minimize conflicts between two homomorphic objectives, whose solution for policy updating is referred to as harmonic gradient. By converting its inner optimization loop into a linear programming with convex trust region constraint, we simplify this problem into a single-loop maximization problem with much increased computational efficiency. Experiment tests on both linear and nonlinear control tasks validate the effectiveness of our BPO algorithm on the accuracy improvement of policy network.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised visible–infrared person reidentification (UVI-ReID) has recently gained great attention due to its potential for enhancing human detection in diverse environments without labeling. Previous methods utilize intramodality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo-labels might be generated in the clustering process and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from the two modalities. In this article, we first conduct a theoretical analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person reidentification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction (PLC) strategy that utilizes a beta mixture model (BMM) to predict the probability of misclustering-based network’s memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment (MLA) strategy that generates paired visible–infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity-discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.},

While recent research has made strides in this area, the issue of when agents should maintain consistent behaviors with one another is still not adequately addressed. This article proposes a novel approach to enable agents to autonomously decide whether their behaviors should align with those of their peers by leveraging intrinsic rewards to optimize their policies. We define behavior consistency as the divergence between the actions taken by two agents given the same observations. To encourage agents to be aware of each other’s behaviors, we propose dynamic consistency-based intrinsic reward (DCIR), which guides agents in determining when to synchronize their behaviors. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scaling network (DSN) that provides learnable scaling factors at each time step, enabling agents to dynamically decide the extent of rewarding consistent behavior. Our method is evaluated on environments including Multiagent Particle, Google Research Football, and StarCraft II Micromanagement.

First, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to each user and item. Second, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as ”implicit feedback”). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items that users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which, to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for autoencoders in a Recommender systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.},

However, representative studies only evaluated SNNs on static temporal tasks or short sequence tasks, which could not fully demonstrate the advantages of SNNs in spatiotemporal learning. In addition, we point out that the existing directly trained SNNs to face the problems of long-term memory, network degeneration, gradient saturation, and heterogeneity learning, these limit the performance of SNNs. In this article, we propose channelwise regional integrate and multiple firing (CRIMF) neuron to improve the spatiotemporal learning of SNNs. First, CRIMF neuron contains a new internal state of regional current that enhances the memory of spiking neurons and facilitates the learning of temporal information over long time steps. Second, CRIMF neuron is implemented with the multiple firing mechanisms; it is able to adjust the distribution of membrane potential and membrane potential gradient in the single firing mechanism, thus mitigating the underactivation and gradient saturation. Third, CRIMF neuron is trained with the channelwise learning strategy for the targeted learning of different types of temporal features, and an index of differentiation degree is proposed to visualize the effectiveness of the channelwise learning strategy. We also introduce the regional current reset equation and normalize the input of postsynaptic neurons in spatiotemporal dimension to avoid network degeneration. Finally, we select two emotion electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and perform the evaluations based on manual features and raw signals. Experimental results show that CRIMF-based SNNs outperform the state-of-the-art methods in static temporal task, and CRIMF neurons are superior to the advanced spiking neurons and recurrent units of ANNs in dynamic temporal task, using low energy consumption.},

Integrating these interfaces with computer vision techniques, which possess efficient feature extraction capabilities, can achieve more robust and accurate detection of dim targets in aerial images. However, existing target detection methods primarily concentrate on homogeneous data, lacking efficient and versatile processing capabilities for heterogeneous multimodal data. In this article, we first build a brain–eye–computer-based object detection system for aerial images under few-shot conditions. This system detects suspicious targets using region proposal networks (RPNs), evokes the event-related potential (ERP) signal in electroencephalogram (EEG) through the eye-tracking-based slow serial visual presentation (ESSVP) paradigm, and constructs the EEG–image data pairs with eye movement data. Then, an adaptive modality balanced online knowledge distillation (AMBOKD) method is proposed to recognize dim objects with the EEG–image data. AMBOKD fuses EEG and image features using a multihead attention module, establishing a new modality with comprehensive features. To enhance the performance and robust capability of the fusion modality, simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities are enabled by end-to-end online KD (OKD). During the learning process, an adaptive modality balancing module is proposed to ensure multimodal equilibrium by dynamically adjusting the weights of the importance and the training gradients across various modalities. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are demonstrated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, experiments conducted on public datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate the reliability and practicality of the proposed system and the designed method.

Linear attention reduces this complexity from quadratic to linear, offering a strong computation–performance tradeoff. To further optimize this, automatic pruning is an effective method to find a structure that maximizes performance within a target resource through training without any heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multihead attention is not straightforward due to channel mismatch. In this article, we propose an automatic pruning method to deal with this problem. Different from existing methods that rely solely on training without any prior knowledge, we integrate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve the more informative channels within each head. Then, we adjust the pruning indicator to enforce that channels are removed evenly across all heads, thereby avoiding any channel mismatch. We incorporate a reweight module to mitigate information loss due to channel removal and introduce an effective pruning indicator initialization for linear attention, based on the attention differences between the original structure and each channel. By applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer on ImageNet-1K, which incorporates original and linear attention mechanisms, we achieve a 30% reduction of FLOPs in a near lossless manner. It also has 1.96% of accuracy gain over the DeiT-B model while reducing FLOPs by 37%, and 1.05% accuracy increase over the Swin-B model with a 10% reduction in FLOPs as well.

  abstract     = {This article advances the theoretical foundations of stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) by rigorously analyzing their convergence properties, approximation guarantees, and the limitations of nonadaptive randomized methods. We introduce a principled objective function that aligns incremental training with orthogonal projection, ensuring maximal residual reduction at each iteration without recomputing output weights. Under this formulation, we derive a novel necessary and sufficient condition for strong convergence in Hilbert spaces and establish sufficient conditions for uniform geometric convergence, offering the first theoretical justification of the SCN residual constraint. To assess the feasibility of unguided random initialization, we present a probabilistic analysis showing that even small support shifts markedly reduce the likelihood of sampling effective nodes in high-dimensional settings, thereby highlighting the necessity of adaptive refinement in the sampling distribution. Motivated by these insights, we propose greedy SCNs (GSCNs) and two optimized variants—Newton–Raphson GSCN (NR-GSCN) and particle swarm optimization GSCN (PSO-GSCN)—that incorporate Newton–Raphson refinement and particle swarm-based exploration to improve node selection. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve faster convergence, better approximation accuracy, and more compact architectures compared to existing SCN training schemes. Collectively, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical and algorithmic framework for SCNs, laying out a principled foundation for subsequent developments in the field of randomized neural network (NN) training.},

  abstract     = {Matrix factorization (MF) is a fundamental problem in machine learning, which is usually used as a feature learning method in various fields. For complex data involving spatiotemporal interactions, MF that only handles 2-D data will disrupt spatial dependence or temporal dynamics, failing to effectively couple spatial information with temporal factors. According to Markov chain principle, the spatial information of the present time is related to the spatial state of the previous time. We propose a spatial–temporal diffusion model for MF (STDMF), which uses graph diffusion to couple spatial–temporal information. Then, MF is used to learn the joint feature of data and spatial–temporal diffusion graph. Specifically, STDMF utilizes the graph diffusion with physical laws to generate spatial–temporal structure information. It obtains the underlying core structure of complex systems from a global perspective, which enhances the generalization ability of MF in noisy time-series data. To learn the lowest rank subspace of MF in time-series data, STDMF uses structural learning to constrain the rank of the learned features. Finally, STDMF is applied to clustering and anomaly detection of dynamic graph. The effectiveness of this method is verified by sufficient experiments, especially for noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks, especially recent diffusion-based models, have shown remarkable superiority in gaming, control, and QA systems, where the training tasks’ datasets are usually static. However, in real-world applications, such as robotic control of reinforcement learning (RL), the tasks are changing, and new tasks arise in a sequential order. This situation poses the new challenge of plasticity–stability tradeoff for training an agent who can adapt to task changes and retain acquired knowledge. In view of this, we propose a rehearsal-based continual diffusion model, called continual diffuser (CoD), to endow the diffuser with the capabilities of quick adaptation (plasticity) and lasting retention (stability). Specifically, we first construct an offline benchmark that contains 90 tasks from multiple domains. Then, we train the CoD on each task with sequential modeling and conditional generation for making decisions. Next, we preserve a small portion of previous datasets as the rehearsal buffer and replay it to retain the acquired knowledge. Extensive experiments on a series of tasks show that CoD can achieve a promising plasticity–stability tradeoff and outperform existing diffusion-based methods and other representative baselines on most tasks.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models, as a class of generative frameworks based on step-wise denoising, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of medical image segmentation. However, existing diffusion-based methods typically rely on static fusion strategies to integrate conditional priors with denoised features, making them difficult to adaptively balance their respective contributions at different denoising stages. Moreover, these methods often lack explicit modeling of pixel-level uncertainty in ambiguous regions, which may lead to the loss of structural details during the iterative denoising process, ultimately compromising the accuracy (Acc) and completeness of the final segmentation results. To this end, we propose FEU-Diff, a diffusion-based segmentation framework that integrates fuzzy evidence modeling and uncertainty fusion (UF) mechanisms. Specifically, a fuzzy semantic enhancement (FSE) module is designed to model pixel-level uncertainty through Gaussian membership functions and fuzzy logic rules, enhancing the model’s ability to identify and represent ambiguous boundaries. An evidence dynamic fusion (EDF) module estimates feature confidence via a Dirichlet-based distribution and adaptively guides the fusion of conditional information and denoised features across different denoising stages. Furthermore, the UF module quantifies discrepancies among multisource predictions to compensate for structural detail loss during the iterative denoising process. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that FEU-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving an average gain of 1.42% in the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 1.47% in intersection over union (IoU), and a 2.26 mm reduction in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). In addition, our method generates uncertainty maps that enhance clinical interpretability.},

Herein, the peak-padding clustering algorithm (PeakPad)—clustering by padding density peaks with the minimum padding cost—is proposed. PeakPad executes clustering on the density surface and views complex-shaped clusters as combinations of highly associated single-peak clusters. The minimum padding cost that fully considers the surrounding context of a density peak is proposed to reflect a density peak’s center potential, enabling PeakPad to have robust center detection performance. Unlike mean-shift (MSC), which detects centers based on their attributes in a complex-shaped density surface embedded in the high-dimensional space of density and features, PeakPad detects centers in a standard-shaped surface embedded in the 2-D density-change (DC) density space (composed of density and DC feature). Such standardization allows PeakPad to have fast and robust cluster center detection performance on complex-shaped clusters based on the minimum padding cost. Besides, PeakPad can provide a reasonable evaluation of the association between single-peak clusters by using the minimum padding cost. As a result, PeakPad can fast capture complex-shaped clusters, achieve robust center detection performance, and be suitable for large datasets. Benchmark test results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PeakPad.},

In order to bridge this gap, we present unsupervised-semi-supervised stacking (USemiS), a novel framework that synergizes semi-supervised learning with ensemble meta-learning. USemiS introduces three core innovations: 1) unsupervised component learners that extract low-level representations of heterogeneous anomalies, 2) a consensus-based tuning mechanism that dynamically weights robust learners via stability metrics, and 3) spatiotemporal MixUp (ST-MixUp), a tailored augmentation strategy that interpolates anomalies across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance decision boundaries. By integrating these components, USemiS effectively disentangles latent anomaly patterns while mitigating label scarcity. Evaluated on large-scale traffic anomaly and crowd fall detection datasets, USemiS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 1.3% and 2.1% in AUC under extreme low-label regimes (0.4% and 0.8% labeled data, respectively). These results underscore USemiS’s capacity to generalize across diverse spatiotemporal contexts, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world applications where labeled anomalies are scarce yet critical.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the action-region tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling distinguishing similar actions effectively. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics serve as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are then organized into action tracklets, which characterize the region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across different video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries are designed to expressly encode nuanced semantic representations derived from the textual descriptions of action labels, as extracted by the language branches within visual language models. To optimize generated action tracklets, we design a multilevel tracklet contrastive constraint among multiple region responses at spatial and temporal levels, which can effectively distinguish individual region responses in each video frame (spatial level) and establish the correlation of similar region responses between adjacent video frames (temporal level). In addition, we implement a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism to refine textual semantics during training. This ensures that the semantic representations encoded by vision language models (VLMs) are not only preserved but also optimized for specific task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on several widely used action recognition benchmarks, i.e., FineGym, Diving48, NTURGB-D, Kinetics, and Something-Something, clearly demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, in few-shot scenarios, its effectiveness is limited by sensitivity to the initialization and the time-consuming search for optimal initialization, hindering rapid adaptation. Additionally, prompt tuning risks reducing the models' generalizability due to overfitting on scarce training samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Gradient-RegulAted Meta-prompt learning (GRAM) framework that jointly meta-learns an efficient soft prompt initialization for better adaptation and a lightweight gradient regulating function for strong cross-domain generalizability in a meta-learning paradigm using only the weakly labeled image-text pre-training data. This is achieved through a Cross-Modal Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that organizes extensive image-text data into a structured hierarchy, facilitating robust meta-learning across diverse domains. Rather than designing a specific prompt tuning method, our GRAM can be easily incorporated into various prompt tuning methods in a model-agnostic way and bring about consistent improvement for them. Further, we consider a more practical but challenging setting: test-time prompt tuning with only unlabeled test samples and propose an improved structure-induced gradient regulating function to leverage the structured semantics of the meta-learning data for zero-shot generalization. This novel approach exploits the hierarchically clustered meta-learning data to model relationships between test-time data and meta-learning prototypes, facilitating the transfer of invariant knowledge without explicit annotations. Meanwhile, we introduce a structure complexity-informed strategy for adaptively constructing meta-training tasks and generating prototypes, which fully considers the diverse semantics within hierarchical clusters of different complexities.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.},

However, standard DA produces synthetic data for augmentation with limited diversity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may unlock additional information in a dataset by generating synthetic samples having the appearance of real images. However, these models struggle to simultaneously address three key requirements: fidelity and high-quality samples; diversity and mode coverage; and fast sampling. Indeed, GANs generate high-quality samples rapidly, but have poor mode coverage, limiting their adoption in DA applications. We propose LatentAugment, a DA strategy that overcomes the low diversity of GANs, opening up for use in DA applications. Without external supervision, LatentAugment modifies latent vectors and moves them into latent space regions to maximise the synthetic images' diversity and fidelity. It is also agnostic to the dataset and the downstream task. A wide set of experiments shows that LatentAugment improves the generalisation of a deep model translating from MRI-to-CT beating both standard DA as well GAN-based sampling. We further demonstrate its effectiveness when translating from low-energy mammograms to dual-energy subtracted images in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography. Moreover, still in comparison with GAN-based sampling, LatentAugment synthetic samples show superior mode coverage and diversity. Code is available at: https://github.com/ltronchin/LatentAugment.},

  abstract     = {The troublesome model size and quadratic computational complexity associated with token quantity pose significant deployment challenges for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in practical applications. Despite recent advancements in model pruning and token reduction techniques speed up the inference speed of ViTs, these approaches either adopt a fixed sparsity ratio or overlook the meaningful interplay between architectural optimization and token selection. Consequently, this static and single-dimension compression often leads to pronounced accuracy degradation under aggressive compression rates, as they fail to fully explore redundancies across these two orthogonal dimensions. Therefore, we introduce PRANCE, a framework which can jointly optimize activated channels and tokens on a per-sample basis, aiming to accelerate ViTs' inference process from a unified data and architectural perspective. However, the joint framework poses challenges to both architectural and decision-making aspects. Firstly, while ViTs inherently support variable-token inference, they do not facilitate dynamic computations for variable channels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a meta-network using weight-sharing techniques to support arbitrary channels of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, serving as a foundational model for architectural decision-making. Secondly, simultaneously optimizing the model structure and input data constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large decision space, reaching up to around $10^{14}$, making supervised learning infeasible. To this end, we design a lightweight selector employing Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) for efficient decision-making. Furthermore, we introduce a novel “Result-to-Go” training mechanism that models ViTs' inference process as a Markov decision process, significantly reducing action space and mitigating delayed-reward issues during training. Additionally, our framework simultaneously supports different kinds of token optimization methods such as pruning, merging, and sequential pruning-merging strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRANCE in reducing FLOPs by approximately 50%, retaining only about 10% of tokens while achieving lossless Top-1 accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of personal devices, there are abundant valuable face image datasets in the industry, which provides opportunities for the development of visual models. However, privacy concerns related to identity sensitive information hinder face datasets sharing. Despite existing works dedicated to removing identity sensitive information from images, they either lack provable privacy guarantees or compromise crucial face dataset utilities, e.g., identity correlation and image naturalness. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a novel face dataset publication scheme that protects face images by obfuscating face features. The obfuscated features still retain a certain level of correlation, allowing the protected dataset to be used for training. In the process of obfuscating the features, we design a novel metric differential privacy mechanism, which can enhance the correlation between features while ensuring privacy. Furthermore, we construct a latent diffusion model with identity and attribute as inputs to improve the naturalness of generated images. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate our scheme significantly outperforms existing works in providing privacy protection while maintaining high dataset utility for downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.},

Conventional EBS centroiding methods assume the generated events follow a Gaussian distribution and require long event streams ($\gt 1$s) for accurate localization. However, these assumptions are inadequate for centroiding unresolved objects, since the EBS circuitry causes non-Gaussian event distributions, and because using long event streams negates the low-latency advantage of EBS. In this work, we derive a closed-form spatiotemporal event distribution that accounts for these non-Gaussian effects and relaxes the long-time window requirement. Using Fisher analysis, we show that the spatial distribution of events in short time windows ($\leq 20$ ms) contains sufficient information for accurately estimating both position and velocity. To validate our analysis, we create the first EBS dataset of unresolved point-objects with subpixel ground truth using a high-speed monitor. We demonstrate that a small LSTM network can estimate an object's position within 1pixel and velocity within $\pm 17\%$ using only 5ms of event data, outperforming traditional approaches. These improvements enable accurate and quick centroiding of fast and dim objects, and we publish all code and data to support future research.},

Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various evaluation metrics.

Although SK has achieved substantial success in various engineering applications, its intrinsic modeling strategy by focusing on the sample mean limits its flexibility and capability of predicting individual functional samples. Moreover, the performance of SK can be impaired under scarce data scenarios, which are commonly encountered in engineering applications, especially for start-up or just deployed systems. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework to address the challenges of individualization and data scarcity in traditional SK. The proposed framework features a within-process model to facilitate individualized prediction and a between-process model to leverage information from related processes for resolving the issue of data scarcity. The within- and between-process models are integrated through a tailored convolution process, which quantifies interactions within and between processes using a specially designed covariance matrix and corresponding kernel parameters. Statistical properties are investigated on the parameter estimation of the proposed framework, which provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of transfer learning. The proposed method is compared with benchmark methods through various numerical and real case studies, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in dealing with individualized prediction of functional responses, especially when limited data are available in the process of interest.},

To address these issues, we first propose the model-agnostic multi-relation detection task, which incorporates relation information into text encoding to generate the relation-aware semantics. Then we propose the model-agnostic multi-relation supervised contrastive learning, which leverages the relation-derived inter-sample dependencies as a supervised signal to learn discriminative semantics via drawing together or pushing away the sentence-level semantics regarding whether they share the same/similar relations. Besides, we design the reverse label frequency weighting and hierarchical label embedding mechanisms to alleviate label imbalance and integrate relation hierarchy. Our method can be applied to any RTE model and we conduct extensive experiments on five backbones by augmenting them with our method. Experimental results on four public benchmarks show that our method can bring significant and consistent improvements to various backbones and model analysis further verify the effectiveness of our method.},

In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

However, as models and datasets rapidly scale up in practical applications, it is crucial to consider the applicability of existing KD approaches originally designed for limited-capacity architectures and small-scale datasets. In this paper, we revisit current KD methods and identify the presence of a small-data pitfall, where most modifications to vanilla KD prove ineffective on large-scale datasets. To guide the design of consistently effective KD methods across different data scales, we conduct a meticulous evaluation of the knowledge transfer process. Our findings reveal that incorporating more useful information is crucial for achieving consistently effective KD methods, while modifications in loss functions show relatively less significance. In light of this, we present a paradigmatic example that combines vanilla KD with deep supervision, incorporating additional information into the student during distillation. This approach surpasses almost all recent KD methods.

  abstract     = {Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of annotated data, where meticulous pixel-level annotation is both labor-intensive and costly, primarily due to the intricate object-background boundaries. Addressing the core question, ”Can COS be effectively achieved in a zero-shot manner without manual annotations for any camouflaged object?”, we propose an affirmative solution. We analyze the learned attention patterns for camouflaged objects and introduce a robust zero-shot COS framework. Our findings reveal that while transformer models for salient object segmentation (SOS) prioritize global features in their attention mechanisms, camouflaged object segmentation exhibits both global and local attention biases. Based on these findings, we design a framework that adapts with the inherent local pattern bias of COS while incorporating global attention patterns and a broad semantic feature space derived from SOS. This enables efficient zero-shot transfer for COS. Specifically, We incorporate an Masked Image Modeling (MIM) based image encoder optimized for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a Multimodal Large Language Model (M-LLM), and a Multi-scale Fine-grained Alignment (MFA) mechanism. The MIM encoder captures essential local features, while the PEFT module learns global and semantic representations from SOS datasets. To further enhance semantic granularity, we leverage the M-LLM to generate caption embeddings conditioned on visual cues, which are meticulously aligned with multi-scale visual features via MFA. This alignment enables precise interpretation of complex semantic contexts. Moreover, we introduce a learnable codebook to represent the M-LLM during inference, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining performance. Our framework demonstrates its versatility and efficacy through rigorous experimentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot COS with $F_{\beta }^{w}$ scores of 72.9% on CAMO and 71.7% on COD10K. By removing the M-LLM during inference, we achieve an inference speed comparable to that of traditional end-to-end models, reaching 18.1 FPS. Additionally, our method excels in polyp segmentation, and underwater scene segmentation, outperforming challenging baselines in both zero-shot and supervised settings, thereby highlighting its potential for broad applicability in diverse segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H2OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H2OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H2OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Designing expressive hypergraph kernels that can effectively capture high-order structural information is a fundamental challenge in hypergraph learning. In this paper, we propose a novel comparison framework based on hypergraph homomorphisms to evaluate and compare the expressive ability of existing hypergraph kernels. We revisit classical kernels such as Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (HG WL) and Hypergraph Rooted kernels, providing theoretical conditions under which they fail to distinguish non-isomorphic hypergraphs. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the Hypergraph Subtree-Cycle Kernel, which augments subtree-based features with cycle-based structural patterns to enhance expressiveness. We propose two variants: HG SCKernelv1 and HG SCKernelv2. Extensive experiments on five graph and ten hypergraph classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our methods, confirming the effectiveness of integrating homomorphism-guided design into hypergraph kernels.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal information extraction (IE) tasks have attracted increasing attention because many studies have shown that multimodal information benefits text information extraction. However, existing multimodal IE datasets mainly focus on sentence-level image-facilitated IE in English text, and pay little attention to video-based multimodal IE and fine-grained visual grounding. Therefore, in order to promote the development of multimodal IE, we constructed a multimodal multilingual multitask dataset, named M3D, which has the following features: (1) It contains paired document-level text and video to enrich multimodal information; (2) It supports two widely-used languages, namely English and Chinese; (3) It includes more multimodal IE tasks such as entity recognition, entity chain extraction, relation extraction and visual grounding. In addition, our dataset introduces an unexplored theme, i.e., biography, enriching the domains of multimodal IE resources. To establish a benchmark for our dataset, we propose an innovative hierarchical multimodal IE model. This model effectively leverages and integrates multimodal information through a Denoised Feature Fusion Module (DFFM). Furthermore, in non-ideal scenarios, modal information is often incomplete. Thus, we designed a Missing Modality Construction Module (MMCM) to alleviate the issues caused by missing modalities. Our model achieved an average performance of 53.80% and 53.77% on four tasks in English and Chinese datasets, respectively, which set a reasonable standard for subsequent research. In addition, we conducted more analytical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed module. We believe that our work can promote the development of the field of multimodal IE.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent imbalance in real-world datasets, naïve Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tends to bias the learning process towards the majority classes, hindering generalization to minority classes. To rebalance the learning process, one straightforward yet effective approach is to modify the loss function via class-dependent terms, such as re-weighting and logit-adjustment. However, existing analysis of these loss-oriented methods remains coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. After reviewing prior work, we find that the properties used through their analysis are typically global, i.e., defined over the whole dataset. Hence, these properties fail to effectively capture how class-dependent terms influence the learning process. To bridge this gap, we turn to explore the localized versions of such properties i.e., defined within each class. Specifically, we employ localized calibration to provide consistency validation across a broader range of losses and localized Lipschitz continuity to provide a fine-grained generalization bound. In this way, we reach a unified perspective for improving and adjusting loss-oriented methods. Finally, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on these insights. Empirical results on both traditional ResNets and foundation models validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.},

This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator, MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors, showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range detection scenarios.},

Due to nuisances such as limited overlap and noise, initial correspondences often contain a large number of outliers, imposing a great challenge to downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel single voter spreading (SVOS) method for efficient 3D correspondence grouping and 3D registration. Our core insight is to leverage low-order graph constraints only in a single voter spreading voting scheme to achieve comparable constrain-ability as complex constraints without searching them. First, a simple first-order graph is constructed for the initial correspondence set. Second, a two-stage voting method is proposed, including single voter voting and spread voters voting. Each voting stage involves both local and global voting via edge constraints only. This promises good selectivity while making the voting process time- and storage-efficient. Finally, top-scored correspondences are opted for robust transformation estimation. Experiments on U3M, 3DMatch/3DLoMatch, ETH, and KITTI-LC datasets verify that SVOS achieves new state-of-the-art correspondence grouping and registration performance, while being light-weight and robust to graph construction parameters.

Existing fusion methods achieving complementary context aggregation predominantly rely on hand-crafted fusion rules and sophisticated loss functions, which introduce subjectivity and often fail to adapt to complex real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Mask-DiFuser, a novel fusion paradigm that ingeniously transforms the unsupervised image fusion task into a dual masked image reconstruction task by incorporating masked image modeling with a diffusion model, overcoming various issues arising from the absence of GT. In particular, we devise a dual masking scheme to simulate complementary information and employ a diffusion model to restore source images from two masked inputs, thereby aggregating complementary contexts. A content encoder with an attention parallel feature mixer is deployed to extract and integrate complementary features, offering local content guidance. Moreover, a semantic encoder is developed to supply global context which is integrated into the diffusion model via a cross-attention mechanism. During inference, Mask-DiFuser begins with a Gaussian distribution and iteratively denoises it conditioned on multi-source images to directly generate fused images. The masked diffusion model, learning priors from high-quality natural images, ensures that fusion results align more closely with human visual perception. Extensive experiments on several fusion tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion, demonstrate that Mask-DiFuser significantly outshines SOTA fusion alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a fundamental task that aims at assigning a category label to each pixel. To pursue precise segmentation with one or more fine-grained categories, semantic segmentation often requires holistic segmentation of whole-scene RSI (WRI), which is normally characterized by a large size. However, conventional deep learning methods struggle to handle holistic segmentation of WRI due to the memory limitations of the graphics processing unit (GPU), thus requiring to adopt suboptimal strategies such as cropping or fusion, which result in performance degradation. Here, we introduce the Robust End-to-end semantic Segmentation architecture for whole-scene remoTe sensing imagery (REST). REST is the first intrinsically end-to-end framework for truly holistic segmentation of WRI, supporting a wide range of encoders and decoders in a plug-and-play fashion. It enables seamless integration with mainstream semantic segmentation methods, and even more advanced foundation models. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial parallel interaction mechanism (SPIM) within REST to overcome GPU memory constraints and achieve global context awareness. Unlike traditional parallel methods, SPIM enables REST to process a WRI effectively and efficiently by combining parallel computation with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that REST attains near-linear throughput scalability as additional GPUs are employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REST consistently outperforms existing cropping-based and fusion-based methods across a variety of scenarios, ranging from single-class to multi-class segmentation, from multispectral to hyperspectral imagery, and from satellite to drone platforms. The robustness and versatility of REST are expected to offer a promising solution for the holistic segmentation of WRI, with the potential for further extension to large-size medical imagery segmentation.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in 3D content generation have shown remarkable success by leveraging pretrained large-scale diffusion models. However, existing 3D generation results are far from perfect as one primary challenge lies in aligning 3D content with human preference, especially in text-driven 3D generation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generation framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-driven 3D generation models from human preference feedback. First, we collect 25K+ expert comparisons based on a systematic annotation pipeline including filtering, rating, and ranking. Then, we build Reward3D, the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model to encode human preferences effectively. Building upon the 3D reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D Feedback Learning (DreamFL) algorithm to guide the noisy pretrained distribution toward the actual user-prompt distributions in optimization. With the rapid development and growing popularity of 4D and image-driven 3D generation, we further extend our DreamReward into 4D generation (DreamReward-4D) and image-to-3D generation (DreamReward-img) in a low-cost but effective manner. Despite the impressive results created by DreamReward, the diversity in text-driven 3D generation is limited due to inherent maximum likelihood-seeking issues. To address this, we explore the gap between Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and SDS-based DreamFL in the generation process and propose DreamReward++, where we introduce a reward-aware noise sampling strategy to unleash text-driven diversity during the generation process while ensuring human preference alignment. Grounded by theoretical proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our method successfully generates high-fidelity and diverse 3D results with significant boosts in prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great potential for learning from human feedback to improve 3D generation.},

Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. We also design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate the synthetic data of ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods.

  abstract     = {Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

However, when it is extended to federated learning systems, many issues may arise, including (i) mega-batch size settings; (ii) additional noise introduced by the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point; and (iii) gradient (statistical) heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight algorithm termed federated adaptive batch size time evolving variance reduction (FedATEVR) to tackle these issues, consisting of an adaptive batch size setting scheme and a time-evolving variance reduction gradient estimator. In particular, we use the historical gradient information to set an appropriate mega-batch size for each client, which can steadily accelerate the local SGD process and reduce the computation cost. The historical information involves both global and local gradient, which mitigates unstable varying in mega-batch size introduced by gradient heterogeneity among the clients. For each client, the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point is used to tune the time-evolving weight of the variance reduction term in the gradient estimator. This can avoid meaningless variance reduction caused by the out-of-date snapshot point gradient. We theoretically prove that our algorithm can achieve a linear speedup of of $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{SKT}})$ for non-convex objective functions under partial client participation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve higher test accuracy than the baselines and decrease communication rounds greatly.},

  abstract     = {Today, convolutional neural network (CNN) pruning techniques often rely on manually crafted importance criteria and pruning structures. Due to their heuristic nature, these methods may lack generality, and their performance is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to address this challenge by leveraging the concept of $\gamma$-weak submodularity, based on a new efficient importance function. By deriving an upper bound on the absolute error in the layer subsequent to the pruned layer, we formulate the importance function as a $\gamma$-weakly submodular function. This formulation enables the development of an easy-to-implement, low-complexity, and data-free oblivious algorithm for selecting filters to be removed from a convolutional layer. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark networks across various datasets, with a computational cost comparable to the simplest pruning techniques, such as $l_{2}$-norm pruning. Notably, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 76.52%, compared to 75.15% for the overall best baseline, with a 25.5% reduction in network parameters. According to our proposed resource-efficiency metric for pruning methods, the ACLI approach demonstrates orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency than the other baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy.},

Although many transfer attacks have been proposed, existing research lacks a systematic and comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we systemize transfer attacks into five categories around the general machine learning pipeline and provide the first comprehensive evaluation, with 23 representative attacks against 11 representative defenses, including the recent, transfer-oriented defense and the real-world Google Cloud Vision. In particular, we identify two main problems of existing evaluations: (1) for attack transferability, lack of intra-category analyses with fair hyperparameter settings, and (2) for attack stealthiness, lack of diverse measures. Our evaluation results validate that these problems have indeed caused misleading conclusions and missing points, and addressing them leads to new, consensuschallenging insights, such as (1) an early attack, DI, even outperforms all similar follow-up ones, (2) the state-of-the-art (whitebox) defense, DiffPure, is even vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks, and (3) even under the same Lp constraint, different attacks yield dramatically different stealthiness results regarding diverse imperceptibility metrics, finer-grained measures, and a user study.

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning (MTL) is a standard learning paradigm in machine learning. The central idea of MTL is to capture the shared knowledge among multiple tasks for mitigating the problem of data sparsity where the annotated samples for each task are quite limited. Recent studies indicate that graph multi-task learning (GMTL) yields the promising improvement over previous MTL methods. GMTL represents tasks on a task relation graph, and further leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex task relationships. Although GMTL achieves the better performance, the construction of task relation graph heavily depends on simple heuristic tricks, which results in the existence of spurious task correlations and the absence of true edges between tasks with strong connections. This problem largely limits the effectiveness of GMTL. To this end, we propose the Generative Causality-driven Network (GCNet), a novel framework that progressively learns the causal structure between tasks to discover which tasks are beneficial to be jointly trained for improving generalization ability and model robustness. To be specific, in the feature space, GCNet first introduces a feature-level generator to generate the structure prior for reducing learning difficulty. Afterwards, GCNet develops a output-level generator which is parameterized as a new causal energy-based model (EBM) to refine the learned structure prior in the output space driven by causality. Benefiting from our proposed causal framework, we theoretically derive an intervention contrastive estimation for training this causal EBM efficiently. Experiments are conducted on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensive empirical results and model analyses demonstrate the superior performance of GCNet over several competitive MTL baselines.},

  abstract     = {Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop training strategies in the source domain to enhance model transferability, face challenges when applied to large-scale pre-trained models (LMs), as their source domains and training strategies are not accessible. Besides, fine-tuning LMs specifically for CDFSL requires substantial computational resources, which limits their practicality. Therefore, this paper investigates the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem to solve the few-shot learning (FSL) task in target domain using only a pre-trained model and a few target samples, without requiring source data or training strategies. However, the inaccessibility of source data prevents explicitly reducing the domain gaps between the source and target. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach, Step-wise Distribution-aligned Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), to implicitly narrow the domain gaps from the perspective of prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT initially proposes a style prompt that adjusts the target samples to mirror the expected distribution. Furthermore, StepSPT tunes the style prompt and classifier by exploring a dual-phase optimization process (external and internal processes). In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy is introduced to tune the proposed style prompt by factorizing the prediction distribution optimization problem into the multi-step distribution alignment problem. In the internal process, the classifier is updated via standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluation on 5 datasets illustrates the superiority of StepSPT over existing prompt tuning-based methods and state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs). Furthermore, ablation studies and performance analyzes highlight the efficacy of StepSPT. The code will be made public at https://github.com/xuhuali-mxj/StepSPT.},

  abstract     = {Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT's superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of W3A3 ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%. Our code is available at https://github.com/zysxmu/IaS-ViT.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral filter array (MSFA) camera is increasingly used due to its compact size and fast capturing speed. However, because of its narrow-band property, it often suffers from the light-deficient problem, and images captured are easily overwhelmed by noise. As a type of commonly used denoising method, neural networks have shown their power to achieve satisfactory denoising results. However, their performance highly depends on high-quality noisy-clean image pairs. For the task of MSFA image denoising, there is currently neither a paired real dataset nor an accurate noise model capable of generating realistic noisy images. To this end, we present a physics-based noise model that is capable to match the real noise distribution and synthesize realistic noisy images. In our noise model, those different types of noise can be divided into SimpleDist component and ComplexDist component. The former contains all the types of noise that can be described using a simple probability distribution like Gaussian or Poisson distribution, and the latter contains the complicated color bias noise that cannot be modeled using a simple probability distribution. Besides, we design a noise-decoupled network consisting of a SimpleDist noise removal network (SNRNet) and a ComplexDist noise removal network (CNRNet) to sequentially remove each component. Moreover, according to the non-uniformity of color bias noise in our noise model, we introduce a learnable position embedding in CNRNet to indicate the position information. To verify the effectiveness of our physics-based noise model and noise-decoupled network, we collect a real MSFA denoising dataset with paired long-exposure clean images and short-exposure noisy images. Experiments are conducted to prove that the network trained using synthetic data generated by our noise model performs as well as trained using paired real data, and our noise-decoupled network outperforms other state-of-the-art denoising methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose to address monocular 3D hand pose estimation from a single RGB or depth image via articulated anchor-to-joint 3D local regressors, in form of A2J-Transformer+. The key idea is to make the local regressors (i.e., anchor points) in 3D space be aware of hand's local fine details and global articulated context jointly, to facilitate predicting their 3D offsets toward hand joints with linear weighted aggregation for joint localization. Our intuition is that, local fine details help to estimate accurate offset but may suffer from the issues including serious occlusion, confusing similar patterns, and overfitting risk. On the other hand, hand's global articulated context can essentially provide additional descriptive clues and constraints to alleviate these issues. To set anchor points adaptively in 3D space, A2J-Transformer+ runs in a 2-stage manner. At the first stage, since the input modality property anchor points distribute more densely on X-Y plane, it leads to lower prediction accuracy along Z direction compared with those in the X and Y directions. To alleviate this, at the second stage anchor points are set near the joints yielded by the first stage evenly along X, Y, and Z directions. This treatment brings two main advantages: (1) balancing the prediction accuracy along X, Y, and Z directions, and (2) ensuring the anchor-joint offsets are of small values relatively easy to estimate. Wide-range experiments on three RGB hand datasets (InterHand2.6M, HO-3D V2 and RHP) and three depth hand datasets (NYU, ICVL and HANDS 2017) verify A2J-Transformer+'s superiority and generalization ability for different modalities (i.e., RGB and depth) and hand cases (i.e., single hand, interacting hands, and hand-object interaction), even outperforming model-based manners. The test on ITOP dataset reveals that, A2J-Transformer+ can also be applied to 3D human pose estimation task. The source code and supporting material will be released upon acceptance.},

However, when the query point is far from the data points or the data points inherently represent a 2-manifold surface, their query performance may degrade. To address this, we propose a novel dynamic programming technique that precomputes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to encode the proximity structure between data points. More specifically, the DAG captures how the proximity structure evolves during the incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of the data points. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a speed increase of 1-10x. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates significant practical value in diverse applications. We validated its effectiveness through extensive testing in four key applications: Point-to-Mesh Distance Queries, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Registration, Density Peak Clustering, and Point-to-Segments Distance Queries. A particularly notable feature of our approach is its unique ability to efficiently identify the nearest neighbor among the first $k$ points in the point cloud, a capability that enables substantial acceleration in low-dimensional applications like Density Peak Clustering. As a natural extension of our incremental construction process, our method can also be readily adapted for farthest-point sampling tasks.

  abstract     = {Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to enable efficient learning of unseen few-shot tasks, by meta-learning from multiple pre-trained models without accessing their original training data. While existing DFML methods typically generate synthetic data from these models to perform meta-learning, a comprehensive analysis of DFML's robustness-particularly its failure modes and vulnerability to potential attacks-remains notably absent. Such an analysis is crucial as algorithms often operate in complex and uncertain real-world environments. This paper fills this significant gap by systematically investigating the robustness of DFML, identifying two critical but previously overlooked vulnerabilities: Task-Distribution Shift (TDS) and Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC). TDS refers to the sequential shifts in the evolving task distribution, leading to the catastrophic forgetting of previously learned meta-knowledge. TDC exposes a security flaw of DFML, revealing its susceptibility to attacks when the pre-trained model pool includes untrustworthy models that deceptively claim to be beneficial but are actually harmful. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a trustworthy DFML framework comprising three components: synthetic task reconstruction, meta-learning with task memory interpolation, and automatic model selection. Specifically, utilizing model inversion techniques, we reconstruct synthetic tasks from multiple pre-trained models to perform meta-learning. To prevent forgetting, we introduce a strategy to replay interpolated historical tasks to efficiently recall previous meta-knowledge. Furthermore, our framework seamlessly incorporates an automatic model selection mechanism to automatically filter out untrustworthy models during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments across various datasets with two types of untrustworthy models confirm the superiority of our method in significantly enhancing the robustness of DFML.

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, yet traditional image-based methods struggle in high-speed scenarios due to motion blur and temporal gaps caused by low frame rates. Spike cameras, with their ability to continuously record spatiotemporal signals, overcome these limitations. However, existing spike-based methods often rely on intermediate image reconstruction or discrete clustering, which limits their real-time performance and temporal continuity. To address this, we propose SNNTracker, the first fully spiking neural network (SNN)-based MOT algorithm tailored for spike cameras. SNNTracker integrates a dynamic neural field (DNF)-based attention mechanism for target detection and a winner-take-all (WTA)-based tracking module with online spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for adaptive learning of object trajectories. By directly processing spike streams without reconstruction, SNNTracker reduces latency, computational overhead, and dependency on image quality, making it ideal for ultra-high-speed environments. It maintains robust, continuous tracking even under occlusions, severe lighting variations, or temporary object disappearance, by leveraging SNN-estimated motion predictions and long-term online clustering. We construct three types of spike-camera MOT datasets covering dense and sparse annotations across diverse real-world scenarios, including camera ego-motion, deformable and ultra-fast motion (up to 2600 RPM), occlusion, indoor/outdoor lighting changes, and low-visibility tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNNTracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MOT methods—both ANN- and SNN-based—achieving MOTA scores above 96% and up to 100% in many sequences. Our results highlight the advantages of spike-driven SNNs for low-latency, high-speed, and label-free multi-object tracking, advancing neuromorphic vision for real-time perception.},

  abstract     = {3D plane reconstruction from images can usually be divided into several sub-tasks of plane detection, segmentation, parameters regression and possibly depth prediction for per-frame, along with plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation between frames. Previous works tend to divide and conquer these sub-tasks with distinct network modules, overall formulated by a two-stage paradigm. With an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions provided from the first stage, exclusively designed modules, potentially relying on extra plane correspondence labelling, are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce 6DoF camera pose. As none of existing works manage to integrate above closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework but treat them separately and sequentially, we suspect it potentially as a main source of performance limitation for existing approaches. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all sub-tasks related to multi-view reconstruction and pose estimation with a compact single-stage model, refraining from initial pose estimation and plane correspondence supervision. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets.},

  abstract     = {Image Style Transfer aims to replicate the style of a reference image based on the content from a text description or another image. With the significant advancements in image generation through diffusion models, recent studies have attempted to either fine-tuning embeddings to learn the single style or utilizing the pre-trained CLIP image encoder to extract style representations. However, style-tuning requires substantial computational resources and the pre-trained CLIP image encoder is trained for semantic understanding rather than for style representation. To address these challenges, we introduce a style-aware encoder and a well-organized style dataset called StyleGallery to learn a good style representation that is crucial and sufficient for generalized style transfer without test-time tuning. With dedicated design for style learning, this style-aware encoder is trained to extract expressive style representation from multi-level patches with decoupling training strategy, and StyleGallery enables the generalization ability. Moreover, we employ a content extraction and content-fusion encoder to enhance image-driven style transfer. We highlight that, our approach, named StyleShot, is simple yet effective in mimicking various desired styles, i.e., 3D, flat, abstract or even fine-grained styles, without test-time tuning. Rigorous experiments validate that, StyleShot achieves superior performance across a wide range of styles compared to existing state-of-the-art text- and image-driven methods.},

  abstract     = {Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to distinguish and track target objects in a video. Despite the excellent performance achieved by off-the-shelf VOS models, part of the existing VOS benchmarks mainly focuses on short-term videos, where objects remain visible most of the time. However, these benchmarks may not fully capture challenges encountered in practical applications, and the absence of long-term datasets restricts further investigation of VOS in realistic scenarios. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark named LVOS, comprising 720 videos with 296,401 frames and 407,945 high-quality annotations. Videos in LVOS last 1.14 minutes on average. Each video includes various attributes, especially challenges encountered in the wild, such as long-term reappearing and cross-temporal similar objects. Compared to previous benchmarks, our LVOS better reflects VOS models' performance in real scenarios. Based on LVOS, we evaluate 15 existing VOS models under 3 different settings and conduct a comprehensive analysis. On LVOS, these models suffer a large performance drop, highlighting the challenge of achieving precise tracking and segmentation in real-world scenarios. Attribute-based analysis indicates that one of the significant factors contributing to accuracy decline is the increased video length, interacting with complex challenges such as long-term reappearance, cross-temporal confusion, and occlusion, which emphasize LVOS's crucial role. We hope our LVOS can advance development of VOS in real scenes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose SS-NeRF, the end-to end Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based architectures for highquality physically based rendering with sparse inputs. We modify the classical spectral rendering into two main steps, 1) the generation of a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths, 2) the combination of these spectrum maps for the RGB output. The proposed architecture follows these two steps through the proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture (SpectralMLP) and spectrum attention UNet (SAUNet). Given the ray origin and the ray direction, the SpectralMLP constructs the spectral radiance field to obtain spectrum maps of novel views, which are then sent to the SAUNet to produce RGB images of white-light illumination. Applying NeRF to build up the spectral rendering is a more physically-based way from the perspective of ray-tracing. Further, the spectral radiance fields decompose difficult scenes and improve the performance of NeRF-based methods. Previous baseline, such as SpectralNeRF, outperforms recent methods in synthesizing novel views but requires relatively dense viewpoints for accurate scene reconstruction. To tackle this, we propose SS-NeRF to enhance the detail of scene representation with sparse inputs. In SS-NeRF, we first design the depth-aware continuity to optimize the reconstruction based on single-view depth predictions. Then, the geometric-projected consistency is introduced to optimize the multi-view geometry alignment. Additionally, we introduce a superpixel-aligned consistency to ensure that the average color within each superpixel region remains consistent. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to recent state-ofthe-art methods when synthesizing new views on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

These phenomena describe situations where ML systems may produce predictions that are inconsistent and incomprehensible to humans in certain specific cases. Such behavior poses a serious security threat to the practical application of ML systems. To exploit this vulnerability, several advanced attack paradigms have been developed, mainly including backdoor attacks, weight attacks, and adversarial examples. For each individual attack paradigm, various defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the robustness of models against the corresponding attacks. However, due to the independence and diversity of these defense paradigms, it is challenging to assess the overall robustness of an ML system against different attack paradigms. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of all existing defense paradigms from a unified lifecycle perspective. Specifically, we decompose a complete ML system into five stages: pre-training, training, post-training, deployment, and inference. We then present a clear taxonomy to categorize representative defense methods at each stage. The unified perspective and taxonomy not only help us analyze defense mechanisms but also enable us to understand the connections and differences among different defense paradigms. It inspires future research to develop more advanced and comprehensive defense strategies.},

As we know that traditional GCNs are generally defined on the fixed first-order neighborhood receptive field which makes them be incapable to capture the long-range dependencies between distant nodes and also vulnerable to graph attacks and noises. To address these limitations, we revisit deformable convolution on graphs and propose a novel deformable graph convolution, termed Neighborhood-Deformable Graph Convolution (NDGC). The core of NDGC is to explicitly achieve the deformable convolution on graphs by introducing virtual neighbors which encode large-range information via the offsetting and interpolation function. That is, the introduced virtual neighbors can provide a larger receptive field with deformable receptive shape for graph convolution definition. Also, NDGC conducts message aggregation on the deformable virtual neighbors which thus performs more robustly w.r.t. graph attacks and noises. In particular, NDGC provides a general neighborhood deformable scheme, seamlessly integrating with many graph convolution definitions to derive their deformable variants. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed NDGC networks on several graph learning tasks.},

Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires more energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost object detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving oriented objects common in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal counterparts (an approximate 36.5% increase in costs). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically, we observe that objects from aerial images usually have arbitrary orientations, small scales, and dense distribution, which inspires the following core designs: a Simple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate comprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW) loss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and corresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of aerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build the many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions via the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments conducted on various oriented object datasets under various labeled settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the DOTA-V2.0/DOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin (+2.90/2.14, +2.16/2.18, and +2.66/2.32) mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30% labeled data settings, respectively, with single-scale training and testing. More importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with 70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP, resulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method demonstrates stable generalization ability across different oriented detectors, even for multi-view oriented 3D object detectors. The code will be made available.},

  abstract     = {Integrating multimodal data of pathological image and gene expression for cancer survival analysis can achieve better results than using a single modality. However, existing multimodal learning methods ignore fine-grained interactions between both modalities, especially the interactions between biological pathways and pathological image patches. In this article, we propose a novel Pathway-Aware Multimodal Transformer (PAMT) framework for interpretable cancer survival analysis. Specifically, the PAMT learns fine-grained modality interaction through three stages: (1) In the intra-modal pathway-pathway / patch-patch interaction stage, we use the Transformer model to perform intra-modal information interaction; (2) In the inter-modal pathway-patch alignment stage, we introduce a novel label-free contrastive loss to aligns semantic information between different modalities so that the features of the two modalities are mapped to the same semantic space; and (3) In the inter-modal pathway-patch fusion stage, to model the medical prior knowledge of “genotype determines phenotype”, we propose a pathway-to-patch cross fusion module to perform inter-modal information interaction under the guidance of pathway prior. In addition, the inter-modal cross fusion module of PAMT endows good interpretability, helping a pathologist to screen which pathway plays a key role, to locate where on whole slide image (WSI) are affected by the pathway, and to mine prognosis-relevant pathology image patterns. Experimental results based on three datasets of bladder urothelial carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on the PAMT model, we develop a website that directly visualizes the impact of 186 pathways on all areas of WSI, available at http://222.128.10.254:18822/#/.},

  abstract     = {Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network. We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts.

  abstract     = {With the increasing concerns about privacy and data regulations, federated learning (FL) has been emerging as a solution to train machine learning models collaboratively with non-exchangeable data from multiple clients. As a result of data locality, data is usually not identically or independently (non-IID) distributed across clients, and the non-IID property has long been the key challenge in FL. Furthermore, in real-world cross-silo scenarios, it is ubiquitous that clients are organizations owning private data from multiple domains internally, which exacerbates the non-IID issue. For example, in healthcare applications, each client (hospital) gathers data from patients with heterogeneous demographics. While previous works have made efforts to address the non-IID challenge across clients by assuming various relations among client-level data distributions and enabling personalized models at the client level, they ignore the internal data heterogeneity within each client or require explicit data domain indicators, which are hardly accessible in real-world data. Here, we propose (SL-PFL) to bridge the gap. SL-PFL incorporates prototypical learning under the FL framework and provides a fine-grained personalized model for each data sample instead of learning one uniform model for all samples of each client. Meanwhile, it can be trained using data without ground-truth domain indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method with sample-level personalized models outperforms existing FL methods with a global model or client-level personalized models on various real-world regression and classification tasks from weather, computer vision, and healthcare applications.},

  abstract     = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables direct computation on encrypted data, making it a crucial technology for privacy protection. However, FHE suffers from significant performance bottlenecks. In this context, GPU acceleration offers a promising solution to bridge the performance gap. Existing efforts primarily focus on single-class FHE schemes, which fail to meet the diverse requirements of data types and functions, prompting the development of hybrid multi-class FHE schemes. However, studies have yet to thoroughly investigate specific GPU optimizations for hybrid FHE schemes. In this paper, we present an efficient GPU-based FHE scheme switching acceleration named Chameleon. First, we propose a scalable NTT acceleration design that adapts to larger CKKS polynomials and smaller TFHE polynomials. Specifically, Chameleon tackles synchronization issues by fusing stages to reduce synchronization, employing polynomial coefficient shuffling to minimize synchronization scale, and utilizing an SM-aware combination strategy to identify the optimal switching point. Second, Chameleon is the first to comprehensively analyze and optimize critical switching operations. It introduces CMux-level parallelization to accelerate LUT evaluation and a homomorphic rotation-free matrixvector multiplication to improve repacking efficiency. Finally, Chameleon outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementations by 1.23× in CKKS HMUL and 1.15× in bootstrapping. It also achieves up to 4.87× and 1.51× speedups for TFHE bootstrapping compared to CPU and GPU versions, respectively, and delivers a 67.3× average speedup for scheme switching over CPU-based implementation.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic resource allocation guarantees the performance of CGRA multi-task, but incurs a wide range of incompatible contexts (config & data) to the CGRA architecture. However, traditional context switch approaches including online config transformation and data reloading may significantly block the task to process inputs under new resource allocation decisions, resulting in the limited task throughput. To address this issue, online config transformation can be avoided if compatible configs have been prepared through offline pre-mapping, but traditional CGRA mappers require days to achieve comprehensive pre-mapping with considerable quality. Besides, online data reloading can also be eliminated through memory sharing, but the traditional arbiter-based approach has the difficulty of trading off physical complexity and memory access parallelism. PreTrans is the first system design to achieve the efficient CGRA multi-task context switch. PreTrans first avoids the online config transformation through a software incremental pre-mapper, which re-utilizes the previously finished pre-mapping results to dramatically accelerate the pre-mapping of subsequent resource allocation decisions with negligible mapping quality loss. Secondly, PreTrans replaces the traditional arbiter with a hardware data transceiver to better support the memory sharing that eliminates data reloading, which allows each tile to possess an individual memory that maximizes the access parallelism without introducing significant physical overhead. The overall evaluation demonstrates that PreTrans achieves 1.13$\sim 2.46\times$ throughput improvement on pipeline and parallel multi-task scenarios, and can reach the target throughput immediately after the new resource allocation decision takes effect. Ablation study further shows that the pre-mapper is more than 3 magnitudes faster than the traditional CGRA mapper while maintaining more than 99% of the optimal mapping quality, and the data transceiver only introduces 9.02% hardware area overhead under 16×16 CGRA.},

With any kind of precedence constraints and communication delays the problem becomes less manageable still. We look at the specific case of scheduling under the precedence constraints of a fork-join structure (including communication delays) $P[Q]|fork-join, c_{ij}|C_{max}$. This represents any kind of computation that divides into sub-computations with the end results being processed together. Looking at special cases where computation costs are equal, we propose polynomial time approximations and exact algorithms for them, considering homogenous and (related) heterogenous processors. Having those algorithms allows us to study the quality of heuristics in a large experimental evaluation. This demonstrates that heuristic schedulers perform well enough in most cases.},

First, we consider scheduling without deadlines, formulating it as a scheduling problem with rejection, where rejection costs are proportional to processing times. We propose a novel $\frac{5}{4}(1+\epsilon )$-approximation algorithm, $\mathcal{BEKP}$, by associating it to a Multiple Subset Sum problem, improving upon the existing $(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2m})$-approximation for arbitrary rejection costs.

By characterizing the non-overlapped communication overheads and convergence rate conditioned on stage-wise staleness, DynPipe carefully crafts an optimized pipeline partition that harmonizes the hardware speed with statistical convergence. Moreover, DynPipe deploys a non-intrusive random forest model that utilizes runtime stage statistics to evaluate the impact of environmental changes, such as task interference and network jitter, on the training efficiency. Following the evaluation guidance, DynPipe adaptively adjusts partition plan to restore both intra and inter-stage load balancing, thereby facilitating seamless pipeline reconfiguration in dynamic environments.

They are widely used in parallel and distributed systems (e.g., high-performance databases, distributed cache systems, and bioinformatics systems) to avoid unnecessary dataset accesses, thereby accelerating massive data processing. For AMQ data structures used in the above systems, achieving high throughput, low false positive rate, and large capacity objectives simultaneously is critical but challenging. Porting AMQ data structures from DRAM to persistent memory makes it possible to achieve the above three objectives simultaneously, but this porting is not a trivial task. Specifically, existing AMQ data structures generate numerous random accesses and/or sequential writes on persistent memory, resulting in poor throughput. Therefore, in the conference version of this paper, we proposed a novel AMQ data structure called wormhole filter, which achieves high throughput on persistent memory, thereby achieving the above three objectives simultaneously. In this journal version, we extend our prior work by introducing parallel wormhole filters to enhance parallel performance. Additionally, we integrate parallel wormhole filters into the LevelDB database system to show that porting AMQ data structures to persistent memory significantly improves system endto-end throughput. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that wormhole filters significantly outperform state-of-theart AMQ data structures. For example, wormhole filters achieve 12.06× insertion throughput, 1.98× positive lookup throughput, and 8.82× deletion throughput of the best competing baseline.},

In end-edge-cloud environments, workflow applications typically exhibit complex task dependencies. Meanwhile, parallel tasks from multi-MDs result in an expansive solution space for offloading decisions. Therefore, determining optimal offloading plans for highly dynamic and complex end-edge-cloud environments presents significant challenges. The existing studies on offloading tasks for multi-MD workflows often adopt centralized decision-making methods, which suffer from prolonged decision time, high computational overhead, and inability to identify suitable offloading plans in large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Collaborative method for Workflow Task offloading in end-edge-cloud environments with the Actor-Critic algorithm called MCWT-AC. First, each MD is modeled as an agent and independently makes offloading decisions based on local information. Next, each MD's workflow task offloading decision model is obtained through the Actor-Critic algorithm. At runtime, an effective workflow task offloading plan can be gradually developed through multi-agent collaboration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the MCWT-AC exhibits superior adaptability and scalability. Moreover, the MCWT-AC outperforms the state-of-art methods and can quickly achieve optimal/near-optimal performance.},

Given this background, we propose a systematic solution named MIST to safely eliminate global operations in MPI startup and termination. Through optimizing the generation of communication addresses, designing reliable communication protocols, and exploiting the resource release mechanism, MIST eliminates all global operations to achieve MPI instant startup and termination while ensuring correct program execution.

Existing distributed GNN training methods require frequent and prohibitive embedding exchanges between partitions, leading to substantial communication overhead and limited the training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose XDGNN, a novel distributed GNN training method that eliminates the forward communication bottleneck and thus accelerates training. Specifically, we design an explanation-guided subgraph expansion technique that incorporates important structures identified by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods into local partitions, mitigating information loss caused by graph partitioning. Then, XDGNN conducts communication-free distributed training on these self-contained partitions through training the model in parallel without communicating node embeddings in the forward phase.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local data. Despite its advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can affect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by quantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing methods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization errors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In this paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework that directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each communication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and transmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a single bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining bits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit while maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and Non-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves superior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting models. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using only 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.

Additionally, the large number of devices participating in IoT federated learning and training imposes a substantial computational burden on cloud servers. Current federated learning research primarily adopts centralized or discentralized learning architectures, which cannot fundamentally solve these issues. To address this, we propose a novel semi-centralized cloud-edge-device hierarchical federate learning framework that integrated both centralized and decentralized federated learning approaches. Specifically, only a subset of adjacent devices forms small-scale ring clusters, and the cloud server aggregates the ring models to construct a global model. To mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across devices, we use an incremental subgradient optimization algorithm within each ring cluster to enhance the generalization ability of the ring cluster models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces the impact of data heterogeneity, improves model performance, and significantly alleviates the communication burden on cloud servers compared to centralized and discentralized federated learning frameworks. Indeed, the framework proposed in this paper aims to balance the strengths of centralized federated learning and ring federated learning. It achieves superior performance in addressing the data non-IID problem compared to centralized federated learning architectures while also mitigating issues associated with excessively large rings in ring architectures.},

While the scheduling of real-time parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been extensively studied in the context of global scheduling, the scheduling and analysis of real-time DAG tasks under partitioned scheduling remain far less developed compared to the traditional scheduling of sequential tasks. Existing approaches primarily target plain fixed-priority partitioned scheduling and often rely on self-suspension–based analysis, which limits opportunities for further optimization. In particular, such methods fail to fully leverage fine-grained scheduling management that could improve schedulability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for scheduling periodic DAG tasks, in which each DAG task is transformed into a set of real-time transactions by incorporating mechanisms for enforcing release offsets and intra-task priority assignments. We further develop corresponding analysis techniques and partitioning algorithms. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate the real-time performance of the proposed methods against state-of-the-art scheduling and analysis techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods for scheduling periodic DAG tasks across a wide range of parameter settings.},

Simultaneously, the effects of data locality on reduce tasks are determined by the intermediate data partitioning. While suffering from the problem of data skew, the existing intermediate data partitioning methods only achieves load balancing for reduce tasks. To address the problem, this paper optimizes the data locality for reduce tasks by integrating intermediate data partitioning and task scheduling in Spark framework. First, it presents a distribution skew model to divide the key clusters into skewed and non-skewed distribution. Then, a data locality and load balancing-aware intermediate data partitioning method is proposed, where a priority allocation strategy for the key clusters with skewed distribution is presented, and a balanced allocation strategy for the key clusters with non-skewed distribution is presented. Finally, it proposes a data locality-aware reduce task scheduling algorithm, where an online self-adaptive NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with external input) model is developed to predict the idle time of node. It can ensure that the delayed scheduling decision made can complete the data transmission of reduce tasks earlier. We implement our proposals in Spark-3.5.1 and evaluate the performance using several representative benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method and algorithm can reduce the job/application running time by approximately 4% to 46% and decrease the total volume of data transmission by approximately 8% to 54%.},

  abstract     = {We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace (A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6% higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii) long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable approach to complex robotic manipulation.},

Inspired by octopus locomotion, we designed a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) piezoelectric plate robot using a 0.7 mm metal plate. Through drive region division and dynamic modeling, our design achieves fully controllable motion in any planar direction, providing the highest DoF among TW driven plate robots. Weighing just 14.2g, it is lighter and easier to fabricate compared to other 3-DoF piezoelectric robots. The robot demonstrated 3-DoF movement capabilities, climbing (16.5°), dragging (20 g), and carrying (180 g), and can bear over 5,000 times its own body weight. A wireless drive prototype with closed-loop control reduced trajectory errors by more than 80% compared to open-loop control.

Focusing on contact-rich rummaging, our approach leverages mutual information between the object pose distribution and robot trajectory for action planning. From an observed partial point cloud, RUMI deduces the compatible object pose distribution and approximates the mutual information of it with workspace occupancy in real time. Based on this, we develop an information gain cost function and a reachability cost function to keep the object within the robot's reach. These are integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) framework with a stochastic dynamics model, updating the pose distribution in a closed loop. Key contributions include a new belief framework for object pose estimation, an efficient information gain computation strategy, and a robust MPC-based control scheme.

  abstract     = {Curb following is a critical technology for autonomous road sweeping vehicles. However, existing solutions face two primary challenges: unreliable curb detection and inefficient motion generation. Unreliable curb detection stems from the wide variability in curb dimensions and types, as well as interference from roadside features such as vegetation and infrastructure. Inefficient motion generation occurs when existing methods prioritize tracking accuracy while neglecting task completion efficiency, leading to prolonged operation times. To address these challenges, we propose Curb-Tracker, an integrated curb-following system designed for autonomous vehicles operating in diverse road environments. Firstly, we develop a robust and adaptive curb detection algorithm that leverages a 2.5D elevation map of the local environment and dynamically adjusts key parameters online to ensure reliable detection across varying scenarios. Secondly, to achieve accurate and efficient curb-aligned motion generation, we leverage Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) as a tailored framework specifically designed for the curb-following task to generate an optimal control sequence for the vehicle to maintain a specified lateral offset from the curb while maximizing travel progress along it. The proposed system has been implemented on a Hunter 2.0, a front-wheel Ackerman-steering mobile robot, and has been validated through extensive experiments in both Gazebo simulation and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of the proposed system across a wide range of road scenarios.

These diverse approaches utilise different transduction methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities, enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate largescale tactile datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential.

Previous works require that each robot gathers information about the trustworthiness of all other robots, called trust observations, which can be time consuming in large networks. This paper decreases the time required to estimate trustworthiness by building upon an algorithm that leverages the concept of ‘Crowd Vetting’ and the opinion of trusted neighbors. This allows each robot to estimate trust in dynamic scenarios, where the team size, robot neighborhoods, and robot legitimacy can change. In particular, we employ an assumption that there exists quasi-dynamic time periods, where if a robot's legitimacy remains fixed for a sufficient length of time, its trustworthiness can be characterized. In this setting, we develop a closed-form expression for the critical number of time-steps required for our algorithm to successfully identify the true legitimacy of each robot within a specified failure probability. We show that the number of time-steps required for robots to correctly estimate the trust of all other robots increases logarithmically with the number of robots when robots do not leverage neighboring opinions, called the Direct Protocol. Conversely, for most general graph topologies, the number of time-steps required remains constant as the number of robots increases when our proposed algorithm, called quasi-Dynamic Crowd Vetting (DCV), is used, for a fixed ratio of legitimate to malicious robots. Finally, our theoretical results are successfully validated through simulated persistent surveillance tasks where robots maintain a desired distribution of robots over sites in the environment.},

  abstract     = {The recently developed approach to motion planning in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) provides an efficient framework for computing shortest-distance collision-free paths using convex optimization. This new motion planner is notably more computationally efficient than popular sampling-based motion planners, but it does not support non-convex cost functions. This paper develops a novel motion planning algorithm, Graph of Convex Sets with General Costs (GCSGC), to solve this problem. A given non-convex cost function is accurately approximated by a multiple-layer ReLU neural network and the configuration space is decomposed into a set of linear-cost regions using the hidden layers of the neural network. These linear-cost regions are intersected with a set of collision-free regions, and the resulting collision-free linear-cost regions are intersected to form the vertices and edges of the motion planner's underlying graph structure. The edge costs have a closed-form solution within each collision-free linear-cost region, but it is non-convex, so the McCormick relaxation is applied to convexify the edge costs. Finally, a graph pre-processing technique is developed to compute a representative graph structure that acts as a heuristic for the edge costs of the underlying GCS and then simplify the underlying graph structure by removing cycles and high-cost paths, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the planner and quality of the produced trajectories. The proposed motion planner is first validated in a 2D configuration space with comparisons between different sized neural networks with and without pre-processing, comparisons between optimal trajectories from GCSGC with shortest-distance trajectories, and comparisons between GCSGC and GCS-SLP. The GCSGC planner is further validated in a complex 7D configuration space by comparing to state-of-the-art multi-query (PRM*, GCS-SLP) and single-query (TrajOpt, BIT*, AIT*, RRT*) planners. The results show that the proposed motion planner is very competitive in terms of computational efficiency, trajectory cost, and memory footprint. Two physical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed motion planner in real-world motion planning applications.},

  abstract     = {Most individuals who experience a stroke exhibit several sensorimotor impairments that limit their independence in everyday activities. Hemiparetic gait is frequently characterized by reduced knee flexion in swing due to knee stiffness or muscle weakness and knee hyperextension or knee buckling in the stance phase. Recently, unilateral-powered orthoses have been designed to overcome the limitations of the passive knee-ankle-foot orthoses. This study presents a unilateral Active Knee Orthosis Exoskeleton, AKO-$\beta$, endowed with a series elastic actuator and designed to assist the knee in flexion and extension movements. The paper describes the system mechatronic design and its characterization on the bench, the control system, and pilot experiments with three post-stroke participants. The device has a weight of 1.78 kg on the user's leg, with a lateral encumbrance of 76 mm. The pilot experiments aimed to verify the effects of the exoskeleton assistance in hemiparetic gait patterns. When walking with the device, participants on average increased the knee flexion on the paretic side by 18.70 deg (+44.9%) during swing and decreased knee hyperextension in stance by 4.50 deg, compared to walking without it. Overall, when walking with the exoskeleton, subjects showed improved Gait Variable Score of the paretic knee profile by 37.5% compared to walking without it. The temporal and spatial gait symmetry indexes did not show clear changes, although an improvement in symmetry was observed in two of the three participants. These preliminary results suggest the potential benefits of the unilateral Active Knee Orthosis exoskeleton to enhance and restore mobility in individuals with hemiparetic gait.},

We present an anytime approach employing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method in continuous domains in terms of states, actions and observations and general-belief dependent reward and payoff operators. Unlike previous approaches, our method ensures safety anytime with respect to the currently expanded search tree without relying on the convergence of the search. We prove convergence in probability with an exponential rate of a version of our algorithms and study proposed techniques via extensive simulations. Even with a tiny number of tree queries, the best action found by our approach is much safer than the baseline. Moreover, our approach constantly yields better than the baseline action in terms of objective function. This is because we revise the values and statistics maintained in the search tree and remove from them the contribution of the pruned actions. We rigorously show that our cleaning routine is necessary. Without it, at the limit of convergence of MCTS, an infinite amount of sampled dangerous actions can be detrimental to the objective function.},

We train the model using a newly collected dataset that captures the grasping dynamics of a soft gripper equipped with multimodal perception capabilities. By incorporating the current state and image differences, the forward model can predict the soft gripper's physical interaction and movement in the image flow, which amounts to imagining future motion events.

  abstract     = {Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is crucial to many applications such as self-driving vehicles and robot tasks. However, it is still challenging for existing visual SLAM approaches to achieve good performance in low-texture or illumination-changing scenes. In recent years, some researchers have turned to edge-based SLAM approaches to deal with the challenging scenes, which are more robust than feature-based and direct SLAM methods. Nevertheless, existing edge-based methods are computationally expensive and inferior than other visual SLAM systems in terms of accuracy. In this study, we propose EdgeSLAM, a novel RGB-D edge-based SLAM approach to deal with challenging scenarios that is efficient, accurate, and robust. EdgeSLAM is built on two innovative modules: efficient edge selection and adaptive robust motion estimation. The edge selection module can efficiently select a small set of edge pixels, which significantly improves the computational efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. The motion estimation module improves the system's accuracy and robustness by adaptively handling outliers in motion estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted on TUM RGBD, ICL-NUIM and ETH3D datasets, and experimental results show that EdgeSLAM significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, which achieves 29.17% accuracy improvements with a high processing speed of up to 120 FPS and a high positioning success rate of 97.06%.},

  abstract     = {Locomotion on dynamic rigid surface (i.e., rigid surface accelerating in an inertial frame) presents complex challenges for controller design, which are essential to address for deploying humanoid robots in dynamic real-world environments such as moving trains, ships, and airplanes. This paper introduces a real-time, provably stabilizing control approach for humanoid walking on periodically swaying rigid surface. The first key contribution is an analytical extension of the classical angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model from static to swaying grounds whose motion period may be different than the robot's gait period. This extension results in a time-varying, nonhomogeneous robot model, which is fundamentally different from the existing pendulum models. We synthesize a discrete footstep control law for the model and derive a new set of sufficient stability conditions that verify the controller's stabilizing effect. Finally, experiments conducted on a Digit humanoid robot, both in simulations and on hardware, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in addressing bipedal locomotion on swaying ground, even under uncertain surface motions and unknown external pushes.},

Subsequently, the unknown sensor faults are approximated by the fuzzy neural network algorithm, and the uncertain parameters of MASs are tackled by the projection algorithm.

  abstract     = {NAS can automatically design well-performing architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been widely investigated for real-world applications. However, neural architecture search (NAS) is computationally expensive because vast DNNs are trained to obtain the performance during the search process. Performance predictors can directly obtain the performance of DNNs without training, thus having great potential to overcome this barrier. However, existing performance predictors are typically offline, and are trained with rare architectures labeled. As a result, their predictive ability is limited due to ignoring the promising DNN architectures generated in the NAS process. In this article, we propose a Gaussian process-based online performance predictor (GPOPP) tailored to evolutionary NAS. To achieve this, GPOPP selects the proper architectures to update itself during the search process upon EI as an acquisition function. Further, as architectures cannot be directly used as training data, GPOPP includes a binary encoding schema that can convert the architectures into a suitable format. Although the original intention of designing GPOPP is to provide an alternative way to build promising performance predictors that may compromise performance, the experiments show that GPOPP can outperform most state-of-the-arts. For example, GPOPP-assisted NAS gains 76.1% in accuracy on ImageNet with only 1.1 graphic processing unit (GPU) Days. In addition, the ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the components designed in GPOPP. The source code is available at https://github.com/songxt3/GPOPP.},

The adaptive event-triggered (ET) output feedback controller is proposed to handle unmeasured states and resource constraints. Then, to capture fuzzy information, a piecewise fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional incorporating membership functions (MFs) is meticulously constructed using delayed fuzzy system theory. The fuzzy information learning algorithm is further designed to determine and exploit the actual lower and upper bounds of MF’ derivatives, resulting in an effective controller with enhanced control performance and resource efficiency. Eventually, the ET strategy parameters, controller gains, and the optimal performance index are derived within a unified framework, ensuring global exponential stability and guaranteed H∞ performance.

Multimode switched systems can describe a wider range of complex processes, but most of the existing switching laws are fixed and lack flexibility. To address these issues, on the one hand, a transitive ILC (T-ILC) method is proposed to mitigate the effect of data network delay; on the other hand, a novel tracking performance-driven switching law (TPD-SL) is proposed. T-ILC can ensure the correct order of data through timestamps and memory identification. TPD-SL can ensure that the system switches to the subsystem with better tracking performance according to the change rate of the tracking error. Furthermore, we adopt an event-triggered communication method to save network computing resources. The stability of the system is demonstrated under the T-ILC and TPD-SL, and the relationship among network delay, event-triggering, and synchronous switching (controller switching aligned with system mode transition) versus asynchronous switching (controller switching with delayed mode transition) is analyzed. Numerical simulation results confirm that the method is effective.},

The method is applicable to signals in vector form composed of sum of multiple signals received from multiple sources. Another advantage of the method is that it is structured to operate online.

An effective model predictive control (MPC) scheme, integrating needle bending compensation and manipulative techniques, is proposed to ensure the safety, accuracy, and stability of acupuncture manipulative trajectory tracking control. Based on acupuncture’s working scenarios, a dexterous 2-DOF acupuncture mechanism is designed. Then, the kinematic and acupoint models are established. To enhance the controller’s robustness, trajectory tracking constraints are included as soft constraints in the objective function before needle insertion, leading to the development of a trajectory-constrained MPC (TCMPC) model. This model not only improves the tracking accuracy and convergence speed but also ensures the stability of the solution. Additionally, a needle bending correction trajectory control method, considering needle deformation, is derived to perceive and correct the needle bending deformation under complex force environments. Furthermore, an adaptive impedance control method, integrating feedforward-feedback control (FFC), is proposed to simultaneously control force and track manipulative techniques under various contact environments. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is verified using the Lyapunov theory.

Second, a solving flow is proposed based on the iteration-correction strategy for configuration prediction or force sensing. This strategy provides a new idea for the analysis of the static friction direction when the statics model is used for quasi-static prediction. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed segment-progress statics method is effective for configuration prediction or force sensing of concentric cable-driven manipulators.

The SDSBF method permits subsystems to lack safety over the whole safe set, which relaxes the traditional requirement that all subsystems are safe. Also, the influence on safety of switched systems caused by the difference of sampling instant and switching instant is analyzed, and a switching signal with dwell time is introduced to quantify and estimate this influence. Furthermore, both safety and stability of switched systems under ZOH controllers are obtained by the union of SDSBF and single Lyapunov function (SLF), without requiring the safety and stability for subsystems. To find SDSBF and SLF, an executable condition, including a switching law with dwell time, is established based on convex combination techniques, avoiding the Zeno phenomenon.

First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multiperspective categorization. Then, we systematically propose the roadmap to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses fidelity, diversity, and utility. We include a case study on aircraft engine maintenance, demonstrating the application of DGMs in industrial predictive maintenance.

  abstract     = {Current variable-convergence-parameter zeroing neural networks (ZNNs), including the VCP-ZNN and the FCP-ZNN, are either inefficient or unintelligent. Although researchers have discussed the application of ZNN in chaos synchronization, these ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers are rarely used in real-world applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no researchers have applied the ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers in secure voice communication. In this study, we established a novel chaos synchronization controller based on the proportional–integral-convergence-parameter ZNN (PICP-ZNN) model, which is both computationally efficient and intelligent. It was then used in secure voice communication. To demonstrate the superior features of the proposed PICP-ZNN model, we presented both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to show its fixed-time convergence, robustness, and adaptiveness. In addition, a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art variable-convergence-parameter ZNNs was presented to highlight our contribution further. The upper bound of the settling time is also estimated in both noisy and noise-free environments. Overall, this study offers a novel ZNN-based secure communication scheme. The PICP-ZNN models may serve as a novel source of inspiration for enhancing the variable-convergence-parameter ZNN even further.},

The fundamental mechanism is classifying operational modes and identifying the local models w.r.t. typical operating conditions, such that the global dynamic characteristics can be aligned with the switching control strategies for flexible operation demands. This article proposes a novel integrated economic predictive control (EMPC) method, to account for the mutual coupling economic optimization objectives and overlapping feasible regions in mode decision-making and dynamic control. In the proposed EMPC formulation, the prediction and optimization are carried out on all of the switched-admissible modes, which have been predetermined together with the stabilization conditions at the preliminary stage. The switching signal and input sequences are combined-optimized for achieving the best accumulated economic cost defined on the optimal predicted trajectories. The switching feasibility, and local/global stability under specified DT constraints are guaranteed by the stabilization constraints designed in EMPC. Through theoretical analysis and simulation comparisons, the proposed approach is demonstrated to tackle with the infeasible problem that inevitably arises in the classic hierarchical decision-making architectures; moreover, it exhibits better closed-loop accumulated economic cost in the illustrated cases.},

To solve this issue, an optimal pitch control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed for MOWTs, which comprehensively considers both power generation and load mitigation performance. First, the motion equation of the tower together with monopile under wind-wave environment is constructed on the foundation of the Euler–Lagrange equation. For the convenience of the controller design, a novel nonlinear affine MOWT mathematical model is presented, and an ADP-based optimal pitch controller is proposed to solve the multiobjective optimal control problem. Then, the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the system is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the proposed control method, a national renewable energy laboratory (NREL) 5-MW offshore code comparison collaborative (OC3) MOWT has been emulated using the OpenFAST platform developed by the NREL.},

Fuzzy reaction-diffusion NNs extend traditional NNs by incorporating spatial dynamics through reaction-diffusion processes, offering improved modeling capabilities for complex systems. However, the combination of reaction-diffusion terms and fuzzy modeling increases the complexity of dynamic analysis, particularly in synchronization control. To address these challenges, a novel random TSSDC (RTSSDC) framework is developed. The proposed approach integrates random sampling across both temporal and spatial dimensions with an innovative random event-triggered communication scheme to increase resource utilization efficiency and accommodate real-world network conditions. A unified closed-loop model is established by introducing a packet loss scheduling strategy to handle data disorder caused by significant transmission delays. The framework incorporates switching gains to provide additional flexibility and robustness. Ultimately, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the superior synchronization performance and efficient resource utilization under random sampling and network-induced delays.},

It involves three critical and interrelated operational optimization issues: 1) PS; 2) resource scheduling; and 3) manual picking. Each of them is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Their integration is a significant challenge for operational optimization in RMFS with multiple picking stations and represents a novel problem that was not studied before to our best knowledge. To tackle this complex problem and fill the research gap, we first model it as a MIP to derive exact solutions for small-scale and illustrative cases. For industrial-scale cases that cannot be solved by exact methods given limited time, we propose a tailored learning-strategies-enhanced local search algorithm. It integrates a 3-D bi-section encoding strategy, a three-stage decoding policy, a learning-based ANS method, and two learning-based tabu mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving 2.9% to 33.2% performance improvement over six competitive peers.

  abstract     = {Medium-scale expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) present a significant challenge to most existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). Because the algorithms must balance convergence and diversity with a limited number of fitness evaluations (FEs), while managing the uncertainty in surrogate predictions within the medium-scale decision space. Therefore, this work proposes a surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on two-level model management (SAMOEA-TL2M) to effectively address medium-scale EMOPs. In SAMOEA-TL2M, infill solutions are selected using the proposed two-level model management strategy. In the first level, the estimated non-dominated solutions with good shift-based density estimation (SDE) values are selected for the balance of convergence and diversity. In the second level, the estimated non-dominated solutions and high uncertainty solutions are considered. To quantify uncertainty, an inverse distance weighting (IDW) is introduced. Moreover, an accuracy rate indicator (ARI) is proposed for the optimization state assessment, providing guidance for adaptively executing the two model management levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used instances and time-varying ratio error estimation (TREE) problems with up to 120 dimensions demonstrate the superiority of SAMOEA-TL2M over five state-of-the-art SAEAs in solving medium-scale EMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication is pivotal for successful team collaboration in cooperative multiagent tasks. However, mainly due to the partially observable nature of the environment, indiscriminate message requests among teammates may lead to confusion for individual agents, impeding effective collaboration and diminishing the overall efficiency of the system. Most previous work has employed gates or attention mechanisms to extract relatively important messages. However, these methods often fail to explicitly assess each message’s value, or the process of calculating is intricate and convoluted. This may result in ineffective communication and cause miscoordination in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric named counterfactual message value (CMV), which quantifies each message’s contribution to an agent, enabling the effective elimination of redundant messages. In addition, we present a practical multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, termed CMV communication (CMVC), which could effectively facilitate the learning of agent–agent communication protocols. It predicts the CMVs of teammates for an agent solely based on its local observation, enabling the agent to initiate communication with those exhibiting positive CMVs. To differentiate message impact levels, we design a message aggregator in CMVC that aggregates messages based on their individual CMVs. We evaluate CMVC in various tasks, including cooperative navigation, predator–prey, and the StarCraft multiagent challenge (SMAC). The results indicate that CMVC is prominent in reducing redundant messages and has the ability to learn more advanced collaboration strategies, in contrast to several existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Its large-scale dynamic transaction records contain a variety of behavioral patterns and rich knowledge involving accounts, making the dynamic cryptocurrency transaction network embedding (DCTNE) a hot, yet thorny research topic. As the trading accounts increase and time accumulates, considerable transaction services are dispersed into various time slots, leading to very sparse transaction data within a time slot, that is, the transaction service data is high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI). To efficiently mine high-value knowledge from HDI data, this article proposes a proximal-ADMM-incorporated nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (PNL) model for DCTNE that adopts threefold ideas: 1) incorporating the proximal terms into the alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (ADMMs)-based learning scheme to reduce the oscillations for high estimation accuracy and fast convergence; 2) implementing a parallel training process with hyperparameter self-adaptation for high computational efficiency; and 3) proving that the proximal-incorporated learning scheme guarantees the convergence to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) stationary point. Experimental results on eight real-world DCTNs show that the PNL significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating not only high efficiency and accuracy in performing DCTNE, but also strong potential to enhance the operational reliability and stability of cryptocurrency transaction systems.},

As the number of participants continues to grow, the likelihood of undesirable outcomes increases, posing a great requirement for effective community detection algorithms. To provide platform owners with actionable and timely management strategies, this article proposes a multimodule-based dynamic community detection (MDCD) algorithm to facilitate the achievement of efficient, high-quality, and sustainable innovation. The MDCD algorithm uses a multimodule task learning framework containing four different modules, including heterogeneous temporal aggregation (HTA), representation reconstruction (RR), link prediction (LP), and node clustering (NC) modules, to gradually detect the community structure accurately. First, the HTA module obtains the initial node representation by capturing both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. Second, the RR module considers reconstructed topology and node attribute information to update the node representation via an encoder–decoder collaboration mechanism. Third, the LP module further optimizes the node representation by exploiting the predicted graph links, which helps increase the accuracy of community detection. Finally, the NC module leverages two metric learning methods to optimize a learnable clustering process based on the predicted node presentations, which helps platform owners achieve comprehensive results across multiple dimensions of innovation performance. The experimental results from real-world crowdsourcing platforms indicate that MDCD shows effectiveness in simultaneously improving the multidimensional innovation performance of crowdsourcing platforms and increasing solver engagement.},

Then, appropriate control parameters are designed in protocols to promote effective information transmission between layers and groups. Compared with existing FCC strategies, hierarchical bipartite time-varying FCC strategies improve the control performance of MASs.

Subsequently, we develop a data-based IRL approach to learn the unknown reward function and establish the weight tuning law of the value function and reward function using demonstrated state and input data. The proof of the uniform boundedness of the weight estimation error is presented. A simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the flexible job shop scheduling problem with a certain number of automatic guided vehicles (FJSP-AGVs), aiming to minimize the makespan. First, a novel constraint programming (CP) model is formulated to obtain optimal solutions. Specifically, the proposed CP model addresses the shortcomings of the existing CP model, which cannot solve instances with a machine processing two consecutive operations of the same job. Additionally, redundant and symmetry-breaking constraints are designed to accelerate constraint propagation and break problem symmetry, respectively. Then, to more effectively solve FJSP-AGVs, a CP-assisted meta-heuristic algorithm framework is designed, with a CP-assisted dual-population collaborative genetic algorithm (DCGA-CP) being developed as an example. Finally, experiments are performed on benchmark instances to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CP model and DCGA-CP. Experimental results show that the proposed CP models first prove 29 new optimal solutions and improve 27 best-known solutions. Meanwhile, DCGA-CP first proves 29 new optimal solutions and improves 32 best-known solutions for benchmark instances.},

First, a compensation reward based on the historical similarity between the RL agent and human guidance history is designed to ensure the continued influence of human guidance. To avoid cumulative errors in value function approximation caused by fitting the new reward, including the compensation reward, a novel RL paradigm is proposed, which bypasses value function fitting and directly optimizes the policy using historical similarity. This paradigm develops a new historical similarity-based learning objective for RL to leverage human guidance more efficiently and achieve alignment with human behavior. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm enables the fine-tuning of the RL agent to address the long-tail problem. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of sustainable guidance and optimal performance in the autonomous driving, achieving a 15% increase in optimal performance compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {In power systems, taking economic actions in accordance with the N-k criterion despite the failure of the components is becoming important in today’s smart grid. In this context, developing strategies against load shedding during unexpected events plays a critical role in ensuring energy sustainability. In this article, a loop-in-loop model that includes a rolling horizon-based distributed coordination is established among the transmission system operator (TSO), distribution system operator (DSO), and an industrial parking region operator (IPRO) connected to the transmission network (TN) to address unexpected TN contingencies. The model minimizes the total operational costs for each operator while also minimizing load shedding in the distribution network during contingency situations by leveraging the dc fast discharge capacity of heavy-duty electric trucks (HDETs) with a high-capacity battery located in the industrial parking region. In addition, a contingency system operator (CSO) is introduced to manage contingency and optimally reward the discharge of HDETs through a pricing mechanism. Consequently, in the rolling horizon-based real-time contingency management, the proposed approach reduces the economic losses for the TSO and the amount of shedding load for the DSO compared with uncoordinated operations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves up to 33.18% reduction in load shedding and 28.18% cost savings compared with the baseline scheme, confirming its effectiveness under contingency scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Traditional group decision making (GDM) problems typically aim to obtain a complete ranking of all considered alternatives from best to worst. However, in numerous real-life scenarios, there are instances where it is imperative to assign each alternative into one of two rank levels, creating a ranking where one subset of alternatives is prioritized above the other subset of alternatives. These scenarios are known as 2-rank GDM problems. While a range of methods exist for addressing 2-rank GDM problems, most are specifically tailored to multiattribute decision making situations, thereby limiting their applicability in scenarios involving preference relations. The linguistic preference relation (LPR) is an effective representation tool of decision makers’ (DMs’) preferences for pairwise comparisons of alternatives using linguistic terms. Since words may have different meanings for different DMs, a phenomenon known as personalized individual semantics (PISs), the modeling of linguistic PISs in 2-rank GDM problems with LPRs is worth investigating and challenging to address. Consequently, this article develops models to support consensus reaching for 2-rank linguistic GDM problems with PISs and consistency of DMs. Specifically, PIS consistency-driven models are initially employed to measure and improve the consistency of the LPRs of the individual DMs with unacceptable consistency level. Based on this foundation, the 2-rank vectors for both individuals and the group are determined. Subsequently, a 2-rank consensus measurement method is proposed on which a 2-rank consensus reaching process is designed to support DMs in improving their consensus levels. This involves the development of a PISs-based minimum adjustment consensus optimization model and a PISs-based individual consensus level maximization model. An algorithm to implement the proposed consensus reaching framework is also provided. Finally, numerical experiments and simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A novel sliding mode controller is proposed to handle this problem, and the closed-loop stabilities of NMRs under given control protocols are proven by Lyapunov theory. As special cases of TVF, the above control methods can be directly applied to flexible formation and fixed formation studied in existing works. It should be pointed out that if the desired formation is fixed, the angular velocity of the tracking target is not necessary when designing the corresponding control algorithm. In addition, there is no singularity in the methods provided in this article. By collaborative selection of parameters in these control protocols, the adjustment ranges of linear and angular velocities associated with the leader or virtual leader are almost the same as that of followers.

First, using the dynamic watermarking (DW) technique, a novel attack detection method is proposed to guarantee the security of information transmission among sensors. Compared to existing results on attack detection, the developed mechanism is capable of adapting to the ellipsoid-dependent set-membership estimation framework that incorporates the set ideas. Second, a group of scalable resilient set-membership estimators are derived for large-scale sensor networks. Each sensor has access to an ellipsoidal estimation set containing the true state of the system, in which the proposed design procedure is independent of global information about the network topology. Third, a set of parameter optimization algorithms is introduced in a recursive manner, which allows the sensor network to obtain a satisfactory estimation performance utilizing the designed estimation gain and detection mechanism. Lastly, a simulation example is shown to evaluate the availability and superiority of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal timing optimization (TSTO) is a significant problem in smart cities. Evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms have been widely studied to solve the TSTO problem. However, as existing EC-based algorithms usually use iterative-based evolution and simulation-based evaluation to optimize the timing plan for certain traffic situations, they still suffer from two difficulties, which are the time-consuming optimization process in certain traffic situations and the weak adaptation ability to unseen traffic situations. Therefore, this article proposes a novel learning for adaptation (LA) framework for real-time TSTO by changing the optimization process from evolution to adaptation. The LA learns a map model from the traffic volume input to the traffic signal timing. Then, the learned map model is expected to adapt to unseen traffic situations faster and better. The LA framework includes a data collection stage and a model learning (ML) stage. First, in the data collection stage, a multisource transfer-based particle swarm optimization (MTPSO) algorithm is proposed to avoid the under-optimizing issue. Second, in the ML stage, a multilevel smoothness regularization (MSR) method is proposed to deal with the over-fitting issue. The proposed LA framework with MTPSO and MSR is named as LMM method. This way, the TSTO process is changed from time-consuming evolution to time-efficient adaptation, which is significant in practical real-time applications. Comprehensive experiments with ten different synthetic and real-world road networks under different traffic volume distributions are carried out. The results show that the LMM method adapts better to unseen traffic volume inputs and can achieve real-time TSTO.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the issue of event-triggered prescribed-time tracking control for uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown parameters and external disturbances. A novel adaptive event-triggered proportional–integral (PI) funnel control protocol is proposed, where the switching threshold event-triggered strategy is adopted to conserve communication resources while guaranteeing the expected control performance. To obtain the global results, a new method combining adaptive techniques with the design of prescribed functions with infinite initial values is presented. Compared with the existing schemes, a more concise PI-funnel control method is provided to realize the global prescribed-time tracking control performance, which avoids the external disturbance estimation and calculation of derivatives at each step of the traditional backstepping method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through two simulation demonstrations.},

  abstract     = {Network reconstruction, which involves inferring a network’s topology from observational data, is a critical challenge in network science. Because observational data are often limited, prior knowledge is often employed to enhance the accuracy of network reconstruction, including constraints related to sparsity, symmetry, or network dynamics. In many cases, we may possess prior knowledge regarding the number of types of edges within networks, yet the specific solutions of these types of edges remain unknown. For instance, while it is evident that two types of edges (i.e., positive and negative) exist in signed networks, the possible solution for each edge type is frequently unclear, rendering existing methods, such as the signal Lasso approach, ineffective. In this work, to effectively leverage this readily available prior knowledge, we propose a novel network reconstruction framework based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which integrates Bayesian models and employs the GMM to model the distribution of unknown edges as prior probabilities. The method is effective for both unsigned and signed networks and achieves high accuracy even with limited prior information, without requiring specific solutions for each edge type, particularly in cases of network sparsity or noisy data.},

We introduce two definitions tailored to PBNs: disturbance decoupling in distribution and disturbance decoupling with probability one. Utilizing an algebraic representation framework, we derive algebraic conditions for both types of disturbance decoupling. Additionally, we employ a vertex partitioning approach to establish graphical conditions pertinent to these disturbance decoupling types. Our investigation further reveals the connections between DBNs and PBNs concerning disturbance decoupling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, we present three examples.},

  abstract     = {In general, the motion control problem of redundant robot manipulators (RRMs) can be transformed into a constrained time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. Recently, various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with predefined time convergence (PTC) abilities have been proposed to solve this constrained TVQP problem in real-time. However, there is still a lack of a unified paradigm to guide researchers and engineers design such RNNs more effectively based on specific requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified paradigm derived from a novel segmentation evolution formula incorporating a special $\mathfrak{B}$–Class function. This paradigm enables the construction of various RNNs, collectively referred to as unified arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNNs (U-APTC-RNNs). Compared with most existing RNNs, the constructed U-APTC-RNN has two significant advantages: 1) it has the arbitrarily PTC (APTC) ability, meaning its actual convergence time can be arbitrarily and precisely predefined without setting other model parameters and 2) using a novel piecewise computation strategy, redundant nonlinear calculations are effectively minimized, leading to a notable reduction in computational costs. The stability and APTC ability of the constructed U-APTC-RNN are demonstrated through detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulation experiments confirm the APTC capabilities of various U-APTC-RNNs constructed using the proposed unified paradigm. Comparative experiments show that U-APTC-RNN has more competitive convergence performance and lower computational cost than other state-of-the-art RNNs with PTC abilities. Finally, simulation and physical motion control experiments on the Jaco and UR5 robotic arms demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed U-APTC-RNN.},

In the weight allocation phase, individual weights are evaluated using network structure and the PageRank algorithm. For relationship propagation, indirect trust relationships are computed via a weighted average method, leading to a more precise social network model. In the evolution analysis, an improved Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model demonstrates evolutionary stability. Two types of conformity behavior are simulated: active conformity behavior within clusters and passive conformity behavior via opinion leaders across clusters. Experimental studies on public health policy validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that this model more accurately captures the complex behavioral patterns of individuals in large-scale social networks and exhibits strong evolutionary stability.},

This capability allows quadrupedal robots to select suitable foothold locations and adjust their gait for optimal performance. We address the problem of gait adaptation using trajectory optimization (TO), which takes into account the simplified switched system’s dynamics and optimizes the different phases of motion in which we split the robot’s movement. The robot dynamic model is a single rigid body (SRB) with a rigid contact model and foot positions. We apply contact and friction cone constraints to ensure a physically feasible motion of the real robot. We tackle the optimization using the direct multiple shooting (DMS) method. Leveraging kinematic inversion to map the base and feet positions into joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, we design a controller that combines iterative learning control (ILC) and proportional derivative (PD) feedback control. The iterative controller compensates for the sim-to-real gap, allowing the real robot to learn the task during the execution of the latter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two different quadrupedal robots and on different terrains.},

The designed controller enables the states of the closed-loop system and the estimation errors to be globally bounded.

In recent years, learning-based methods, as a novel technology, have been widely studied, hoping to overcome the high computational cost of traditional methods. However, to our best knowledge, timetable robustness, as another critical factor in TTR, is often ignored in existing work. To fill this gap, this study proposes a learning-based method for rapidly restoring train delays with robustness guarantees. Compared with the existing work, our approach offers several benefits. First, we design a network architecture for learning-based methods when solving the robust TTR problem. The dual-headed network can deal with the reordering and re-timing operation simultaneously in the TTR problem. Second, we reformulate the robust TTR problem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and a Lagrange-based proximal policy optimization (LPPO) algorithm is employed to train the designed network. Through testing on real-scale problems, the learned model can not only provide the rescheduled timetable within seconds but also strike a fine balance between operation efficiency and the scheme’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Visible–infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) focuses on accurately matching individuals across different imaging modalities. Existing studies focus on generating modality-consistent images at the pixel level through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the impact of modality discrepancies. However, these methods face significant challenges in overcoming the limitation that synthesized samples from different modalities may suffer from semantic distortion. In this work, we propose an online one-stage style fuzzy normalization (SFN) method to generate modality-fuzzy features in the latent space while regularizing the model’s predictions. Specifically, SFN adaptively mixes the feature statistics of two random modality instances of the same identity in a single forward pass during training. In this process, to enhance the richness of modality interaction information, we design a novel causality balance loss, which enforces the generated fuzzy features to be independent of their initial modality while simultaneously encouraging them to align more closely with the other modality. Furthermore, we introduce an identity-aware consistency loss to regularize the predictions between the original and SFN-generated features to ensure semantic consistency. In contrast to prior work, SFN is a plug-and-play module that does not rely on any generative-based models, making it highly adaptable to various network architectures. Extensive experiments were performed on three public cross-modality datasets to ensure fair and reliable comparisons. The empirical results demonstrate the clear superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

The membership functions are assumed to be mismatched due to the impact of the network environment and sampling behavior. Furthermore, the system dynamics are modeled using Itô-type stochastic differential equations, which include deterministic fuzzy complex networks (CNs) as a special case. Unlike previous studies on stochastic systems, the auxiliary vector function method is employed to introduce more time-varying delay information into the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), thus reducing conservatism. Consequently, a series of delay-dependent sufficient conditions is derived to ensure the exponentially mean-square stability (EMSS) and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system.

  abstract     = {This article investigates nonovershooting tracking control for a class of multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. Nonovershooting tracking control is desired in various practical situations, yet remains a challenging task with limited existing research. While the MIMO nonlinear system better represents real-world scenarios, the specific algorithm for nonovershooting tracking control has not been previously reported. In this study, a controller is designed to ensure system stability initially, while also achieving a closed-loop system for easy tracking error analysis. By deriving the expression of tracking error, a broad range of nonovershooting tracking conditions is identified through analytical analysis. The proposed nonovershooting control is shown to offer more extensive nonovershooting conditions compared to existing approaches, thereby reducing conservatism. Furthermore, this algorithm eliminates overshoot in MIMO nonlinear systems. Its effectiveness is validated through application to a two-degree-of-freedom robot manipulator.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) face significant challenges in trajectory tracking due to nonlinear dynamics, actuator faults, and environmental disturbances. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel fault-tolerant control strategy that ensures fixed-time trajectory tracking with prescribed accuracy for underactuated AUVs. The proposed approach integrates boundary functions with a constraint-handling mechanism, enabling guaranteed tracking performance within a fixed time horizon while satisfying output constraints. Unlike existing approaches, the controller does not rely on accurate system models, parameter estimation, or external observers, and avoids the computation of virtual control derivatives, resulting in reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the control scheme maintains robustness against time-varying actuator faults and environmental disturbances without auxiliary adaptation or learning mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods, validating its capability to maintain tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under adverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, CNN and Transformer hybrid networks demonstrated excellent performance in face super-resolution (FSR) tasks. Because of numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multiscale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided multiscale interaction network (AMINet), which incorporates local and global feature interactions, as well as encoder–decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a local and global feature interaction (LGFI) module to promote the fusion of global features and the local features extracted from different receptive fields by our residual depth feature extraction (RDFE) module. Additionally, we propose a selective kernel attention fusion (SKAF) module to adaptively select fusions of different features within the LGFI and encoder–decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multiscale features from within modules and between the encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.},

Second, an adaptive SMC (ASMC) is created to track the generated reference image feature trajectory with high precision. An LT adaptive control law is applied in this controller to overcome the system uncertainties’ impacts in the situation where the upper bound of uncertainty is unknown.

  abstract     = {Automatic 3D shape analysis is heavily influenced by the pose of input 3D models, as the continuous nature of pose space introduces complexities that usually exceed the encoding capacities of standard deep learning frameworks. To tackle this challenge, we present Upright-Net+, an enhancement of our previous model, Upright-Net, specifically developed for estimating upright orientation in 3D point clouds. Our approach is grounded in the design principle that ”form ever follows function,” treating the natural base of an object as a functional structure that stabilizes it in its typical pose, influenced by physical laws and geometric properties. We reformulate the continuous orientation problem into a discrete classification task, focusing on learning the points that constitute the natural base of a 3D model. The upright orientation is determined by aligning the normal orientation of this base towards the mass center. To mitigate over-smoothing in the global feature embeddings from stacked graph convolutional layers, we introduce a Global Positional Encoding Module using Relative Distance Histogram Statistics Embedding (GPE-RDHS), which reduces structural ambiguity and enhances orientation estimation. We also enhanced a weighted residual loss term to penalize false positive predictions, enhancing overall model performance. Our method demonstrates exceptional performance in upright orientation estimation and reveals that the learned orientation-aware features significantly benefit downstream tasks, particularly in classification.},

  abstract     = {Estimating dense point-to-point correspondences between two isometric shapes represented as 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, with applications in texture and motion transfer. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when the shapes undergo non-rigid transformations, as is often the case with approximately isometric point clouds. Most existing algorithms address this challenge by establishing correspondences between functions defined on the shapes, rather than directly between points, because function mappings admit a linear representation in the spectral domain. State-of-the-art methods compute this linear representation using the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami Operator (LBO) along with a small set of initial corresponding functions between the shapes. However, for approximately isometric point clouds, two key issues arise: (1) the eigenfunctions of the LBO may become misaligned, and (2) the initial corresponding functions may include outliers, both of which degrade the quality of the resulting correspondences. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to align the spectra of the LBOs of the two shapes, enabling the eigenfunctions to remain compatible even for approximately isometric 3D point clouds. Additionally, we introduce a technique to make function correspondence estimation robust to outliers. We validate our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art 3D shape-matching algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

The methods based on random phase can alleviate this problem, but they always affect the imaging quality of the focal plane. Meanwhile, direct current (DC) noise of nondiffracted light in SLMs, coupled with ubiquitous dynamic noise, has long been a fundamental issue affecting holographic display quality. In this study, we proposed a method based on static high-pass filtering and time-multiplexing that overcomes the traditional tradeoff between divergence capability of holograms and display quality in focal planes. Simultaneously, the proposed method can eliminate DC and dynamic noise with a simple and robust structure. Moreover, we further extended artificial intelligencedriven algorithms to achieve higher-quality on-axis amplitudeonly holograms.

  abstract     = {High-resolution images come with rich color information and texture details. Due to the rapid upgrading of display devices and rendering technologies, high-resolution real-time rendering faces the computational overhead challenge. To address this, the current mainstream solution is to render at a lower resolution and then upsample to the target resolution by supersampling techniques. However, while many prior supersampling approaches have attempted to exploit rich rendered data such as color, depth, motion vectors at low resolution, there is little discussion on how to harness high-frequency information that is readily available in the high-resolution (HR) G-buffers of modern renders. In this paper, we seek to investigate how to fully leverage information from HR G-buffers to maximize the visual quality of supersampling results. We propose a neural network for real-time supersampling of rendered content, which is based on several core designs, including gated G-buffers encoder, G-buffers attended encoder and reflection-aware loss. These designs are especially made for the sake of effectively using HR G-buffers, enabling faithful recovery of a variety of high-frequency scene details from low-resolution, highly aliased inputs. Furthermore, a simple occlusion-aware blender is proposed to efficiently rectify invalid features in the warped previous frame, allowing us to better exploit history information to improve temporal stability. The experiments show that our method, equipped with strong ability to harness HR G-buffer information, significantly improves the visual fidelity of high-resolution reconstructions upon previous state-of-the-art methods, even for challenging $4 \times 4$ upsampling, while still being compute-efficient.},

This difficulty arises from two main factors: first, imperfections in the point cloud data, such as lack of orientation, noise, and sparsity; and second, the inherent complexity of geometric shapes, which often feature a high density of sharp edges in close proximity. In this paper, we propose D-FRAME, a multi-stage wireframe extraction framework that incorporates a novel direction field to improve edge detection quality and connectivity, a refinement strategy to address sparse or noisy edge points, and a final coarse-to-fine connection module to extract a robust wireframe. The direction field not only facilitates connectivity but also enhances the precision of extracted edges by mitigating the impact of misclassified points. By combining the Restricted Voronoi Diagram (RVD) with the extracted wireframes and the original point cloud, our approach also achieves highly faithful reconstruction of CAD model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world scanned CAD datasets demonstrate that D-FRAME effectively manages noise, sparsity, and complex geometries, yielding high-fidelity wireframes.

While object-centric 3D generation has achieved significant progress, scene generation remains difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D scene datasets and scalability constraints of conventional 3D representations, which hinder efficient large-scale expansion. To address these challenges, we propose LucidDreamer, a novel pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality, and expandable 3D scenes using a unified 3D Gaussian splatting representation. Our approach employs an iterative Navigation-Dreaming-Alignment process, leveraging 2D image generation and depth estimation to construct photorealistic, scalable 3D environments. By iteratively generating images and navigating through the scene, LucidDreamer fully utilizes the power of image generation models, enabling the creation of highly detailed and expandable 3D scenes. LucidDreamer supports various input modalities, including text, RGB, and RGBD, and enables dynamic modifications during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that LucidDreamer outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse, structurally consistent, and navigable 3D scenes.

We use Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE) to extract a probability density distribution from the KVN for the the Monte Carlo calculations. Even though the distribution of the KVN can be non-trivial, AKDE yields a smooth and normalized result which we dynamically update at each time step. As we sample actual particles directly, the Lagrangian attributes of particle samples ensure that the continuously evolved KVN-based importance, modeled by the probability density distribution extracted from the KVN by AKDE, can be closely followed.

  abstract     = {This work proposes a trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, for task offloading in UAV-as-a-Service. Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components – (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Parking trajectory planning in loading/dumping areas of open-pit mines presents unique challenges compared to standard parking scenarios for passenger vehicles. These include irregular workspaces, kinematic constraints of heavy trucks, and customized trajectory requirements, which collectively formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-differentiable logical condition constraints. Mainstream MINLP solvers struggle to directly handle logical conditional constraints involving integer variables and usually fail to meet the real-time requirements of practical applications. This study presents a nearly global optimal trajectory planning method that developed a search-then-optimize framework based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, separating the difficulties into distinct stages. A multiple-priority-queue search-based method is introduced in the search stage, leveraging its gradient-free nature to tackle non-differentiable variables and generate an initial solution near the global optimal solution. In the numerical optimization stage, the problem is reformulated as a fully differentiable NLP, refining the initial trajectory to enhance quality. Extensive simulations and real-vehicle tests confirm that this method effectively addresses the above difficulties, producing efficient and trackable trajectories.},

However, they are often susceptible to disruption due to natural disasters, which can have significant economic and social impacts. In order, to mitigate the aforementioned impacts, a novel spatio-temporal risk-based optimization framework for designing disaster-resilient communication networks is introduced. This framework addresses both cost-effectiveness and risk minimization in a unified manner. The effects of physical damage, power disruption, and recovery dynamics on the outage probability over time are incorporated into a dual-objective optimization model. A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints. This methodology has been demonstrated to enhance network resilience in high-risk regions while incurring no additional costs, thus providing a scalable and adaptable solution applicable to a variety types of natural hazards and geographic contexts.},

  abstract     = {In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of computing-intensive vehicular applications, limited on-board computing resources become insufficient to meet the computing requirement of many vehicular applications. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) task offloading is a promising approach to addressing the limited on-board computing resources of vehicles. Meanwhile, the rapid development of radio access technologies (RATs) has enabled a vehicle network to incorporate multiple RATs for supporting data transmissions between vehicles. This article studies the V2V task offloading problem in a vehicular network with multiple RATs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem with an objective to minimize the average offloading delay of all offloading tasks generated by vehicles in the network at a given time by optimizing offloading decisions and computing resource allocation, subject to the delay constraints of the tasks and the computing resource constraints of the vehicles. To solve the formulated problem, a log-sum-exp approximation is used to transform the MINP problem into a combinatorial optimization problem to obtain a probability distribution of all possible solutions to the problem. Based on the probability distribution, a Markov chain based method is used to obtain the transition probabilities between different solutions and based on the transition probabilities, a learning-based offloading decision and computing resource allocation (L-D&A) algorithm is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. The L-D&A algorithm introduces a learning process, in which the problem is decomposed into three sub-problems: SV and RAT selection (SRS), sub-channel selection (SCS), and computing resource allocation (CRA), and correspondingly a Markov chain-based SRS algorithm, an interference minimization based SCS algorithm, and a convex optimization based CRA algorithm are proposed to solve the three sub-problems, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed L-D&A algorithm can efficiently reduce the average offloading delay as compared with three benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time operation. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs. For a dense network where existing access points (APs) have already built their respective CKMs, it will be useful to construct CKMs of potentially new APs with only their location information. The generation of CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient CKM initialization, environment-aware new AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. For APs in the same region that share the same physical environment, there is a natural correlation between their CKMs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.},

This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.},

We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent.

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services. Numerical results show the efficiency of the obtained strategies for electric vehicles charging and power economic dispatching, and the two-stage modeling approach significantly improves the convergence of the model and the quality of the solution.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely employed across various domains, with its applications expanding as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies advance, bringing new scenarios and functionalities to 360-degree video streaming. However, these applications impose substantial demands on computational power and communication capacity, along with increased sensitivity to computation and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic interference (EMI) poses a significant negative impact on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications. In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.},

  abstract     = {This article demonstrates that the performance degradation in wireless communication localization can result from multiple access interference (MAI). To address this issue, we introduce a new supervised machine-learning technique named direct learning localization (DLL). This approach determines user locations by analyzing the statistical model of received signal strength (RSS) at base stations. Our method utilizes the probability density function (PDF) of RSS rather than its instantaneous values. It operates independently of the prior knowledge of channel statistics and MAI profiles, as the RSS PDF is derived from direct observations. Consequently, our method obviates the need for interference cancellation algorithms and incorporates interference profiles as a part of the localization fingerprint. DLL calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the RSS PDFs of training and test users as a measure of dissimilarity. Utilizing these dissimilarities, it then predicts user locations with a logistic regression model. We demonstrate that DLL significantly enhances localization accuracy in the presence of MAI and outperforms other methods in the literature. Additionally, we present an analysis of the algorithm's performance to prove its reliability.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, it is essential to periodically verify the safety of firmware and software in vehicle computers. Remote attestation of nodes in such swarm networks is necessary to ensure the absence of embedded malware in their code. However, most existing remote attestation schemes rely on public key infrastructure (PKI), which suffers from certificate management challenges, or require specialized hardware that may not be available on all device nodes. Some approaches use physically unclonable functions (PUFs), but these are often impractical due to the large memory required to maintain challenge-response pairs for each session and node in the swarm. Moreover, PUF-based methods are vulnerable to modeling attacks and sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we propose a practical and secure anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme, designed to implement a novel attestation algorithm in IoV environments. Our proposed attestation algorithm employs content-based pseudo-random traversal, eliminating the need for checksum computations after each memory read. Importantly, our scheme does not require special hardware, such as TPMs or PUFs, to be embedded in On-Board Units (OBUs). Additionally, it supports the heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability of swarm networks. We validate the security of our scheme through game-based proofs in the random oracle model and formal verification using the Tamarin Prover. Practical implementation results further highlight the superiority of our scheme, confirming its suitability for attesting prover nodes in swarm IoV networks.},

In particular, we adopt a spatiotemporal graph to represent complex state information, and a graph prediction network to anticipate missing communication data, effectively stabilizing observation fluctuations. In order to improve decision-making in complex environments, a relational graph learning mechanism is introduced, where Graph Attention Networks (GATs) extract agent features based on specific relational types, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism aggregates these features. Combined with localized detection, this approach enhances decision-making from complex observation. Additionally, well-tailored reward functions further encourage agents to restore communication and cooperation. The results indicate that RGATD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, increasing encirclement success and reducing capture time under fluctuating communication conditions.},

Current authentication schemes often fail to fully address the reliability of Road Side Units (RSUs) and typically overlook issues related to single points of failure. Additionally, these schemes do not adequately consider secure and efficient handover authentication during vehicle access, leading to increased computational and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BAKP, a blockchain-assisted anonymous authentication and key agreement protocol designed specifically for IoV contexts. BAKP enables secure access authentication for vehicles connecting to network services, even in scenarios where RSUs are semi-trusted. When the vehicles re-request network services, the RSUs bypass the authentication center and directly query the blockchain-recorded authentication results, thereby streamlining the handover process. The protocol also supports the revocation of pseudo-identities and enhances the transparency in tracing malicious entities. We performed a provable security analysis of BAKP using the Standard Model, along with formal security evaluations employing Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and the DolevYao attacker model. Our results confirm that BAKP is robust against all relevant attacks and demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive performance evaluations.},

In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem.

Consequently, the radar receiver necessitates the complete enumeration of embedded information as a prerequisite for target echo processing, which may lead to unaffordable consumption of storage resources and force existing platforms to change their processing framework and operational timing. To address this issue, we consider a system configuration that lacks storage resources for the transmitted information and jointly design the transmit waveform and radar receive filter to achieve DFRC. Based on the discrete frequency-coding (DFC) waveform, a new coding sequence structure is designed to manipulate communication embedding and introduce the orthogonality of DFC into radar operations. The receive filter is jointly developed without requiring knowledge of communication symbols, enabling robust radar detection while preserving the system's computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed waveform and filter combination exhibits resistance to certain jamming techniques.

Thanks to the mobility and maneuverability of UAVs, we can transform the interference management and route scheduling problems of C-UAVs into an anti-interference trajectory planning problem, aiming to jointly minimize the UAV mission time and transmission outage time. However, none of the existing methods have taken both the spatio-temporal uncertainty of interference sources and multi-UAV trajectory planning into consideration. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as uncertainty-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (UA-MARL), for anti-interference trajectory planning of C-UAVs. In UA-MARL, a transmission outage probability (TOP) has been introduced to improve the robustness of the model. A transmission outage probability experience memory (TOPEM) has been designed to increase sample efficiency and reduce inference time. MARL algorithms integrated with an adaptive post-decision state (PDS) have been introduced to accelerate the convergence and stabilize the training. Experimental results show that UA-MARL outperforms baselines in average reward, convergence efficiency, and convergence stability. Furthermore, we find that higher residential density and wider considered area will lead to a decrease in training efficiency and stability.},

  abstract     = {Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.},

The coverage probability analysis considering the interference effect due to the multiple UAVs is derived theoretically and verified by simulations. Also, the simulation results are compared with the Walker-based constellation, which is a practical constellation for LEO satellites. It is represented that the stochastic geometry-based results and Walker-based simulation results are very compatible with each other. Moreover, the effects of the UAV altitude, channel conditions, and the amount of UAVs that are utilized for cooperative communication are analyzed to obtain the comprehensive performance results.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn a lot of attention in the study of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, the fundamental drawback of Doppler intolerance limits its applicability in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicular applications. In addition, the delay and Doppler shift that are non-integer times the resolution cause the off-grid effect, leading to scalloping loss and increasing the sidelobes. In this work, a super-resolution range-doppler map (RDM) modeling algorithm with low complexity is proposed to suppress these impacts. The proposed algorithm models the RDM contributed by the detected targets jointly via 2D surface fitting and then reconstructs and subtracts the corresponding signal components from the original received signal. Consequently, the weaker targets hiding under the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and off-grid effect become detectable. The communications capability is not impacted since the algorithm is only deployed at the radar receiver. In addition, two variants of the algorithm are illustrated, showing a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively suppress ICI and mitigate off-grid effects, while simultaneously enhancing the accuracy of delay and Doppler estimation. It is indicated that the proposed algorithms can provide sufficient improvements in multi-target scenarios.},

The methodology initiates with the semantic compression of images using the clustering vector quantization autoencoder semantic compression (CAESC) method, which significantly reduces the data volume transmitted while maintaining minimal impact on reconstruction quality. Subsequently, the scheme employs a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network for predicting image sequences. Empirical simulations show a 48- fold reduction in data transmission volume with minimal loss in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our predictive methodology significantly improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), showing about a 43% increase during one constant delay period over conventional approaches.},

However, UAV swarm-based MNCT tracking faces critical challenges in real-world environments, including sensing interference and data heterogeneity. To address this and realize per-sensing-round updates of the models deployed on the UAV swarm, we propose FedMES, a federated learning framework that jointly optimizes data reliability and model performance. First, we design a data filtering mechanism using polynomial fitting and moving average correction to suppress destructive noise. Second, dynamic aggregation weights are assigned based on historical data confidence to prioritize high-reliability clients. Third, clients selectively adopt the global or local model via a dual-metric evaluation post-aggregation. Evaluated on real-world MNCT trajectories, FedMES reduces mean estimation errors by 10%-22% compared to FedAvg/FedProx, demonstrating superior robustness under high noise and data loss.},

By constructing a hierarchical AISGP model and combining a residual prediction model, the model can efficiently capture unmodeled vehicle dynamic characteristics and noise interference. The AISGP-MHE module optimizes the state estimation of lateral velocity and yaw rate, and the AISGP-MPCC module optimizes the path tracking control strategy by minimizing the contour and lag error. Evaluations on CarSim demonstrate that the proposed method improves vehicle tracking accuracy by 17% compared with traditional schemes, and the inference speed of AISGP is 8.4 times faster than that of Gaussian Process (GP).},

  abstract     = {The data processing capability of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS)-assisted cell-free mobile edge computing (MEC) is constrained by both the offloaded data traffic during wireless transmission and the computed data traffic in the MEC server. The effectiveness of wireless transmission is adversely affected by channel estimation errors. Additionally, fairness is a critical consideration in multi-user scenarios. However, achieving fair multi-user traffic matching in IRS-assisted cell-free MEC networks with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains an unsolved issue. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a max-min multi-user traffic matching (M3TM) strategy for transmission and computing, which mitigates the impact of channel estimation errors through stochastic analysis. The proposed strategy applies a sequential transmission paired with immediate sequential computing mode to ensure IRS gain for each user and improve computing resource utilization efficiency. A cell-free wireless transmission sub-model is proposed with a stochastic analysis of channel estimation errors. Based on the transmission sub-model, a transmission-computing traffic matching model, representing the processed data volume for each user, is proposed, which comprehensively accounts for the mutual constraints between wireless transmission and edge computing. Subsequently, a max-min processed data volume optimization problem is formulated, leveraging the max-min criterion to ensure fairness among users. To address the non-convex formulated problem and alleviate the adverse impact of channel estimation errors, a variable grouping optimization algorithm is proposed, which combines a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method with a proof-by-contradiction approach to optimize different groups of variables. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

Meanwhile, deploying cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) enables cooperation among multiple base stations (BSs), further bringing about cooperative gains. However, the mechanism of ISAC-based multi-BS cooperative tracking is still unclear, and the moving VUs also pose significant challenges for multi-BS cooperative dynamic interference management. Driven by the above issues, this paper investigates a cooperative ISAC (Co-ISAC) tracking system that supports rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission strategies for complex vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. First, we consider VUs with complex trajectories and design the system workflow based on the interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMM-UKF) framework and the theory of weighted least squares (WLS). Next, we investigate multi-BS joint transmission strategies based on single-carrier RSMA (SC-RSMA) and multiple-carrier RSMA (MC-RSMA). The latter is designed for more challenging wireless environments with a small number of antennas and adds to the former a grouping method based on graph theory and an inter-group power allocation method based on predicted state vectors suitable for dynamic scenarios. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the RSMA-enabled Co-ISAC tracking system performs better than other baseline schemes in complex V2I scenarios.},

Thermal enhanced dynamic window-based planner is proposed by integrating temperature information into local path planning. Secondly, prediction-aware NavFn is developed for robotic path replanning. Combining YOLOv7 and DeepSORT algorithm, the dynamic target is recognized and tracked. Linear extrapolation is employed to predict trajectory.

The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagamim fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy. Notably, our proposed system outperforms benchmark systems, particularly those based on orthogonal multiple access, with an 86% enhancement for primary users and 64% for secondary usersnk},

  abstract     = {The space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), a fundamental component of the broader space-air-ground integrated network, plays a critical role in the future communication infrastructure by facilitating global connectivity, efficient resource allocation, and robust service delivery. The generalized filter bank orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (GFB-OFDM) has emerged as an innovative waveform in this network that enables flexible subband processing, achieves low out-of-band emissions, and seamlessly supports both terrestrial and satellite systems. To further investigate the GFB-OFDM detection, this paper first derives the input-output relation of the communication system using the GFB-OFDM in a matrix form, which is then used to formulate both the linear and the nonlinear detection. Considering the tradeoff between limited reliability and high computational complexity of the existing detection schemes, a low-complexity expectation propagation detector is proposed for the GFB-OFDM system to strike a better balance. By applying the second-order Richardson iteration, the posterior mean vector of the transmitted symbols is approximated to avoid the direct matrix inversion, thereby reducing the computational complexity. We then adopt an approach to approximate the eigenvalues in each iteration such that the computational complexity involved by the matrix decomposition is significantly reduced while maintaining a competitive error performance. Furthermore, the computational complexities of various detection schemes are precisely analyzed and evaluated focusing on the numbers of the complex multiplications. At last, the error performance, the power spectral density and the peak-to-average power ratio of the GFB-OFDM and other waveforms are evaluated in the space-terrestrial scenario. The extensive simulation results validate our conclusion making it a promising solution for practical deployment in STIN scenarios such as low earth orbit satellite broadband communication.},

  abstract     = {Tactical decision-making plays a key role in ensuring the operational safety of autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent environment perception techniques are built upon the deep learning (DL) approaches and utilize probabilistic representations to quantitatively capture the inherent uncertainties in networks. The downstream decision-making module shall utilize the perceived probabilistic information to derive proper maneuver decisions. However, how to translate the uncertainties of DL between the two stages to manage the risk remains an open problem. This paper proposes a holistic and interpretable framework that can explicitly represent uncertainties of DL-based perception and generate safe maneuvers by accounting for such uncertainties. By quantifying and propagating uncertainties of perceptions networks, an explicit link is established between DL perception uncertainty and safety utility of decision-making via the Adaptive Likelihood mechanism. Built on this basis, we propose an uncertainty-aware decision-making approach (PUALD-Net) that can incorporates both regression and classification perception uncertainties into probabilistic reasoning and derive risk-bounding decisions. Real-world field test results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively ensure safety, and outperforms existing approaches in terms of safety and driving capability metrics (Infraction Rate and Driving Score) in adverse scenarios incurring high perception uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In an Information Centric Network (ICN), a client acquires data by disseminating an ‘interest’ packet across the network. For ease of accessing, the interest packet carries the name of the desired content. If any intermediate node receives the interest packet and possess the named content, then it serves the client from it's own cache instead of forwarding it to the actual content producer. Hence, if interest packets are efficiently forwarded to the most appropriate content store, then the content retrieval process would be significantly faster. In this paper, a strategic game based interest forwarding techniques is proposed for Information Centric Vehicular Networks (ICVN). The game is played among network entities such as mobile vehicles, road side units (RSUs) and edge servers (ESs). Every such entities keep track of their neighbors' information in a table which assist them in playing the game by identifying the potential neighbors that may hold the searched content. During the game, participants (i.e. the players) earn credits based on their behavior during a deal. It in turn calculated based on some payoff function driven by selected strategy. A network entity (also called node) with higher credits got higher preference in playing the game. Moreover, the payoff is computed as a function of content retrieval cost and the mobility profile of the node. The cost of content retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on the service probability ($s_{p}$) and the mobility profile ($r_{m}$) of the selected neighbor. The $s_{p}$ is derived from the past service history and $r_{m}$ is derived from the mobility pattern. Proposed protocol is evaluated mathematically followed by comparative study in $ns$-3. Performance of the proposed protocol is compared with three existing approaches and found that the new algorithm performs better in terms of interest success rate, content retrieval time, server hit ratio and network overhead.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising candidate for green communication because of its passive characteristic. However, the employment of large-scale RIS or multiple RISs for enhancing the system rate may lead to extra overhead or power consumption. In addition, cell-free (CF) network is preferred in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to its ability to against the inter-cell interference. Hence, a phase modulation array (PMA)-based sparse RIS-aided CF multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed for IoT in this paper to save energy consumption. Firstly, a closed-form expression for SE is derived, under the consideration of RIS phase errors. Subsequently, the energy efficiency (EE)-spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff optimization problem is proposed and modeled as a three-variable joint optimization problem. Since the problem is a non-convex fractional optimization problem and difficult to solve directly, it is decomposed into three subproblems. Next, an alternating optimization approach is introduced, leveraging the lagrangian dual reformulation (LDR) and multidimensional complex quadratic transform (MCQT). Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to deal with this complicated problem. Finally, simulation results verify the potential of PMA-based sparse RIS in enhancing EE of the system and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the design of a 3D-printed spherically-conformed anisotropic dielectric polarizer is presented for millimeter-wave vehicular communication applications in the Ka-band. The proposed polarizer is comprised of dielectric slabs shaped in spherical arrangement whose profile follows the trajectory of a loxodromic curve. As a consequence, each slab is 45° and 135° tilted to the azimuthal and polar directions of a spherical coordinate system for all spatial directions, respectively, thus ensuring the existence of the necessary anisotropy to enable linear to circular polarization conversion for linearly polar and linearly azimuthal polarized incident spherical waves. When the polarizer is illuminated by an omnidirectional linearly polarized source, the polar/azimuthal linearly polarized spherical wave is converted into a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP)/right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) spherical wave, respectively. In this study, the proposed polarizer behavior is evaluated in the Ka-band (26–40 GHz). Furthermore, an experimental design is carried out in the upper range of the Ka-band (37 GHz – 40 GHz). An omnidirectional antenna exhibiting dual linear polarization, azimuthal and polar, is used as a feed to illuminate the sphericallyconformed polarizer comprised of loxodromic dielectric slabs. Thus, the resulting emitted radiation is RHCP when the feed antenna operates in its azimuthal polarization mode, and LHCP when the feed operates in its polar polarization mode. The polarizer and the feed antenna are printed by means of distinct 3D-manufaturing techniques. The measurements are in good agreement with the simulated results.},

One of the promising countermeasures is the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with full-duplex (FD) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFm-MIMO) systems, catering to the dynamic mobility of users and limited fronthaul resources. However, the feasibility of such system is questionable. To cover this research gap, this paper presents a comprehensive outage performance analysis of the FD CFm-MIMO system, considering the impact of the realistic parameters, such as user mobility, partial channel state information (CSI), and limited fronthaul capacity. In this direction, we provide a tight approximation for the outage probability. The findings of this research underscore the pivotal role of user mobility, CSI accuracy, configuration of active RIS, users and access point antennas, and quantization parameters on the outage performance of the active RIS-assisted FD CFm-MIMO wireless system.},

Specifically, we first develop theoretical models to depict covertness, sensing, and transmission performances in terms of detection error probability (DEP), Signal-to-Noise-plus-Interference Ratio (SINR) of echo signals, and transmission outage probability (TOP), respectively. We then formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal settings of target rate and transmit powers of probing/covert signals for covert throughput maximization, subject to the constraints of DEP, SINR, TOP, and upper bound on transmit powers. By applying the alternating optimization technique to solve this optimization problem, we further derive the analytical formula for the maximum covert throughput.

To evaluate the effects of different relaying schemes, selection strategies, and system parameters on outage performance, we derive closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probability under each strategy. All analytical results are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical and simulation results indicate that system parameters significantly affect outage performance in fixed-gain relaying, whereas in CSI-assisted relaying, outage performance is primarily determined by the relay-to-vehicle link. Additionally, comparative analysis demonstrates that fixed-gain relaying achieves better outage performance, with the ORS strategy exhibiting substantial advantages over FRS and PRS.},

  abstract     = {In UAV-assisted mobile ad hoc networks (UAMANETs), UAVs' extended communication range enables remote node connections with fewer hops. However, this extension exacerbates competitive MAC resource contention under high network loads, thereby limiting the throughput. To address this challenge, we first analyze the key factors to this limitation. Our analysis reveals that the extended range of UAVs increases the number of hidden terminals by several to tens of times compared to ground nodes, resulting in an exponential increase in packet collision probability and access delay. As network load increases, the increased packet collision probability and relay delay at UAVs result in unnecessary routing hops and delays, ultimately limiting throughput. On this basis, we propose the UAV-assisted Zone Routing Protocol (UZRP), where UAVs act as both network load controllers and packet relays. All network packets are utilized by UAVs as probes for topology tomography to prune unnecessary routing hops and provide routing for nodes through computation to reduce routing convergence delay. Furthermore, UAV-generated routing packets will prevent nodes from relaying routing packets, and theoretical analysis has proven its effectiveness in reducing routing overhead. Simulation results show that UZRP achieves nearly 70% overhead reduction and 30% throughput enhancement compared to ZRP.},

To achieve this purpose, we construct a bi-objective optimization model for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and sidelobes under the constant modulus constraint. Furthermore, we generalize the model to multi-channel scenarios. Through this modeling approach, adaptive adjustment of the spectrum and sidelobes can be achieved. To solve the resulting high-order bi-objective non-convex optimization problem, we propose a manifold-based optimization algorithm. This algorithm transforms the constrained problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on the manifold space, thus avoiding approximation loss. In addition, it achieves efficient convergence by using an approximate Hessian matrix with a cautious update rule. We accelerate this algorithm using fast Fourier transform and analyze its computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in clutter suppression, sidelobe control, and computational complexity.},

For each following UAV, a novel fixed-time distributed observer is designed to estimate the time-varying state trajectory of the leader UAV within a directed topology. To effectively hunt down a target, we focus on transition from formation control to fencing control for a swarm of UAVs. A novel continuous switching function is proposed to accomplish this transition. Disturbance observers are leveraged to estimate external disturbances to tackle wind effects on the UAVs. Unmodeled dynamics are approximated by a fuzzy logic system. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the formation tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods of the origin. Thereafter, utilizing the designed control input signals from the position subsystem, an adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed to bring stability to the attitude subsystem. Finally, simulation results are offered to demonstrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been considered as a promising technology for 6 G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) allows service providers to allocate vehicle terminals (VTs) to edge servers, providing an effective paradigm for low latency computing services. In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed GUPA algorithm can effectively reduce costs and improve user experience in this system.},

Micromobility characteristics are examined across various use cases, including holding, typing, reading, watching, and gaming, analysing motion distributions, axis correlations, and directional dependencies. A non-parametric 3D Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model is developed, demonstrating the ability to replicate outage patterns when using multiple iterations. A link budget analysis of a photonically enabled THz system reveals substantial performance degradation due to micromobility, even in static holding scenarios.

Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.},

Quickest Change Detection (QCD) serves as the mechanism to detect these motion changes, collecting evidence of significant shifts and triggering the powerful LSTM to enhance prediction results. A bespoke feedback loop, another significant innovation, leverages LSTM residual errors to iteratively adjust IMM model weights, ensuring continuous adaptability across diverse motion profiles. The activation threshold, a critical derived design contribution, is optimized by jointly balancing false-alarm rate and latency, enabling precise coordination between the IMM and LSTM modules. With LSTM active only 30% of the time, Track-LITE achieves an RMSE comparable to continuous LSTM, while reducing computational load by 70%, a testament to its efficiency.

We consider a more realistic scenario where the legitimate nodes have imperfect knowledge about the eavesdroppers' locations that can intercept information through air-to-ground and ground-to-air links. Both UAVs and energy-constrained IoT device harvest energy from radio-frequency signals transmitted by a nearby power beacon. Utilizing the harvested energy, one UAV acts as an aerial relay while the other UAV broadcasts jamming signals to ensure information secrecy. In the considered system, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the time-splitting ratio, transmit powers of IoT device and UAVs, and trajectories of both UAVs. Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, energy harvesting and information causality, and UAVs' maximum velocity and flying radius. The formulated problem is non-smooth and non-convex, which we first transform into a smooth objective function without affecting its optimality. Then, we relax the eavesdropper's uncertainty constraint by using Jensen's inequality and obtain upper bound of the wiretapping rate. Further, we decompose the original optimization problem into five subproblems using a block coordinate descent algorithm and transform them into convex form via successive convex approximation. These subproblems are then solved using the convex optimization tool CVX, simplex, and subgradient descent methods. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our framework by comparing the secrecy performance with benchmark schemes in simulation results.},

However, the time-varying traffic demand and complicated satellite-ground link bring a new challenge to the effective utilization of multi-beam beam-hopping satellite resources. What's more, current beam resource allocation approaches overlook the natural asynchronous action of beam decision-making and assume to act simultaneously, resulting in the lack of cooperation between beam decisions. To tackle these challenges, we construct a satellite beam resource allocation model, taking into account illuminated cells, frequency bandwidth, power usage, and co-frequency interference. We propose a Traffic-Aware Multi-Step (TAMS) reinforcement learning algorithm for satellite resource allocation, which treats each beam as an agent and models the problem as a Markov Stackelberg game. Considering the complicated communication channel, a traffic-aware attention-based encoder is proposed to capture correlated features from the arrival traffic, traffic buffer and channel status. Simultaneously, we introduce a sequential multi-step action decoder that approximates a Stackelberg equilibrium between leader and follower beams. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach efficiently allocates beam, frequency, and power resources while adapting to time-varying traffic demands. It outperforms baseline algorithms by enhancing throughput, reducing task delay, and ensuring delay fairness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through ablation experiments and validate its generalization across different beam numbers.},

To ensure a short sparse vector constructed, we formulate the index shifting and vector shifting merging rules to resolve positional collisions arising from identical OHVs during merging. The difference between them lies in the fact that index-shifted distinct positions are correlated, whereas vector-shifted distinct positions remain independent after merging. Additionally, since the base conversion inherent in the OHVs provides a unique correspondence between the sparse vector and transmitted bits, the proposed scheme eliminates the index table used in conventional index modulation-based sparse mapping, thereby reducing the time spent on table lookup. Simulation results verify the feasibility of our proposal in the improvement of error and latency performance when a non-orthogonal codebook is given.

Although the existing wireless semantic image transmission (WSIT) schemes have made some progress in combating the “cliff effect” of performance degradation, they are still insufficient in terms of adaptivity, coding flexibility, and spectral efficiency for delivering diverse image contents in dynamic wireless channels. This paper proposes a deeply flexible joint source-channel coding (DF-JSCC) scheme and a transmission performance prediction network (PreNet) to ameliorate the overall WSIT system performance. Firstly, we incorporate a multi-channel feature fusion module (MC-FFM) into DF-JSCC to enhance the capability to capture detailed image features at different scales. Then, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to strengthen the representation of critical features by adaptively adjusting the channel weights of the image feature maps in various radio channel conditions. Finally, we introduce the PreNet, a model that achieves high-quality PSNR prediction for reconstructed images by modeling feature distribution from detail-rich feature maps and utilizing multidimensional feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with DeepJSCC-V and WITT schemes, DF-JSCC achieves PSNR improvements of at least 0.93 dB and 0.44 dB, respectively, while also reducing the resource consumption by more than 50% under the same transmission conditions, which underscores its superior performance in spectral efficiency. In addition, the PreNet has enhanced the prediction quality and robustness of the WSIT in complex environments by reducing 14% of the average prediction error.},

Improving the driving efficiency of AMTs in dumping area enables them to quickly engage in the next loading task, thereby increasing mining productivity. In practice, this specific scenario presents typical challenges: 1) numerous path intersections and overlaps lead to severe AMT conflicts; 2) spatiotemporal conflicts are difficult to resolve and easy to cause deadlocks with increasing dumping demand; 3) the motion planning model is difficult to obtain solutions in real time. To resolve these problems, this study proposes a multi-AMT cooperative motion planning framework for dumping area, where the mine's cloud platform centrally computes terminal conditions for the speed planning of each AMT to coordinate conflicts, and each AMT performs speed planning in a distributed manner to ensure driving safety. In terms of centralized computing, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model is developed, and a grouped Monte Carlo tree search (GMCTS) model, inspired by connected component analysis in graph theory, is proposed to solve the MILP model within limited iterations. Simulation experiments of real dumping areas show that the proposed method allows to avoid deadlocks and enhance AMTs' operational efficiency within desirable computation time.},

  abstract     = {Driver yawning action is a critical indicator to detect fatigue driving behavior and design advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) for intelligent vehicles. In this paper, a driver yawning recognition approach based on adaptive keyframe selection (AKS) strategy and very deep convolutional network (VDCN) is proposed. To decrease the time overhead and improve recognition accuracy, the AKS strategy is designed in a cascading manner with two stages to eliminate redundant frames. In the first stage, redundant frames are preliminarily eliminated based on the Euclidean distance (ED) in an adaptive manner. In the second stage, a special root mean square error (SRMSE) is proposed to avoid the unreasonable elimination of some representative frames in the first stage. On the basis of the selected keyframes, an improved VDCN with a Max-Ave pooling strategy is designed to recognize the yawning action. Based on the improved VDCN, the deep features which can reflect the yawning action are extracted and used to recognize the yawning action. In order to validate the performance of yawning recognition based on the AKS strategy and VDCN, several benchmarked approaches are selected as the comparison methods. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach possesses better performance in time overhead, recognition accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Uplink sensing is widely studied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the ISAC signal is transmitted by user equipment (UE), reflected by the target, and finally received by the base station (BS). Uplink sensing has the advantage of minimal modification to the communication infrastructure. The uplink signal transmitted by UE is unknown to BS. The randomness of communication data will lead to a decrease in sensing accuracy. Therefore, the reference signals are applied for uplink sensing. Deterministic sensing subcarriers inserted into the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal can serve as sensing reference signals realizing the sensing function. However, reference signals such as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS) are often equally spaced in the frequency dimension, resulting in a reduction of the maximum unambiguous range. In addition, the dedicated sensing reference signals would consume communication resources and lead to a decrease in the communication data rate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the coprime Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and index modulation-based sensing reference signal (ZC-IM-RS) for the uplink ISAC system. The indices and inserted ZC sequences of the coprime ZC-IM-RS are modulated by communication data to carry more communication information. Additionally, the coprime ZC-IM-RS follows the coprime distribution to avoid the reduction in the maximum unambiguous range. In terms of communication, the spectral efficiency of the ISAC signal with coprime ZC-IM-RS is improved. In terms of sensing, the maximum unambiguous range of the proposed coprime ZC-IM-RS is larger than that of the equally spaced reference signal. Moreover, a novel demodulation algorithm and parameter estimation algorithm for the coprime ZC-IM-RS are proposed. The simulation results show that the gain in spectral efficiency reaches 7.3%. The maximum unambiguous range of the coprime ZC-IM-RS is increased by up to 4 times compared to that of the uplink reference signal.},

The detection complexity of FTN signaling is maintained low with the aid of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based diagonalization. Furthermore, under the constraints of the total transmit power and subcarrier power ratio, we optimize power allocation by simultaneously maximizing sensing mutual information between the radar impulse response and reflected echo signals, and communication mutual information in the frequency-selective fading channel. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed FTN-based ISAC waveform is capable of enhancing the information rate compared with the conventional orthogonal counterpart while achieving a comparable sensing performance.

Secondly, a spoofing detection method based on autocorrelation of steering vectors is proposed, which identifies spoofing by detecting the amplitude or phase characteristics of the autocorrelation matrix elements. Finally, a controllable null is constructed spatially to eliminate the corresponding spoofing signal. The simulation and experimental results show that under the typical tracking loop parameters, the accuracy of spoofing detection is not less than 99.4%, and the null depth that can effectively eliminate spoofing is not less than 44 dB.},

This work establishes a theoretical foundation for RIS-assisted UAV implementation, capitalising on the passive beamforming capabilities of RIS alongside the adaptable deployment and dynamic mobility of UAVs to enhance internet-of-things (IoT) network performance. A comprehensive framework for RIS-assisted UAV IoT data collection is represented and optimised to enhance critical performance metrics, including the quantity of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. This framework is instrumental in urban IoT networks, such as smart cities, where blockages and fading channels hinder reliable communication. The optimisation strategy deploys a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to fine-tune UAV trajectories and IoT device scheduling decisions, complemented by a codebook for RIS beamforming to optimise the RIS phase shift matrix. This integrated approach addresses the ever-increasing demand for efficient data collection in wireless IoT networks, providing a scalable and reliable solution for efficient data collection under dynamic urban environments channel conditions. Simulation results show substantial improvements in system performance, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. By coordinating the RIS phase shift matrix and UAV trajectory planning, the proposed framework achieves improvements in terms of the number of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. For example, compared to baseline methods, our approach outperforms benchmark scenarios by over 50% in terms of the number of served devices.

  abstract     = {In some UAV networks (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle networks), data is sent from UAVs to a backend server through gateway UAVs in real time. To avoid a single point of failure, using multiple gateways is preferred so that a UAV can switch to another one if a gateway fails. However, we find that the combination of current routing protocols and the IP protocol stack leads to slow switching, usually over 20 seconds. In this paper, we propose a Quick Gateway Switching approach (QGSwitch) for UAV networks with multiple gateways. QGSwitch uses the Batman-adv routing protocol, a built-in module in the Linux kernel, to establish an ad hoc network. With QGSwitch, UAVs do not need to change their IP settings when a gateway fails because the switching is done at the data link layer. To reduce the delay caused by passive failure detection, QGSwitch improves neighbor discovery and its link with the routing protocol. We implement QGSwitch on Raspberry Pi computers and conduct evaluations in both indoor and outdoor environments. Results show that QGSwitch reduces the average gateway switching delay to 1.24 seconds, which is quicker than Batman-adv with 36.48 seconds and OLSR with 20.43 seconds. It also outperforms both baselines in terms of packet loss and throughput.},

Due to the changes in the propagation characteristics of the wireless environments, a radio map model learned under a particular wireless environment cannot be directly used in a new wireless environment. Moreover, learning a new model for every environment requires, in general, a large amount of data and is computationally demanding. In this work, we design an effective novel data-driven transfer learning method that transfers and fine-tunes a deep neural network (DNN)-based radio map model learned from an original indoor wireless environment to other indoor environments with a certain level of similarity. Since other widely used similarity measures do not consider the wireless propagation characteristics, we design a data-driven similarity measure that predicts the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated power values and the amount of training data needed when learning a radio map in a new environment. Extensive simulations over several wireless environments of both office and cafe area environments show that the proposed method achieves savings of approximately 40-90% in sensor measurement data while maintaining similar accuracy (MSE) as a model trained without transfer learning, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), mobile vehicle clients can employ Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train an AI model in a distributed manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of IoV. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, they may move out the coverage of edge server before completing local model training, making it difficult to upload their local models for aggregation on time. Furthermore, lazy vehicles with low-quality data or non-action contribute minimally to the global model while consuming system resources. These factors severely degrade the robustness and accuracy of FL. To mitigate the adverse effects, it's essential for the success of FL systems to select suitable vehicle clients based on the data quality and mobility. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware reputation-based vehicle client selection scheme (MoReCS), where edge servers in a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architecture dynamically select suitable vehicle clients based on real-time mobility information and reputation. Experimental results in mobile scenarios demonstrate that MoReCS effectively reduces the impact of vehicle mobility on model training and further enhances accuracy through the integration of a reputation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental objective of the forthcoming sixth-generation wireless networks is to concurrently serve a vast array of devices many of which, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, are projected to have low power requirements or even operate in a passive manner. To achieve this goal, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are regarded as two pivotal and promising technologies. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework for studying the reliability and security of uplink NOMA-based AmBC systems. Specifically, closed-form analytical expressions for both NOMA-users' and IoT backscatter devices' (BDs') outage probabilities (OPs) are derived for both cases of perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Building upon these expressions, analytical results for system's sum throughput as well as energy efficiency are developed for the performance evaluation purposes. In addition, assuming that one NOMA-user transmits an artificial noise in order to enhance system's security, the physical layer security (PLS) of the system is investigated by extracting analytical expressions for NOMA-users' and BD's intercept probabilities (IPs). To gain insightful understandings, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by focusing on the high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which reveals that NOMA-users and BDs face outage floors in the high SNR regime as well as that IPs reach constant values at high SNR. Additionally, practical insights regarding how different system parameters affect these OP floors and IP constant values are extracted. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the developed theoretical framework, offer performance comparisons between the presented NOMA-based AmBC system and conventional benchmarks, and reveal the impact of different system parameters on the reliability, security and energy efficiency of NOMA-based AmBC networks.},

  abstract     = {Human drivers possess spatial and causal intelligence, enabling them to perceive driving scenarios, anticipate hazards, and react to dynamic environments. In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for the SOTIF domain in autonomous driving. The dataset and related resources are available at github.com/s95huang/DriveSOTIF.git},

Despite the existence of various UAV formation strategies, current approaches struggle with slow convergence, limited scalability, and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a UAV formation model based on Sierpinski's fractal, designed to meet the specific requirements of formation gathering and rapid separation. Our approach integrates heterogeneous information and a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enhanced with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and an attention mechanism, to optimize cluster control strategies. Moreover, we introduce a novel G-MIXDDPG algorithm based on Sierpinski fractals, which improves convergence speed and adapts to a larger number of agents. Experiments demonstrate that G-MIXDDPG achieves a 63.13%, 21.63%, and 19.71% higher aggregation success rate compared to DDPG, MADDPG, and MATD3, respectively, and reduces aggregation time by 8s and 25s compared to back-stepping and MPC methods.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is considered as a technology capable of artificially modify the wireless channel, then the communication performance might be improved in terms of the coverage and the signal strength. Most studies focus on the omni-directional communication systems operating in the sub-6 GHz band and assume that the RIS can be fully illuminated. However, in future highly directional millimeter-wave communication systems, the beamwidth emitted by the base station (BS) is very narrow, and only a part of the RIS elements, instead of full of them, will be illuminated. As a result, the signal power and the RIS reflected beamwidth will decrease. In addition, random failures of RIS units may introduce phase shift errors, which will degrade the received signal power. To address these problems, in this paper, the RIS illuminated area will be optimized through rotation. Specifically, the illuminated area as a function of the rotation angle is explicitly analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the optimal rotation angle and the critical rotation angle are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, which demonstrate that, the received signal power can be improved. The RIS reflected beamwidth can be increased to four times compared to its original size in our simulation setup, while maintaining the same received power, thus allowing an enlarged receiving area.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned industrial vehicles are prone to dynamic instability during emergency obstacle avoidance. Variations in multi-dimensional stability over time pose significant challenges to both collision avoidance and stability control, resulting in hesitation and conservatism in vehicle decisions, similar to those of human drivers. This paper analyzes the avoidance distance within the context of multidimensional stability boundaries and proposes a framework that integrates high-level behavioral decision-making with low-level motion tracking. First, the pure braking distance and safety distance are calculated considering the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral stability. A terminal constraints-based optimization method is then employed to account for the diverse motion states of surrounding vehicles during the motion planning of the ego vehicle. Additionally, the multi-objective optimization problem of obstacle avoidance is reformulated as a control problem with well-defined objectives. Then, the performance of super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) and model predictive control (MPC) across different obstacle avoidance distances is subsequently compared. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The results demonstrate that the decisionmaking planner, based on avoidance distance, provides collisionfree navigation for industrial vehicles in complex scenarios. It also accurately categorizes obstacle avoidance challenges, significantly enhancing both vehicle stability during avoidance and the computational efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at 10−2 uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of 10−4 with rate-1/2 coding.},

This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-exemplar class incremental learning approach and its application to traffic sign classification through systematic analysis. From an empirical standpoint, it reveals that concept drift is the crucial cause of the failure of distillation-based methods and the restriction in feature space can provide stable prototypes used as an anchor in the proposed prototype distillation loss. To make better trade-off between stability and plasticity of a deep neural network, this work proposes three components: prototype distillation, postrebalancing, and contrastive loss minimization to enhance training strategy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed training method obtains superior performance over it as well as other state-of-the-art exemplarfree methods. In some settings, it can even outperform some replay-based algorithms and better mitigate the problem of expanding the model's capacity in traffic application scenarios.},

To meet stringent end-to-end delay and energy consumption requirements, users can offload tasks to edge servers where relevant services are pre-cached. However, the limited storage capacity and the heterogeneity of edge nodes make collaborative cache decision-making and computing resource allocation at the edge critical challenges. We address the optimization of task offloading, resource allocation, service caching, and push decisions within the MEC system through the coordinated efforts of edge servers. The objective is to minimize long-term offloading latency while maximizing the cache hit ratio, presenting a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel soft actor-critic approach, transforming the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP).

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.},

These systems, known for their low latency due to their proximity to Earth, incorporate advanced developments in payload and antenna technologies including adaptive radio resource management and beam forming capabilities. The study investigates key issues in multi-beam satellite systems, including beam footprint design, user-to-beam assignments, and the optimal distribution of radio resources. We introduce a novel problem aimed at optimizing beam placement and balancing user loads in Non-GSO satellite systems, which results in a mixed-integer non-convex formulation. For practically appealing applications, we relax the binary variables and propose the continuous relaxation problem using the inner convex approximation framework and a penalty method to further speed up the convergence. The proposed method addresses a complex, previously unexplored non-convex and NP-hard optimization problem, offering a practical and efficient polynomial-time solution. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements over existing benchmarks and providing new insights into the optimization of satellite communication systems},

  abstract     = {With intelligence becoming a key trend in the evolution of high-speed railway (HSR) systems, the demand for computational resources from various onboard devices continues to grow. While cloud computing enhances the computational capacity of onboard equipment, it also introduces long transmission latency and exacerbates core network congestion. Edge computing has emerged as a promising solution to reduce transmission latency and relieve the burden on core networks by offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge servers located near the data source. However, the high mobility of trains introduces substantial challenges. Offloading tasks may be disrupted when a train exits the coverage area of its serving edge server, leading to task failures and service interruptions. Moreover, the short execution window of tasks and the dynamic variability of available computational resources further increase the risk of task re-execution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mobility-aware dynamic task offloading and migration framework tailored for high-speed rail transit environments. Specifically, a dynamic feature attention mechanism (DFAM) is employed to predict future train trajectories and estimate the time at which the train will depart the current edge server's coverage zone. Using the predicted trajectory, a predictive deep deterministic policy gradient (P-DDPG) algorithm is developed, integrating computational resource awareness and a dynamic noise adjustment strategy to enable rapid and adaptive offloading and migration decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces task execution latency and improves offloading reliability compared to conventional schemes.},

The BFC problem entails dividing all nodes in the NMSV into two subnetworks that create formation-containment configurations. The nodes in the leader subnetwork (LSN) create two contrasting formation shapes influenced by cooperative and antagonistic interactions at specific finite time, with the centers of these shapes following the positive and negative trajectories of the target. Moreover, the nodes in the follower subnetwork (FSN) can connect exclusively with one another or with the LSN to converge into the appropriate follower containment shapes. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical finitetime fuzzy control (HFTFC) algorithm is proposed, integrating fuzzy logic rules and finite-time adaptive laws to tackle the challenges outlined above. Using the Lyapunov function, several sufficient conditions for stability analysis are derived to guarantee the stabilization of the designed HFTFC algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the position error and velocity error of the vehicles approach near-zero values within a finite time frame. These quantitative metrics validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided ISCC systems, where an RIS can provide additional spatial degree of freedom. To this end, we first formulate a joint beamforming problem for RIS-aided ISCC, aiming to concurrently improve the performance for multiple target sensing, multi-dimensional computation, and multi-stream communication. Then we propose two joint beamforming algorithms: one is weight performance optimization (WPO) algorithm that minimizes total mean square error (MSE) of various demands under power constraints, while the other one is latency minimization and power management (LMPM) algorithm that reduces total power consumption and transmission latency, keeping the sensing MSE within a specified limit. In addition, we analyze the impact of key system parameters on the overall performance of ISCC, providing valuable guidelines for practical system design. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated by the simulation, which shows that the sensing error of WPO algorithm is reduced by at least 46.7% compared with the existing popular algorithms, while the computation rate and communication rate are increased by more than 49.1% and 22.2%, respectively.

To solve these challenges, this paper constructs a communication-efficient CPPA (CE-CPPA) scheme based on ring signature in VANETs. With the transformation of the signature format and employment of the non-interactive sum argument technique, a logarithmic-size signature is realized by CE-CPPA, improving the communication efficiency. Meanwhile, by devising the concise tag containing information about the event and real signer, CE-CPPA realizes traceability and linkability simultaneously. Furthermore, the certificate management and key escrow problems are eliminated combining with certificateless cryptography. Rigorous security analysis indicates that CE-CPPA not only achieves unforgeability and anonymity but also meets the necessary security requirements. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that our CE-CPPA is feasible and efficient enough for VANETs security-related applications.},

Moreover, inspired by the pilot structure in recent works, a new low-overhead pilot scheme is introduced which is capable of effectively capturing the channel's temporal variations and enhancing the estimation performance of the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed 2D DPS-BEM CE method is evaluated by deriving the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound, which shows a low estimation error.

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables large-scale data collection but suffers from excessive resource consumption due to repetitive sensing operations. By introducing edge caching capabilities, MCS systems can significantly reduce redundant data collection through caching re-use. However, this introduces a fundamental challenge: how to balance sensing cost efficiency and data freshness in cache-enabled MCS systems, where stale cached data may compromise application performance while frequent re-sensing wastes resources. To address this challenge, we investigate the balance between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in MCS networks, aiming to minimize the system latency while ensuring the freshness of cached task information. To this end, we formulate a weighted sum of latency and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, aiming to propose a comprehensive framework that jointly optimizes sensing decisions, user selection, data size and subchannel allocation, along with a caching strategy. To tackle this non-convex and mixed-integer programming problem, we first decompose the original long-term optimization problem into multiple one-shot sub-problems. For each one-shot problem, we reformulate it as a system latency minimization sub-problem to determine the optimal solution under the assumption of task re-sensing. The system latency is then compared with the AoI value to determine task sensing decisions. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian caching algorithm to optimize cache utilization. Building upon these, a time-efficient algorithm is proposed for the long-term optimization problem considering temporal correlations. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our proposed solution achieves a bounded optimality gap compared to the offline optimal solution. Furthermore, extensive simulation results validate that our method significantly outperforms various baseline schemes.},

Typically, multiple UAVs collaboratively execute IoT applications, such as smart disaster management and smart traffic monitoring, using locally trained machine learning (ML) models in UaaS platform. In such cases, model contamination arises from inaccurate data collection due to faulty sensors, adverse weather, or UAV malfunctions, severely degrading model performance. On the other hand, existing approaches transmit all data and models to a central server, incurring significant communication latency and overhead, limiting responsiveness in time-sensitive applications. MitiCon addresses these challenges by enabling UAVs to transmit only their locally trained models and a small, representative subset of data – termed ValiData – to the central server. A scaled voting mechanism evaluates ValiData's trustworthiness, and a novel TrustLoss metric identifies contaminated models. Further, a softmax-based aggregation strategy then combines UAV machine learning models, giving greater weight to validated models as more reliable. We rigorously evaluate the performance of MitiCon. We observe that MitiCon significantly enhances model robustness and accuracy while reducing latency. Compared to existing methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, MitiCon achieves up to 17% and 27% higher accuracy and converges in 60% fewer communication rounds.},

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction, denoted as the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Interaction-aware Transformer Network (DSTIFormer). The three main parts of the DSTIFormer architecture are a spatial-temporal embedding module, a spatial-temporal dynamics interaction-aware module, and a trajectory encoderdecoder module. The spatial-temporal embedding module aims to encode vehicular trajectory interactions into latent representations that simultaneously preserve spatial dependencies and temporal features. The second module utilizes a temporal transformer network (TTN) along with a spatial graph transformer network (STN) to capture the dynamic spatial-temporal interactions between vehicles. To make trajectory predictions more accurate, the third module uses a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture as the encoder and an attention-based decoder layer to effectively extract the long-range sequential dependencies in the process. The model's prediction accuracy with the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric on two publicly available datasets: NGSIM and HighD, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several benchmark methods in long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {The social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) is promoting the deep integration of social networks into IoV systems, emphasizing the social communications and structures of cloud-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle socialization. Towards secure SIoV message classification, the methodology of certificateless public key encryption with equality test (CL-PKEET) is adopted. Nonetheless, existing solutions typically address threats only from either the vehicle side or the social cloud server side. Specifically, a vehicle may obtain private information via performing unauthorized public equality retrieval; and the cloud may launch message recovery attacks via exhaustively testing potential guessing messages. To simultaneously address threats from both sides, we present Flamer, a secure SIoV message classification system with Flexible-authorization that resists message recovery attacks. Technically, we revisit the dual-server architecture and roughly combine the flexible authorization mechanism into CL-PKEET. Beside presenting formal construction and security analysis, we implement state-of-the-art solutions and Flamer in real cloud environment. Extensive experiments under public dataset, along with network and traffic simulations, are conducted to confirm the practical performance of Flamer. It outperforms state-ofthe-art solutions by running 1.2× ∼ 1.58× faster for message classification, across the corresponding four authorization types with time efficiency improvements ranging from 1.84× to 5.5×.},

Splitting users' messages into common and private streams exposes them to eavesdropping, with the common stream dedicated for sensing and accessible to multiple users. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to enhance the security of RSMA-enabled ISAC. Specifically, we first derive the ergodic private secrecy rate (EPSR) based on a mathematical approximation of the average Eve channel gain. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the minimum EPSR, while satisfying the minimum required thresholds on the ergodic common secrecy rate, the radar sensing and the RIS power budget. To address this non-convex problem, a novel optimization strategy is developed, whereby we alternatively optimize the transmit beamforming matrix for the common and private streams, rate splitting, AN, RIS reflection coefficient matrix, and radar receive beamformer. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and Majorization-Minimization (MM) are employed to convexify the beamforming and RIS sub-problems.

Given cost constraints that lead to insufficient computational capabilities in robots, they can offload computation-intensive tasks to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers via satellite-ground network, substantially improving their efficiency in real-world task execution. However, robots' mobility causes their positions relative to MEC servers to change continuously, resulting in dynamically evolving computing offloading environments. To address this issue, this paper aims to ensure the efficiency of multiple robots jointly completing a complex real-world task and at the same time minimize the average completion time of the robot's computing task. We consider a scenario in which multiple robots move to multiple target locations, where the destination of each robot is not assigned in advance. The robots need to move to one of the target locations individually, and at the same time, their own computing tasks can be offloaded to base stations or satellites around them. We conceptualize this problem as a multi-objective optimization framework, which is decoupled into two components: movement control and computation offloading, and propose the DAOMAN algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method minimizes the time for robots to reach their respective targets while also reducing the completion time of their computation tasks.},

This method leverages Doppler shifts in the signals transmitted between ground users and fast-moving LEO satellites for precise localization. Initially, we formulate the signal reception model and analyze the operating principles of RARs, highlighting their inherent low-noise superiority over traditional antennas. To fully harvest the low-noise property of RARs, we develop an efficient and fidelity-robust Levenberg-Marquardt particle filter (LM-PF) algorithm for the joint localization using multiple RAR-equipped LEO satellites. Finally, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both the RAR-based and RF-based localization methods, which quantitatively characterize the performance gains offered by the low-noise property of RARs. Simulation results show that, when the transmit power is merely 7 dBm, where traditional antennas struggle to recover the precise user location, the RAR-based LEO localization can still achieve an error less than 10 meters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel Real-Time Kinematic positioning architecture with Enhanced Velocity Constraints (RTK-EVC) which is solved by factor graph optimization. The RTK procedure has been redesigned, which consists of three phases: the velocity estimation, the position estimation and the Partial Ambiguity Resolution (PAR) augmented by the Dead Reckoning (DR) consistency check. The velocity estimation, which provides high-accuracy velocity information to construct velocity constraints, is connected with the position estimation sequentially when they are used for calculating the float solution. The DR consistency check is proposed to enhance the reliability of the PAR. A dual-part factor graph architecture is designed for FGO-RTK. The whole factor graph is divided to the velocity factor graph and position factor graph which are solved sequentially to prepare velocities for velocity constraints in position estimation. In the velocity estimation, RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) Doppler-shift quality control constant velocity hypothesis factors and constant acceleration hypothesis factors are implemented to formulate a robust and accurate velocity estimator. In the position estimation, velocity-independent constraint factors are employed for decoupling the estimation of velocity from position. Fixed prior factors are designed to maintain the high precision information of the historical fixed epochs. As for the PAR augmented by the DR consistency check, the fixed solution, which has passed the conventional ratio test, is further checked by the DR results from the historical fixed epochs. The new architecture is evaluated by both open-source dataset and fresh experimental dataset. It is demonstrated that the RTK-EVC architecture can outperform current open-source methods in GNSS-challenged environments. Different strategies in the RTK-EVC architecture are also comparatively analyzed. The C++ implementation of the RTK-EVC and the new dataset can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/RTK-EVC.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08% and 8.55% in accuracy for the few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks, respectively.},

By utilizing the sparse path and beam aggregation properties of mmWave communications, the equivalent channel can be modeled as a multi-dimensional block-sparse matrix. This modeling is achieved in the code-time-frequency (CTF)-angle domain through segment-based compressed coding. The joint channel estimation and segment data recovery is then achieved using a pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PCSBL) with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. A clustering method based on similar channel features is proposed to concatenate different data segments. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating a 6 dB increase in energy efficiency compared to tree-based coded compressed sensing (CCS) scheme.},

A key feature of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is its dynamic data size, which poses challenges in incentivizing consistent user participation. Unlike traditional contracts where the contract is the same for all global training round, our design specifies the required amount of data along with the corresponding reward for each global training round. We introduce a data bound reflecting the data accumulation rate and study two scenarios: uniform data bound (same for all users) and non-uniform data bound (vary by user). For uniform data bounds, we show that monotonicity holds, simplifying individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints. However, for non-uniform data bounds, monotonicity is violated. To address this, we propose an algorithm for non-uniform data bounds, reducing the complexity of contract design. To design the contract, we maximize the server's utility, defined as the accuracy minus the total payment, subject to individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC), while considering data bounds. Through extensive simulations, we have validated IR and IC constraints for all types of users in every global training round. We observe that 1) the server increases data requirements as data accumulates for each type, 2) payments grow with user effort, 3) our dynamic contract model significantly outperforms existing static contract, and 4) the proposed algorithm effectively handles the complexities of non-uniform data bounds, making it a robust solution for dynamic contract design.},

However, optimising task offloading and resource allocation poses significant challenges due to the AVs' constrained battery life and limited processing capacity. To tackle this, we propose a unified framework integrating Optimal Stopping Theory (OST), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). OST determines the optimal offloading checkpoint, while DDPG dynamically optimises resource allocation to minimise energy consumption and ensure rapid responsiveness for realtime autonomous operations. Additionally, GA enhances MEC efficiency by optimising the execution order in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be offloaded. Simulation results show that OST improves offloading performance by at least 9.4% compared to conventional strategies. The DDPG-based approach reduces vehicle energy consumption by at least 24.7%, while the GA method decreases queue waiting times by 67.6% and reduces failed offloading tasks by 20%. This framework effectively balances energy efficiency and task latency while ensuring reliable and responsive AV operations in the MEC-assisted vehicular network.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles at high speeds are prone to losing control due to the initial impact, which can potentially lead to more severe secondary collisions. An effective post-impact control (PIC) strategy can restore the vehicle's stability after the initial collision, reducing the risk of secondary collisions. This paper proposes a robust four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) PIC strategy that is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL); it is capable of automatically adapting to different road adhesion conditions. To our best knowledge, this paper presents the first real-world experimental validation of a DRL-based PIC strategy. We propose an 8-DOF vehicle collision dynamics model to construct a reinforcement learning training environment, and design a reward function to guide the agent in controlling the vehicle to return to its target path and achieve a safe yaw angle. We randomize a specific parameter in the tire model to simulate different road adhesion conditions and enhance the robustness. The PIC strategy can restore the vehicle's post-impact stability under different speeds and road adhesion conditions, reduce lateral post-impact errors, and return the vehicle to a safe yaw angle, further lowering the risk of secondary collisions. The model's validity was confirmed by comparing the dynamic responses of the proposed model with those of the CarSim model. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed PIC strategy were further verified on the CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink joint simulation platform. And experiments were conducted using a specially developed down-scaled vehicle to validate the feasibility and real-time performance of the proposed PIC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, traffic signals have played a crucial role in urban intersection control. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), traffic control at intersections can be further enhanced through the precise planning of CAV trajectories. In this article, we propose a vehicle-group-based traffic control approach to optimize both signal timing and vehicle trajectories in mixed traffic environments with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This approach builds upon centralized traffic control approaches, while incorporating the merits of decentralized vehicle control methods. A two-stage optimization framework is proposed. In the first stage, signal timing is optimized considering all vehicles in the control area. To address computational issues, a dynamic programming algorithm with a greedy assignment strategy is designed. In the second stage, vehicles are organized into vehicle groups with CAVs leading HDVs. The CAV trajectories are optimized at the group level. The concept of vehicle group does not require strict leader-follower relationships or designated cruising states, thus enhancing the flexibility in implementation at intersections. To account for the stochastic nature of HDV behaviors, an implementation framework for both traffic signal and vehicles is designed, incorporating an asynchronous receding horizon control scheme and multiple execution modes. Comprehensive comparative experiments have been conducted involving the proposed method and eight different baselines, across a wide range of scenarios, including varying traffic demands, different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs, as well as various levels of randomness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of vehicle delay and fuel consumption, but also demonstrate that it can achieve coordination among vehicles, leading to improved performance compared to decentralized vehicle control, while enhancing computational efficiency in comparison with centralized control methods.},

  abstract     = {Time-sensitive networks (TSN), as an emerging technology, are designed to fulfill the need for low-latency and deterministic data transmission in areas such as drones and Industry 4.0. To simplify the computation of scheduling plans in TSN, the cyclic queue forwarding (CQF) mechanism is introduced to efficiently schedule time-triggered (TT) flows in TSN. However, these studies have generally neglected the impact of routing on scheduling and the importance of intratimeslot resource allocation for optimal flow scheduling. To this end, this paper proposes a joint routing-optimized scheduling strategy aimed at enhancing the schedulability of TT flows. This paper also designs an adaptive time slot segmentation (ATSS) mechanism, which improves resource utilization by grouping flows of different sizes and dynamically allocating resources within each time slot based on the amount of data in each group. In order to combine the ATSS mechanism with joint routing co-optimization scheduling for optimal scheduling of TT flows, a heuristic algorithm based on scoring of pathoffset pair is designed in this paper. The algorithm selects the optimal routes and offsets by scoring the path-offset pair of each time-sensitive data flow to maximize the schedulability of TT flows. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms in different simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the designed algorithm improves the scheduling success rate and resource utilization, ensures link load balancing, has acceptable computational overhead, and has good scalability to adapt to networks of different sizes.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling artificial intelligence (AI) applications with stringent latency requirements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the inherent mobility of vehicles, leading to limited residence time, dynamic wireless transmissions, and a time-varying candidate set, degrades the FL training efficiency. Moreover, the convergence rate of FL model suffers from the heterogeneity issues among vehicles. Due to constrained spectrum resources and high connecting density, client scheduling is essential for FL to mitigate network burdens and enhance learning performance. In this paper, we propose a client scheduling scheme based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that selects effective and high-quality clients for the FL within IoV. In detail, we consider a FL-assisted IoV scenario and construct a candidate client pool based on a mobility model, representing moving vehicles on a unidirectional lane. In this context, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the overall FL training latency while ensuring model accuracy under constrained resources. Considering the low complexity and scalability of MAB, we reformulate the optimization problem and design a reward function that jointly considers the training latency per round and the contribution of local data for reducing the overall latency. To estimate the contribution of local data on global aggregation, we introduce a utility function based on training loss of local datasets in the MAB reward function. Finally, an ε-greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation within the dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our lightweight and effective scheme outperforms existing approaches in reducing training time and accelerating convergence to the target accuracy. The results confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively address dynamicity and heterogeneity challenges under constrained resources of FL within IoV.},

Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as energy harvesting and information causality, UAVs' collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, etc. Considering the system dynamics, we reformulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process and solve it with a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Specifically, the SAC agent learns an optimal policy by observing time-varying channel gains and spatial randomness of homogeneous Poisson point process eavesdroppers.

  abstract     = {In the delay line based, sub-Nyquist approach to estimate frequencies of radar signals spanning several GHz (say, 2 to 18 GHz), especially for electronic warfare applications, the frequency is estimated from the phase difference between the aliased components of the original signal and a delayed version of the same. This method, however, implicitly assumes the delay employed to be accurately known, though, in practice, no delay (especially analog delay) is free from error that is usually frequency dependent and not known a priori. Since the operating frequency is in the GHz range, even a small error in the delay employed can give rise to significant error in the frequency estimate. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two delay line based approach where the shorter delay line produces a so-called coarse estimate of the frequency and the longer delay line treats it as a reference to produce more accurate coarse and later fine estimates. Analysis, however, shows that for delay errors of larger magnitudes, the lower limit of employable sampling rate increases in this approach. To address this, we propose a multiple delay line model where the delay values of a set of parallel delay lines are gradually increased, with each $k$-th delay line determining its coarse estimate by using the coarse estimate of the $(k-1)$-th delay line as reference, and fine estimation is carried out at the end from the longest delay line. The paper also discusses ways of optimizing the throughput and the number of delay lines in the multiple delay line set up.},

Conventional deep learning approaches typically depend on extensive labeled datasets, which are scarce in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, a convolutional-transformer hybrid network based on self-supervised contrastive learning (CTNet-SSCL) is proposed for RSMR. In self-supervised contrastive pre-training, an amplitude distortion data augmentation technique is proposed, which enables the model to effectively utilize unlabeled data, allowing it to learn meaningful feature representations. Subsequently, the pre-trained multi-scale perceptual transformer (MSPFormer) encoder, combined with a randomly initialized classifier, is fine-tuned using labeled samples. The encoder combines multi-scale feature fusion and time-frequency attention mechanisms to further enhance the robustness and recognition accuracy of the model in complex environments. The excellent performance of the proposed method is verified in experiments on a dataset with 10 different waveforms. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99.98% at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB. The source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wanan0414/CTNet-SSL.},

An extended 4 × 4 Butler matrix topology based on digital phase shifters (PSs) is proposed and the relationship between digital PSs and phase differences of the sequenced ports are derived and discussed with arbitrary phase difference couplers. With these derived equations, the extended Butler matrix with more phase differences can be achieved by changing the value of the PSs. The design concept is demonstrated by a Butler matrix composed of four transformer-based couplers and four PSs based on open-/short-circuit microstrip line-loaded slotline. Due to the avoidance of additional phase shifting structures, the proposed Butler matrix size is very compact. In addition, the design of couplers is no longer limited to 90° couplers, which improves the flexibility of design. The proposed Butler matrix is then fabricated and tested, and the measured results agree with the simulated results within the operating band from 3 to 4 GHz, i.e., 28.6% in fraction. To illustrate the enhanced beam controllability of the design, a multibeam system is further proposed and developed based on a 1 × 4 patch antenna array fed by the extended Butler matrix. As experimentally confirmed, 16 switchable beams are realized with an equivalent half-power beamwidth of 98° and a widened spatial coverage. As a result, the proposed multibeam antenna has been confirmed and can be potentially employed for the miniaturization of the whole communication system for vehicular applications.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), composed of low-cost passive components, offer a promising approach for enhancing energy and spectral efficiency in future wireless networks. However, accurate channel estimation and beamforming design remain challenging, particularly in near-field scenarios. Existing channel estimation methods, such as LS, LMMSE, compressed sensing, matrix factorization, and deep learning, often suffer from high pilot overhead, reliance on channel sparsity, scaling ambiguities, or excessive model complexity. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-based framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where the near-field channel is formulated as a function of low-dimensional channel parameters. This reduces both training overhead and computational complexity. The maximum likelihood algorithm based on deep unfolding (MLADU) is developed to estimate these channel parameters. During the channel estimation process, we construct a deep residual learning denoising network (DRLD) to eliminate noise from the received pilot signals. The estimation parameters are then directly used to guide joint beamforming design, enabling cooperative beamforming optimization of both the base station (BS) and RIS. On the basis of fully recovering the channel parameters, we propose a digital/analog hybrid beamforming optimization algorithm based on deep unfolding (HBADU) to maximize the sum rate of users. The simulation results demonstrate that during the channel estimation phase, the proposed MLADU enhances the accuracy of channel estimation. In the beamforming optimization phase, the proposed HBADU effectively utilizes the estimated channel parameters to achieve superior communication performance, while exhibiting faster convergence. Additionally, the results confirm that the inclusion of RIS enhances overall system performance.},

Focusing on ensuring reliable access for massive users in high-dynamic satellite environments, we propose a novel random access (RA) preamble design and detection scheme incorporating orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Specifically, a RA preamble utilizing block-cyclic Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences is developed by arranging multiple single-root ZC sequences in the delay-Doppler domain with strategically configured cyclic shift sets. In particular, our design not only ensures substantial preamble capacity and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), but also facilitates multi-user detection without being affected by non-orthogonal interference. By leveraging the characteristics of the proposed preamble, we introduce an effective three-stage preamble detection algorithm for accurate user identification and timing advance estimation. Moreover, we conduct theoretical derivations to analyze the impacts of preamble design parameters on the PAPR and detection performance of our scheme. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible tradeoff between PAPR and preamble capacity by adapting the number of sequences, and significantly outperforms the existing approach in terms of the successful detection probability in typical LEO satellite scenarios.},
