  abstract     = {Accurately estimating battery state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle applications (EVs) is crucial to ensure a safe and reliable vehicle operation. However, robust SOC estimation under all possible operating conditions is challenging due to varying load conditions, varying and non-linear battery impedance, sensor inaccuracies, among others. Meanwhile, battery management systems (BMS) are trending toward more compact designs to enhance reliability by reducing wiring and boosting energy density. Hence, minimizing the memory footprint of SOC estimation algorithms is a key challenge, as their design and tuning remain a time-consuming and costly process for the industry. This paper introduces an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) algorithm with a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. The first stage role is to find the equivalent circuit parameters’ optimal values in a non-SOC-dependent manner. The second GA optimizes the initial AEKF model tuning parameters. To mitigate the randomness of the GA, an algorithm is designed to automatically determine the optimum set of parameters with minimal user intervention. Finally, to avoid calibrating the AEKF to a Coulomb counter, the obtained parameters were tested locally and using an online tool to ensure the robustness of the estimator. The described algorithm achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7% to 2% across various positive and negative temperatures under several drive conditions. With this tool, the AEKF can be rapidly tuned with minimal user effort, providing fast and robust SOC estimation suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare. However, its adoption is hindered by the technical-proficiency gap, the disconnect between AI complexity and clinical interpretability. Although Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) techniques aim to address this gap, fragmented research limits the development of generalizable and practical guidance. In response, we introduce FIXAIH, a dynamic, evidence-based framework that consolidates fragmented research in XAI and IML into a coherent structure to guide implementation in healthcare. It is designed to enhance the transparency, accountability, and efficacy of AI systems -- characteristics essential to meet trust and legal requirements, e.g., in the EU AI Act. FIXAIH uses a machine learning-based methodology to holistically analyze literature to identify key parameters shaping the integration of XAI and IML in clinical contexts. We develop a BERT-based tool and examine 5,083 articles, identifying 13 key parameters across three macro-parameters: Research Methods, Health Disorders, and Disease Prevention. This categorization, refined through review of 200+ studies, clarifies applications, trends, and challenges in healthcare XAI. These parameters serve as design elements for developing and aligning AI systems. Drawing on them, FIXAIH supports diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and risk prediction through, e.g., feature relevance, bias detection, model refinement, data preparation, and expert-guided adjustments. FIXAIH embeds this methodology and adaptable guidelines at its core, evolving as new evidence becomes available, with the intention to expand through integration of social media, clinical insights, regulatory data, and other sources. This adaptive design supports continuous learning and practical implementation, promoting a trustworthy approach to medical innovation.},

To address limitations of existing methods in small-target detection (e.g., 0.08%-area isolating switches), imbalanced component distribution (<10 samples for rare components), and joint topology-text parsing, this work proposes an intelligent framework integrating enhanced YOLO11 with CAD parsing. Key contributions include: an adaptive sliding window mechanism for small-target recognition, hierarchical feature fusion with CBAM attention to distinguish geometrically similar elements, and a DXF spatial rule engine for connection extraction. Evaluations on real-world grid datasets achieve 93.6% mAP@50 (21.1-point improvement over baseline YOLO11), 86% rare-component recognition, 100% text extraction accuracy, 99.4% connection accuracy, and 5.2s/image processing (3.04× faster than conventional approaches). This framework enables comprehensive collaborative parsing of 28 component categories with topological relationships, providing effective technical support for power system digitalization.},

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance on user reviews for decision-making has elevated the role of online reviews on e-commerce platforms, yet the surge in generic, vague, or promotional content undermines their informativeness and credibility. While existing sentiment analysis and fake review detection methods classify reviews based on polarity or authenticity, they often overlook a critical dimension: how informative and actionable a review truly is. Reviews such as “Great place!” may indicate positive sentiment but lack specific, aspect-level insights needed by consumers or businesses. This deficiency creates a substantial gap in current review analysis systems, which struggle to differentiate between superficial and detailed feedback. Addressing this gap requires an approach capable of capturing both the presence and richness of aspect-specific content. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven approach for evaluating the informativeness of restaurant reviews by integrating linguistic analysis with Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. The KG is constructed using restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset to define aspect categories, extract aspect terms, and model their corresponding sentiment relations. The proposed approach systematically identifies and extracts aspect-sentiment pairs related to four critical aspects: food, service, price, and atmosphere, using dependency parsing and a curated lexicon. A custom metric, Aspect-Aware Length-Normalized Information Density (Aspect-Aware LNID), is introduced to quantify the richness and completeness of a review based on its semantic content and aspect coverage. Experimental evaluation on the SemEval 2014 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a 97.5% weighted-average F1-score in aspect category extraction and providing interpretable, scalable, and domain-specific insights. This hybrid approach offers a transparent alternative to opaque deep learning models, enabling fine-grained opinion mining and improved consumer trust in online review platforms.},

  abstract     = {The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on smart grid infrastructures have raised critical concerns over data integrity, operational resilience, and real-time response capabilities. This study introduces a unified cybersecurity framework for cyber-physical power systems that integrate high-performance anomaly detection with provably secure cryptographic protection. A comprehensive dataset, built upon the IEEE 24-bus test system, includes a diverse set of operational states and five classes of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealthy and replay-based intrusions. To accurately detect both common and sophisticated threats, we implement a suite of supervised learning models—RF, MLP, and Decision Trees—alongside an ensemble strategy termed MVCC, which achieves up to 99.90% accuracy in binary classification and 99.88% in multiclass settings. For defense at the data level, we deploy a two-tier encryption architecture combining AES-GCM (for confidentiality and authenticity) with RSA-OAEP (for secure key management), demonstrating strong resilience against standard attack models (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA) and achieving nearly uniform ciphertext entropy (7.99 bits/byte). The system’s real-time applicability is validated through the deployment of the RF classifier on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform, attaining sub-second inference latency. Further, unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-Means) and temporal (LSTM) models are incorporated for stealthy anomaly localization and early threat prediction. This work presents a scalable, interpretable, and cryptographically secure solution for protecting next-generation smart grids against evolving data integrity threats.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has gained significant attention in past few years. The rarity of anomalies, considerable data volatility, absence of anomaly labels, and need for real-time inference in modern applications makes it a challenging problem. A robust training mechanism is desired that can accurately detect anomalous points in dataset with significantly large sized normal data. Moreover, multivariate data recorded by multiple sensors significantly varies from normal values in case of any defect. It is crucial to detect which specific sensor’s data are abnormal for system analysis and correction. To address these issues, we present a self-supervised transformer for anomaly detection, STAD, which enables robust learning from unlabeled data by synthesizing pseudo-anomalies during training. The research contributions are manifold. Firstly, a synthetic anomaly injection method is developed for anomaly generation and self-supervised training on critical anomalous behaviors. Secondly, a multi-head context attention module is designed and embedded with Transformer architecture to map the local and global associations, effectively distinguishing rare anomalies. Lastly, we propose attentive class activation tokens mapping mechanism that facilitates anomaly attribution by tracing the influence of individual sensor inputs through the Transformer model, offering transparent and interpretable insights. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving superior F1 scores and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.},

However, current techniques, such as multisensor data fusion (e.g. electroencephalogram, heart rate, eye movements, and other physiological signals), suffer from excessive dimensionality, intersubject variability, imbalanced feature vectors, and poor data alignment between sensors. This paper contributes three crucial points to addressing these difficulties and improving the performance in the classification of cognitive workload. First, it presents a novel theoretical model that explains the performance benefits of multimodal sensor fusion. Second, it introduces a feature augmentation strategy based on novel initial centroids optimizer techniques using k-means clustering that are intended to improve feature robustness in high-dimensional multisensor data. Third, it creates a hybrid learning pipeline that combines supervised and unsupervised methods, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble stacking, to improve cross-task generalisability and classification accuracy. When evaluated across eight multimodal sensor datasets (one public and seven self-made), at first, feature importance analysis corroborated the contribution of the augmented features. Secondly, the applied technique consistently improves the binary and multiclass workload classifications. Statistical tests proved the significance of performance gains. Thus, the results show that the proposed methods are useful in improving the measurement of cognitive workload from multisensor data.},

  abstract     = {In smart grid (SG), smart meter (SM) is the key component, which collects real-time grid load data to support intelligent applications, such as load prediction, failure detection, and dynamic billing. Despite benefits, the SM readings of grid loads also potentially leak personal information, resulting in smart meter privacy problem. Rechargeable battery (RB) deployed at the user side can be utilized to shape grid loads, thereby enhancing privacy preservation and cost efficiency. The energy management design is formulated as a sequential decision optimization problem to tradeoff the privacy risk, which is measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between grid loads and target loads, and the energy cost, which depends on a time-of-use electricity energy price. A novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) is proposed to efficiently design the privacy-preserving and cost-efficient energy management policy. The effectiveness of the ADRL-aided energy management policy design is verified through experiments and the superiority of the proposed approach is shown by comparing with state-of-the-art privacy-preserving load shaping method.},

  abstract     = {Real-time simulation of large deformations in soft bodies has long faced a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. This paper presents a novel Local Linear Corotated Finite Element Method that addresses this challenge through a hybrid strategy combining direct and iterative solvers. Our method decomposes the simulation domain into element groups; the dynamics within each group are resolved using a pre-computed direct method, while inter-group interactions are handled by efficient iterative constraints. This domain decomposition enables significant pre-computation, replacing runtime equation solving with fast matrix-vector multiplications. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy, demonstrating higher fidelity than similarly fast methods. The method supports anisotropic materials and achieves low volume change (2.95% error) under nearly incompressible conditions. Furthermore, its group-based architecture exhibits high scalability on multi-core processors, reducing computation time to 19.6 ms for a 120,000-tetrahedron model using 64 threads. These characteristics make our method well-suited for demanding applications such as surgical simulation, haptic feedback systems, and real-time digital twins, where both accuracy and performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {The fastest growing and deadliest cancer, skin cancer, requires diagnostic solutions that are accurate, understandable, and therapeutically actionable. Our six-stage deep ensemble diagnostic framework, XAI-SkinCADx, employs hybrid feature extraction, deep learning ensembles, understandable AI, and clinical recommendation creation to meet this need. The 2367 dermoscopy images belonging to nine distinct classes of the ISIC skin cancer dataset are used to train the framework. Adding 5,023 new images makes the dataset richer and better balanced across the classes. A comprehensive performance evaluation is ensured by using the dataset with an 80:20 train-data/test-data split. It begins with hand-designed feature extraction using GLCM-based dimensionality reduction and visualization and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) visualization. Three convolutional neural networks are then employed to extract specific spatial features: DV-25 (DenseNet201 + VGG16), DE-25 (DenseNet201 + EfficientNetB5), and DM-25 (DenseNet201 + MobileNetV2). Temporal patterns are described with bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and finally classified with multiclass SVM. The accuracy is 95.63%, precision is 96.2%, recall is 95.7%, F1 score is 95.9%, and area under curve is 0.97. We interpret it using Grad-CAM++ and LIME. Compared to Grad-CAM++, LIME had better localization accuracy (IoU: 0.78, Dice: 0.87) while Grad-CAM++ had worse accuracy (IoU: 0.70, Dice: 0.81). The best performing classes with LIME interpretability, Vascular Lesion, Seborrhoeic Keratosis, and Dermatofibroma, respectively, with Dice scores of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 respectively. For providing patients with personalized suggestions independent of other information, a dermatology-focused LIME-based recommendation platform was designed. The timely dermatology consultation and decreased clinical burden are led by the classification by the system of the disorders as low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk. By integrating accuracy, clarity, and utility, XAI-SkinCADx creates a new benchmark for applying AI in the diagnosis of skin disease, enabling physicians to make well-informed and trusted decisions.},

The work is specifically applied to low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LTPEMFC) systems that employ short-circuit (SC) activation techniques to enhance catalytic activity during operation. The design addresses the energy supply discontinuity problem to the load during SC time intervals, allowing energy normally dissipated through an electronic switch to be supplied to the balance of plant (BOP), thereby minimizing energy losses and increasing system efficiency. A model-based design approach using numerical simulation tools was applied to validate the feasibility of the proposed system for a 1 kW fuel cell. Results show greater energy recovery at lower operating power (50 W), reaching 4.27% and 2.38% for theoretical and simulation validation, with the following supplier parameters: 9.00 V SC voltage, 100 ms SC pulse duration, and 10 s SC interval. Previous sensitivity studies reveal that the optimal parameter combination integrates 100 ms SC pulse duration, 0.5 s SC interval, that combined with 9.00 V SC voltage, yields 34% energy recovery at 50 W. ESR aging in energy storage supercapacitors affects SC effectiveness more than capacity degradation over 5000 h of LTPEMFC stack operation. The proposed method enables LTPEMFC operation expansion to lower power conditions, compensating for damage in idle and start-stop cycling modes.

However, the controllers employing four independent torque and brake, and active front steering actuators still need more investigation. In this paper, an integrated control structure is proposed to navigate the autonomous vehicle in trajectory tracking task at high speeds. A kinematic-based approach is introduced to estimate the longitudinal forces of each wheel. The steering angle is designed based on a robust sliding mode control, which is responsible for the convergence of the lateral errors to zero. The proof of stability for both longitudinal and lateral controllers in the integrated framework are provide based on the Lyapunov’s stability theorem. Finally, a co-simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim software to appraise the performance of the control system. The results show that the control method is able to perform the trajectory tracking in high-speed lane change. Additionally, the proposed control system performs better in terms of maximum amplitude of errors and root mean square of errors when compared to the results of other research. Furthermore, the proposed robust control framework shows promising results in the presence of external disturbance and parametric uncertainties.},

When it comes to evaluation, the accuracy of recommendations and ranked lists offers a narrow view of the performance, usability, customer satisfaction, and risks of an RS. Among several other desirable properties of an RS, fairness has rightfully gained a prominent place in the research community. Trade-offs have been documented between conflicting metrics, but no work has addressed these as a dynamic time-varying properties. By proposing a novel experimental framework that models accuracy and fairness as evolving, non-static properties of RS, we aim to provide a new way of examining RS properties and present fresh evidence on trade-offs. The significance of this topic lies in its implications for real-world deployment, where fairness across users and items, especially in multi-stakeholder contexts, changes over time and must be balanced with predictive accuracy. By re-framing fairness using stereotype-based control groups, we enable more nuanced and dynamic assessments. We apply this framework across multiple real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens+IMDb, Amazon), simulating user and item cold-start scenarios in a walk-forward evaluation setup. The results highlight the complex trade-offs between competing metrics and offer actionable insights for the design of fairer, more robust recommender systems.},

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, the ranges of head pose and gaze are believed to play significant roles in the final performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows that the model using only our synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data extended with a large label range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance on multiple target domains. The data are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/Gaze-NV-Rendering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, knowledge distillation-based approaches have demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. These methods typically compute pointwise feature discrepancies between teacher and student (T–S) to localize anomalies. However, this paradigm suffers from two issues that degrade performance: (1) some normal regions exhibit large feature differences between T-S networks (leading to false detections), while (2) certain anomalous regions produce small differences (causing missed detections). To address this, we propose a Dual-Teacher Guided Denoising (DTGD) distillation framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a noise-removal task, where anomalies are treated as noise. Specifically, the DTGD framework includes a normal teacher, an anomaly teacher, and a denoising encoder-decoder student. The normal teacher encodes pristine normal data, and the anomaly teacher captures potential anomaly features from synthetic anomalies, guiding the student network to retain normal features and expel noise. After each encoder block of the student, our teacher-guided noise removal (TNR) module injects knowledge from the anomaly teacher, explicitly teaching the student which features to preserve. Furthermore, consistency loss and dissimilarity loss functions enforce consistency with the normal teacher in both encoder/decoder outputs and increase dissimilarity of anomaly-related features from the anomaly teacher via pixel-wise supervision. Experiments on anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that DTGD achieves advanced localization accuracy and produces sharper anomaly maps, reducing both false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal cancer (EC) remains the disease that has the highest incidence and highest mortality rate in global cancer statistics, emphasising the imperative to enhance diagnostic precision and reliability through the use of advancing technologies. While AI-enhanced systems can improve the early detection of EC considerably, the prevalence of artefacts (1 in 4 frames) during endoscopy procedures compromises the developed systems significantly, leading to unreliable medical decision making. Vision transformer (ViT) networks, initially designed for natural language processing tasks, have demonstrated outstanding performance in handling medical images by presenting distinctive features advantageous for image processing. The application of ViT for detecting and classifying artefacts in endoscopic images, particularly in classifying colour misalignment artefacts is still subject to continual refinement and enhancement. This work aims to investigate the implementation of ViT for classification of colour misalignment artefacts in esophagus endoscopy images. Moreover, even though ViT has been a major breakthrough, its acceptance for real world applications is often jeopardised due to the lack of interpretability of how the classification results have been reached. Consequently, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been explored to understand the criteria used to achieve the outcome. Several variants of the ViT and Data Efficient image Transformer (DeiT) networks have been fine-tuned and applied to our dataset in order to improve and evaluate their performance in colour misalignment classification in esophagus endoscopic images. Furthermore, XAI methods have been implemented to provide the criteria used by the network in reaching the classification results. Our fine-tuned ViT model, achieves an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 93.48%, recall of 93.46% and F1 score of 93.46% surpassing InceptionResNetV2, a state-of-the-art model based on CNN, with an accuracy of 89.10%, precision of 89.10%, recall of 89.10% and F1 score of 88.23%. Additionally, the GradCAM XAI technique has been found to highlight the deterministic features used by the ViT model better than other XAI methods applied in this work. ViT achieves remarkable performance in classification of colour misalignment artefact outperforming CNNs, attributed to ViT’s enhanced ability to capture pixel relationships through self-attention weights. In addition, the intrinsic self-attention technique provides novel insights into the model’s decision-making mechanism.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel approach, Channel Selection Dropout (CSD), designed to regularize deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Unlike standard Dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons in fully connected layers, CSD works on the image channels within the sequence of convolutional layers. Specifically, CSD is composed of three modules, i.e., Channel Process Module, Channel Drop Module, and Scale Module. CSD primarily emphasizes channels to identify significant channels based on activation values. It preserves channels that possess values above a user-defined threshold α. Channels that are less significant are set to a value of zero. CSD does not add any extra expenses during the CNN architecture training phase. It is used only during training and deployed only at a minimal computational cost. In the testing phase, the network retains its original state, resulting in no added expenses for inference. Moreover, CSD integration into current networks does not require re-pretraining on ImageNet. This makes it fit seamlessly with other datasets. Finally, the performance of CSD with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGGNet-16 is experimentally evaluated across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that setting α= 0.60 significantly enhances performance, with most results reaching over 95% accuracy on the benchmark datasets. However, the performance of α may vary, and it can be adjusted based on the specific dataset and architecture used. The comprehensive results clarify that CSD consistently enhances performance over the baselines. This method can be applied in future CNN applications to mitigate overfitting, particularly in image segmentation, Vision Transformers (ViT), and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes manifest through subtle and non-stationary clinical patterns, posing significant challenges for real-time prediction and monitoring. Conventional machine learning models often struggle to maintain performance under evolving data distributions due to concept drift. This study proposes an adaptive deep learning framework designed to handle concept drift through incremental learning in clinical data streams. The investigation centers on evaluating the effectiveness of various buffering strategies namely, adaptive buffering, FIFO buffering, and streaming without buffering combined with drift detection mechanisms for healthcare prediction. A balanced clinical dataset exhibiting evolving patterns was used to benchmark model performance. Deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM, GRU, LSTM, and Bayesian Neural Networks were incrementally trained, and their drift(Abrupt, Gradual and Recurring) responsiveness was assessed using three categories of detectors: (1) statistical test-based, (2) error-rate-based, and (3) uncertainty-based approaches leveraging Monte Carlo Dropout. Results indicated that adaptive buffering strategies consistently outperformed FIFO and no-buffer strategies, yielding higher accuracy, precision, and recall, especially under abrupt and large drift magnitudes. The hybrid drift detection method, combined with Bi-LSTM, demonstrated the best performance in maintaining retention and minimizing forgetting, even as the drift magnitude increased. Additionally, the drift magnitude study highlighted that larger drifts had a significant impact on model performance, with adaptive buffering and uncertainty-based drift detection proving to be more resilient to high drift intensities. This research underscores the importance of combining robust drift detection methods and adaptive buffering strategies to enhance the robustness of models dealing with concept drift in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology have highlighted critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities within In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs), particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. While numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) exist, significant gaps remain in addressing resource efficiency and the challenge of Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data in distributed vehicular environments. This study proposes Fed-CALiBER, a novel framework that synergistically combines a compact, pre-trained Lightweight BERT model with a Federated Learning (FL) architecture. By training collaboratively on distinct datasets assigned to Raspberry Pi edge clients, our approach preserves data privacy by keeping raw data localized and is explicitly designed to enhance generalization across Non-IID data distributions. With a reduced communication overhead by transmitting a small parameter footprint (approx. 13 MB) during federated updates, Fed-CALiBER minimizes network overhead during parameter aggregation. Our two-cycle experimental results demonstrate that the federated global model significantly outperforms standalone models in cross-dataset generalization—improving F1-scores on unseen datasets from as lowas 71.39% to over 96.59%—and successfully adapts to shifting data distributions. The framework is validated as a practical edge solution, achieving real-time inference (3–4 ms per sample) with low computational overhead on Raspberry Pi clients, representing a lightweight edge client.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a hybrid optimisation framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the construction of high-order Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. Such schemes underpin accurate and efficient time integration in computational science and engineering, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics to orbital mechanics and neural ODEs. Traditional optimisation of RK coefficients with interior-point solvers becomes increasingly infeasible as stage counts grow, due to the rapid increase in parameters and the highly nonconvex nature of the feasible region. Our approach addresses this by introducing dynamic algebraic heuristics that contract the search space through symbolic relations among coefficients. GA provides global exploration via mutation, while RL adaptively refines candidate heuristics based on reward signals, guiding optimisation towards stable regions while strictly enforcing order conditions. Empirical studies on third-order Extended-Stability Runge–Kutta (ESRK) schemes show reductions in Interior point optimiser (IPOPT) iteration counts of up to 36.7% for a-coefficients, with additional improvements of 32.5% and 24.5% for b- and c-coefficients. Statistical validation using t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of these improvements. Symbolic verification demonstrates that the discovered heuristics generalise across stage counts, maintaining full rank of the order-condition Jacobians and preserving third-order accuracy. Benchmark tests on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) systems, including the Brusselator, confirm both expected convergence and efficiency gains. These results establish GA–RL-guided optimisation as a scalable, robust methodology for designing advanced RK integrators, with potential to extend stability-optimised schemes to both classical simulations and modern machine learning contexts.},

This problem considers the assignment of CPU and bandwidth resources to servers and links, subject to network resource constraints. Given the dynamic nature of 5G core networks, where bandwidth and CPU processing demands fluctuate due to time-varying demand, user mobility, diverse QoS requirements, potential link failures, server outages, and the coexistence of multiple virtual networks (VNs), a dynamic resource assignment strategy is adopted in this work as opposed to static approaches in previous works. The majorization-minimization approach is used to handle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an approximation-based algorithm for core network resource assignment (ACNRA) with an affordable computational complexity is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing both network resource costs and server energy consumption. Statistical analysis of these results shows that our proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving average reductions of 5.92% and 10.28% in resource cost, and 5.43% and 10.10% in energy consumption.},

Effective risk assessment is therefore critical for improving workplace safety and guiding preventive actions. This study proposes an integrated risk assessment framework that combines the classical and fuzzy Fine-Kinney methods with the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PFAHP). The key contributions are: (i) identification of 26 hazards across four operational areas (office, storage, transportation, and pressure testing), (ii) incorporation of activity-specific weights using PFAHP, and (iii) comparative evaluation of classical vs. fuzzy Fine-Kinney scores. The results demonstrate that fuzzy-based evaluations significantly change hazard rankings (e.g., office fire hazard moved from 8th to 2nd), while PFAHP weighting shifts the relative importance of operational domains. These findings highlight the advantages of combining uncertainty modeling and activity-based weighting to achieve more context-aware risk prioritization. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable framework for occupational health and safety risk evaluation in high-risk industries.},

  abstract     = {Image edges are essential for understanding and processing the content of the acquired scene, but a clear edge detection is not always possible. Unfavorable environmental conditions, poor lighting, incorrect camera settings and/or vibrations may produce blurry or dark images with unclear content and details. Local spatial filters are integrated into many hardware and software as sharpening tools, but choosing the most adequate filter and its parameters is usually non trivial. This work proposes a new filter, whose kernel is computed by comparing over a pre-defined window the image Prewitt gradient with an image contrast measure inspired by Retinex theory. The experiments, carried out on public real-world images with different edge visibility, show that the proposed image-aware filter efficaciously increases the edge visibility with low computational cost and performs better than a standard Laplacian filter. As an usage example, the sharpening filter is here applied to medical images of retinal fundus: improving the clarity and detail of these images is essential for visualizing and analysing anatomical structures, identifying abnormalities, and assisting in diagnosis and treatments. Finally, a hardware architecture of the sharpening filter, partially integrating on-chip the gradient and contrast computation, is outlined. Such an integration could be beneficial for enhancing in real-time the quality of pictures captured by devices with limited power resources, with an average consumption of ∼ 28 μW and ∼ 30 kb of embedded memory in case of a color VGA image. The data obtained in filter validation experiments show a marked increase in the Prewitt’s gradient magnitudes in 100% of cases and in the edge thickness in a percentage ranging from 73.3% to 100% of cases, without visibly affecting the image naturalness.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to unprecedented volumes of unlabeled sensor data due to its constantly evolving nature. This phenomenon has created an acute need for learning models capable of intelligently use such data devoid of expensive manual labeling. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has recently arisen as an efficient paradigm to meet this challenge by directly deriving informative representations from unlabeled data. Nevertheless, the practical application of SSL models is hindered by their over-dependence on hyperparameter tuning, which remains a central challenge. In addressing this challenge, we introduce an MA-ASA (Memory-Augmented Adaptive Simulated Annealing) framework for hyperparameter tuning that has been optimized to this specificity. This framework is built on the concepts of temperature-adaptive mechanisms, short-term memory buffers to mitigate repetitive evaluations, and stagnation-initiated restarts, offering greater efficiency in dealing with hyperparameter space complexities. The proposed method employs a two-step framework consisting of denoising convolutional autoencoder (dCae) SSL pretraining on unlabeled data and logistic regression downstream classification on sparse labeled data. The approach was tested on UCI HAR, MHEALTH, and Environmental Sensor Telemetry datasets achieving classification accuracies of 96.00%, 97.33%, and 99.25%, respectively. The results showcase that the MA-ASA-based optimization strategy improves the performance and generalization of SSL models relative to other IoT domains, all while retaining computational efficiency and scalability.},

Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, the model is evaluated under two experimental scenarios: a conventional random split and a more rigorous zero-day split, where ransomware families in the test set are entirely excluded from training. In binary classification, the proposed system achieves 97.6% accuracy (F1-score: 0.98) in the random split and 95.9% accuracy (F1-score: 0.96) in the zero-day setup, consistently prioritizing high recall for ransomware detection. In multiclass classification, it attains 97.0% and 92.0% accuracy in the random and zero-day splits, respectively.

This study conducted a systematic review of NS-AI architectures published between 2013 and 2024, synthesizing the structural patterns and integration strategies in 319 peer-reviewed publications. From this corpus, 18 representative approaches were selected based on their methodological rigor, symbolic fidelity, and conceptual novelty. These approaches were subsequently classified into three architectural paradigms: Sequential, Multi-Integration, and Hybrid. Based on this classification, a five-stage symbolic integration framework is proposed, comprising (i) data preprocessing, (ii) neural–symbolic embedding, (iii) incorporation of domain knowledge, (iv) logical reasoning modules, and (v) symbolic postprocessing. The findings indicate that multistage symbolic integration, particularly when embedded within neural layers and reasoning components, improves system explainability, robustness, and semantic alignment. Comparative analysis further reveals a fundamental trade-off: architectures grounded in formal logic exhibit higher precision and verifiability, whereas those employing representational-symbolic languages yield greater interpretability and flexibility. The resulting generic architecture provides a modular design blueprint for future NS-AI systems, supporting scalable, transparent, and semantically grounded AI development.},

Key device parameters—capacitance, bandwidth, light-sensitive area, and excess noise—are characterized and compared. All devices were fabricated on the same wafer for direct performance comparison. The presented dot-cathode photodiodes achieve significantly reduced total and normalized (per area) capacitance without compromising bandwidth compared to planar APDs. Among them, electric field line crowding (EFLC) based APDs demonstrate superior performance with the highest responsivity (0.4AW−1 @642 nm), lowest capacitance per area (1.58 aF μm−2), and low excess noise (F = 1.8 @ M = 10) with a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. In contrast, the presented N+/P-well (NPPW) based APDs exhibit high excess noise making them unsuitable for data receiver applications. Notably, the only PIN device presented, uniquely operates in PIN mode with maximum bandwidth, while all other devices show reduced bandwidth unless they are operated in APD mode.},

The development of functions that target the performance improvement of such systems requires understanding of the dynamics of the received signal. However, measurements of the signal received power (SRP) reported to date are limited to the blockage and micromobility phenomena in isolation. In this study, by utilizing individual measurements of blockage and micromobility processes, we propose a procedure for generating synthetic time series of the received signal strength simultaneously capturing blockage, micromobility, and beam-tracking procedures. Our results reveal that out of all the considered applications, only the most dynamic ones, racing game and VR, are characterized by significant differences between on-demand and regular beam tracking with 4-6.5 bits/Hz/s spectral efficiency degradation in the case of on-demand beam tracking as compared to the regular one. For applications with high-speed micromobility (VR watching and race gaming), the minimal beam tracking interval is 80 ms, whereas for low-speed applications, a period of 320 ms and even sometimes 1000 ms is sufficient. Our results show that the availability of information regarding the type of application allows one to decrease the overhead required for beam tracking by up to 20-30 times. The traces produced can be further utilized for various tasks, including the development of statistical tests for discriminating blockage and micromobility events, designing blockage detection algorithms, and improving beam tracking procedures. We made the data produced available to the research community.},

Although B-mode ultrasound is accessible and safe, its reliability is limited by operator and scanner variability. We present the Deep Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DDANN), a deep learning system for multiclass steatosis classification (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe) from ultrasound that emphasizes cross-device generalizability. To mitigate distribution shifts across scanners (LOGIQ, iU22, EPIQ), DDANN combines a MobileNetV2 backbone with triplet loss, entropy-based domain adaptation, and preprocessing that includes speckle suppression, percentile normalization, and LOGIQ-specific harmonization. Trained on a biopsy-confirmed, multi-institutional cohort (primarily LOGIQ and iU22), the model was externally validated on an unseen EPIQ test set of 1,083 images from 47 patients, achieving 98.71% accuracy, 0.9872 macro F1-score, and 0.9998 AUC-ROC, outperforming baselines. In a separate radiologist–AI comparison on 224 biopsy-confirmed images not used for training or validation, the AI reached 91.96% accuracy, significantly exceeding radiologists’ 19.64%–31.70% (McNemar’s test, p < 0.001), with strong agreement to ground truth (κ = 0.893) versus radiologists’ poor-to-slight agreement (κ = 0.006–0.194). The AI maintained balanced class-wise F1-scores (0.90–0.94), while radiologists struggled, particularly with Mild and Moderate cases, and exhibited substantial inter-reader variability (κ = 0.068–0.648).

  abstract     = {The product delivery process is a set of steps to transport a product of an origin to a delivery point. Nowadays, there are different platforms or software based on classical algorithms for network optimization that help develop routes. Although these informatics systems provide vehicle routes, their prediction time has low accuracy compared to real times in the product distribution, since these systems do not consider the elements that affect route planning, i.e., despite providing vehicle routes, these software systems have low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to use artificial intelligence systems that consider the knowledge of the product delivery planning into route optimization models, thus increasing the time accuracy, but adding the challenge of having to interpret correctly the vehicle route ambiguities. Motivated by the latter, we propose a new fuzzy linear programming formulation to predict delivery times for products. Unlike previous studies, our methodology considers various parameters in the distribution process and offers an effective way to identify which parameters should be used. Our strategy combines the abstraction power of fuzzy logic and the result that provides a route optimization analysis, i.e., this work brings the best of the two worlds to address the difficult problem of shortest-route in product delivery. For that, our methodology has three steps. First, we introduce our formulation that incorporates a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) into linear programming to achieve accurate time predictions in product delivery. Second, we propose a fuzzy adjustment coefficient to consider the uncertain factors in product distribution and the expertise of the delivery staff. Finally, we develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize the distribution route and its time. On the other hand, we evaluate this methodology in the routes of a soft drink company using statistical analyses. Experimental results are feasible and promising. For example, in real-world scenarios, our approach reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 56% compared to methods that utilize artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the novel technology of waveform measurement units (WMUs), it is now possible to record time-synchronized waveforms (synchro-waveforms) at different power system locations. Leveraging these new opportunities, this paper introduces a method for accurate wideband measurement-based reconstruction of single- and three-phase frequency-dependent transmission line models for electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies. This method also accommodates hybrid (overhead-underground) systems and longitudinal parameter variations (nonuniformities). A 2-port line model is generated across a broad frequency spectrum using WMU terminal recordings and the numerical Laplace transform. For single-phase uniform lines, one transient recording set is sufficient for model reconstruction; this extends to ideally transposed three-phase lines. For single-phase nonuniform and three-phase uniform and nonuniform untransposed lines, a minimum norm least-squares method is applied to solve an overdetermined system from multiple recordings with linearly independent responses. Simulated measurements from ATP (Alternative Transient Program) are used for three test cases: a three-phase balanced uniform line, a single-phase hybrid system, and a three-phase unbalanced nonuniform line. The reconstructed model responses are compared with ATP simulations, confirming the technique’s accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the impact of practical signal conditions on reconstruction accuracy is analyzed in detail, including noise, resolution, and ratio and phase displacement errors from instrument transformers.},

  abstract     = {Embedding-based graph representation learning methods have shown strong performance on knowledge graphs (KGs), but most are designed for static settings and struggle to model temporal dynamics. To address this gap, we present TimeGate, a novel time-sensitive graph attention network tailored for temporal KG (TKG) representation learning. Unlike traditional approaches that discretize graphs into time-based snapshots, TimeGate directly models timestamps as edge-level attributes and jointly encodes entities, relations, temporal signals, and neighbors into unified initial representations. A temporal-relational self-attention mechanism further refines these embeddings by adaptively weighting neighbors based on contextual relevance. A key innovation of TimeGate lies in its multi-model and multi-task generality: it supports both temporal KG completion and time-aware entity alignment (EA) within a unified, end-to-end architecture, and can flexibly serve as a plug-in encoder to boost diverse existing TKG models—without relying on recurrent networks or snapshot partitioning. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (ICEWS, GDELT,Wikidata, and YAGO) demonstrate that TimeGate not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-aware EA tasks, but also consistently enhances the predictive accuracy of multiple backbone TKG completion models, highlighting TimeGate’s practical scalability, and broad applicability.},

  abstract     = {Private 5G (P5G) networks are driving large-scale industrial and enterprise internet of things (IoT) deployments. However, uncoordinated P5G deployments can lead to unintended signal leakage and inter-network interference between neighboring P5G systems. Constructing a radio environment map (REM) is a practical way to visualize and manage such interference. It typically relies on spatially regular measurements, but drive-test-based data are often sparse and spatially irregular. Furthermore, since signal strength inherently includes path loss, the spatial distribution becomes non-stationary and unsuitable for direct interpolation under sparse and spatially irregular sampling conditions. Removing the path loss component requires knowledge of the interference source location, but the source location is generally unknown in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement-based method to detect, localize, and map interference leakage. A novel localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the leakage source using only sparse and irregular measurements. The estimated source location enables decomposition of path loss and shadow fading, supporting accurate REM construction through spatial interpolation. Field measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling interference diagnosis and providing spatial evidence aligned with regulatory requirements for safe coexistence between neighboring P5G networks.},

By relying on COTS components, the need for fabricating custom and expensive semiconductor dies and limited-access transistor models for Class-F operations is eliminated. A hybrid design methodology, combining NLE-based optimal harmonic terminations with optimum load-pull-based fundamental source and load matching, is proposed to overcome their individual limitations. The proposed approach achieves optimum RF power and 3% higher Power- Added Efficiency (PAE) in S-band (81% vs 78%), 4.5% higher PAE in C-band (78% vs 72.5%) & more than 5% higher PAE in Ku-band (64% vs 57%), compared to prior COTS and MMIC-based works. A continuous-wave (CW) Class-F PA at 2 GHz is developed first as a baseline, and the design methodology is then extended to 5.5 GHz and 11.2 GHz (where transistor parasitics necessitate an inverse-Class-F topology). Dielectric constant variations beyond 10 GHz are analyzed, and a novel Class-F-1 harmonic control network (HCN) is introduced to achieve a first-pass design at 11.2 GHz. The fabricated prototypes include a 10 W Class-F HPA at 2 GHz, a 10 W inverse-Class-F HPA at 5.5 GHz and a miniaturized 25 W Class-F-1 HPA at 11.2 GHz. Performance measurements of these HPAs confirm superior efficiency, optimum RF output power and efficient thermal management (using low-cost copper-coin ring). The proposed CW GaN-based amplifiers (with linearizers) offer a compact, efficient and reliable alternative to bulky and power-hungry traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), making them highly suitable for satellite transponders and ground-based systems.},

The algorithm first applies spectral clustering to the PS from historical moments to automatically identify multiple subclasses of the PS. When environmental changes occur, the algorithm uses historical information to predict the centroids and shapes of each subclass, thereby constructing a new initial population. Experimental results on 14 standard dynamic test problems indicate that the proposed SCP-DMOEA outperforms four typical algorithms—PPS, MDP, KTM, and RNN—in handling various change characteristics in most test functions. These characteristics include translation or rotation changes of the PS, correlations between decision variables, and time-varying mixed Pareto optimal fronts (PFs), including variations in convexity and concavity. In particular, SCP-DMOEA also shows superior performance when handling optimization problems with more complex PF changes, such as the position of the PF continuously changes over time, the objective vector oscillates among several modes, and the PFs are discontinuous.},

To determine optimal segment boundaries, the system incorporates an Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM) that automatically analyzes sensor characteristics and selects boundary configurations that minimize global calibration error. At the algorithmic level, the proposed method integrates a Simplified Progressive Polynomial Calibration (SPPC) technique, which addresses the exponential growth in polynomial order observed in conventional Progressive Polynomial Calibration (PPC) methods as the number of calibration points increases. SPPC mitigates this complexity through a linear-order growth strategy while preserving high calibration accuracy within each segment. The system is implemented on a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with a dedicated Sensor Calibration Module (SCM) optimized for 8-bit signed fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed approach was validated through MATLAB simulations and RTL-level hardware implementation. Experimental results demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in execution time compared to conventional PPC and a 2.35% improvement in calibration accuracy through segmented calibration. Notably, the ASM-based segmentation achieved up to a 5.87% reduction in calibration error compared to non-segmented methods, even under varying input conditions, effectively reducing the need for manual tuning. These results confirm that the proposed architecture provides a high-performance, hardware-efficient, and adaptive solution for real-time calibration of sensors affected by nonlinearities and cross-sensitivity, making it well-suited for a wide range of embedded sensing applications.},

However, large-scale integration of these variable energy sources poses several challenges to network operators. Traditional planning models also do not lead to economic expansion plans at high integration of renewable energy due to renewable energy curtailments. Researchers have incorporated several techniques, such as dynamic line rating and demand side management, into network expansion planning for effective utilization of RES, but these techniques are not effective at high penetration of renewable energy. There is growing interest in energy storage system (ESS) due to its ability to deal with intermittency issues of RES by storing excess energy when available and delivering back during peak hours. This paper introduces a coordinated generation, transmission, and storage expansion planning model, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem. The model is used to study the economic impact of co-optimizing investments in these three asset classes subject to RPS targets up to 75%. We also analyze ESS impact on CO2 emissions from thermal sources and overall network performance. The model is implemented on a modified IEEE 24-bus system and numerical results show that up to 16.2% savings could be achieved in total cost at 75% RPS by utilizing the existing network more optimally compared to the case when no ESS investments are considered. Moreover, the renewable curtailments are significantly reduced at high RPS by integrating ESS and network utilization is also increased.},

First, prior to encoding, the input image is enhanced using SAM to incorporate boundary prior maps generated by SAM, thereby mitigating boundary ambiguity. Subsequently, a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder is integrated into the encoding network to facilitate information propagation. This module captures high-resolution spatial details while effectively leveraging global contextual relationships. During the decoding phase, multi-scale feature fusion is performed to ensure comprehensive utilization of features across varying scales, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy. Experiments on the LoveDA and Potsdam datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values of 53.52% (LoveDA), 79.45% (Potsdam) and 75.12%(Vaihingen), significantly outperforming existing methods.

  abstract     = {Sustainability in supply chains, particularly through effective trade-in programs, has become increasingly critical in addressing modern environmental and management challenges posed by short-life-cycle electronic products. Trade-in programs play a pivotal role in enabling sustainable closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) by promoting product returns and recycling, yet they encounter significant complexities. To address these challenges, this study introduces and empirically validates a novel hybrid decision-making framework combining Cloud Model Theory (CMT), DEMATEL, and MARCOS methods. Initially, expert linguistic assessments are systematically transformed into quantitative cloud parameters, capturing inherent uncertainties and intricate factor interdependencies. The CMT-DEMATEL analysis highlights economic and incentive-driven factors, notably pricing strategies and subsidies, as critical causal influence factors. Subsequently, MARCOS analysis identifies quality considerations, return rates, and real-time inventory systems as top priorities due to their comprehensive impact on sustainability, resilience, and digitalization. The sensitivity analysis then shows that the resilience weight is the most visible leverage: the importance of the inventory system rises or falls in direct proportion to its emphasis. The alignment between these analytical findings and practical industry scenarios underscores the framework's relevance and utility. This integrated approach provides managers with a robust, actionable guide for optimizing trade-in program performance, effectively bridging key methodological gaps in existing trade-in and CLSC literature.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) plays a prominent role in controlling modern power converters and electric drives. However, selecting weighting factors (WFs) remains challenging, particularly when considering additional control objectives (ACOs). To address this challenge, this paper proposes a straightforward, cost-effective, and flexible decision-making (DM) method for multi-objective FCS-MPC strategies. The proposed hierarchical structure DM method utilises the Euclidean norm to individually evaluate the main and additional control performances. Because it allows for the expansion of the number of hierarchical stages and does not require a sorting algorithm, it stands out as a flexible and technically effective solution among existing DM techniques for the given problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it is applied to the model predictive torque control (MPTC) strategy to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The MPTC with the proposed DM method is tested under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional MPTC. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed DM technique to handle ACOs in conjunction with the main control objectives and system constraints, while also demonstrating increased flexibility, enhanced control performance, and reduced computational demand.},

Automated detection and segmentation of these road defects are essential for efficient maintenance planning and hazard mitigation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of transformer based segmentation models applied for the detection and segmentation of potholes and cracks on different road surfaces. We introduce a custom dataset specifically modeled for urban roads that can be used for low-middle income countries with poor infrastructure and low maintenance resources. It features diverse road images under varying lighting, weather, and road conditions. We compare the performance of various segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness on this dataset. Our experimental results reveal significant performance variations across model architectures: larger models (M12) achieved the highest precision of 0.621 for bounding boxes and 0.618 for masks, while smaller models (M1) demonstrated computational efficiency with precision scores of 0.491 and 0.428 respectively. The mAP@50 scores ranged from 0.225 to 0.314 across all models, with Family III variants showing mixed performance profiles. Computational benchmarking revealed inference speeds ranging from 25-35 FPS for large models to 85-120 FPS for lightweight variants on NVIDIA RTX A6000 hardware. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of different models, providing insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of road maintenance and safety.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, novel designs of circular planar antennas capable of generating conical beam (CB) radiation patterns for millimeter-wave (mmWave) drone and vehicle communications are presented. The proposed geometry of the antenna comprises a circular patch surrounded by 18 quarter-wavelength bent stubs/corrugations and underneath coaxial feed that support the TM01 mode and produce a narrow-band linearly polarized (LP) CB radiation pattern. To increase the antenna bandwidth by improving impedance matching, six radial line slots were strategically placed in the top-patch, each oriented at 60° with respect to each other and rotated by 30° along the axis alignment. This configuration significantly improved the antenna’s bandwidth and maintains the beam at constant angle. Through optimization of the physical dimensions of the design, LP-CB antenna achieved a peak gain of 9.2 dBi with less than 1.5 dB variation across the bandwidth between 24.2 to 30 GHz. Moreover, gain patterns are circularly symmetric with very low-ripple at different elevation angles. By using the same top layer, and introducing three rings of tilted slots (6, 12 and 12 slots in each ring) in the ground plane, a second antenna is designed which is circularly polarized (CP) with a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 27.5 to 30.8 GHz. Across the operating band, the beam points at the elevation angle of 24° ± 1° for both the antennas. The simulated and measured results demonstrate that both the proposed antennas can achieve a -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW) of more than 22.2% for the LP design, 10.5% in the CP design, and both exhibit stable and consistent radiation patterns with efficiency values of better than 80%. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements was achieved. A simple planar geometry with wide bandwidth, high gain, and good CB radiation performance makes the designs promising candidates for 5G mmWave communications.},

  abstract     = {Although deepfake detection methodologies have advanced considerably, they remain susceptible to evasion techniques, a critical vulnerability in forensic systems. Most detection approaches that rely on generator-specific artifacts or high-frequency fingerprints become susceptible to circumvention when these discriminative features are eliminated. As a means to expose such blind spots in state-of-the-art forensics, we introduce GenPure, a novel multi-stage purification framework that systematically removes both low- and high-level synthetic cues, enabling generated images to bypass diverse detectors under a strict black-box setting. In the GenPure detection evasion pipeline, a U-Net-based reconstruction module with multi-scale, spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels first attenuates synthetic artifacts while preserving perceptual fidelity. Next, a vision foundation model—intentionally unbiased toward authentic-synthetic classification—aligns the attenuated images with authentic image characteristics by minimizing distribution discrepancies in latent space. Finally, reference-guided statistical color recalibration restores natural tone and further masks residual forensic cues. The framework requires no detector knowledge or additional training and generalizes across generator types, resolutions, and content domains. Extensive experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art evasion performance across multiple unseen generative sources and detection systems without degrading visual quality. The results exposed persistent structural weaknesses in current forensic pipelines and underscore the need for semantically grounded, manipulation-invariant defenses.},

This paper proposes a method for measuring and evaluating the line loss of power quality in the transformer area. This method decouples line losses based on IEEE 1459 and uses graph theory to solve the power quality line losses power factor of branch. By establishing the solution function of the power factor of line loss in the transformer area, clarifying the constraint conditions, the power quality line loss is solved by using the line loss of supply volume, the power factor of line loss of each branch, and the fuzzy range of line parameters. The simulation of the actual transformer area model shows that this method can calculate the line loss when the line impedance and length are not clear.},

Our imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) system consists of three modules: face and landmark detection, time-series extraction, and pulse signal/pulse rate estimation. The pulse signal estimation module, which we call TURNIP (Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography), allows the system to faithfully reconstruct the underlying pulse signal waveform and uses it to measure pulse rate and pulse rate variability metrics, even in the presence of motion. When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such “self-occluded” regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information. Our algorithm provides reliable pulse rate estimates without the need for specialized sensors or contact with the skin, outperforming previous iPPG methods on both color (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) datasets.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety and depression are prevalent psychological disorders that can occur throughout life, with a notably higher prevalence among women during the perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the postpartum phase. The early detection and monitoring of these conditions are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Although healthcare analytics has progressed considerably, the extraction of actionable insights from large-scale patient data remains computationally intensive, especially under instant processing constraints. Furthermore, conventional healthcare infrastructures frequently lack the scalability, computational efficiency, and architectural flexibility required to integrate machine learning models into clinical workflows effectively. To address these challenges, the proposed distributed computing framework employs Apache Kafka for instant data streaming, Apache Spark for efficient in-memory machine learning–based analytics, and Kubernetes for orchestrating scalable, fault-tolerant deployment. This architectural configuration facilitates continuous data ingestion, accelerates analytical processing, and ensures system resilience, thereby enabling the timely identification of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression during the perinatal period. Unlike schematic or batch-only prior work, we provide a production-ready, streaming-first clinical deployment and an empirical scaling analysis linking executors to end-to-end diagnostic latency and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in healthcare analytics.},

This paper introduces the Adverse Weather Affected Image (AWAI) dataset, consisting of 2,800 real-world weather-degraded images and their enhanced counterparts, annotated with subjective perceptual quality scores. We also propose a novel no-reference weather-aware image quality assessment (NRWIQA) algorithm designed for such images to enable quantitative evaluation of enhancement quality. Unlike existing methods that use generic features trained on natural images, our approach extracts deep features sensitive to weather-induced artifacts. A multiscale feature extraction strategy, fused via a cross-attention mechanism, is used to capture degradations across different scales. These features are further refined using a transformer to predict perceptual quality scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NRWIQA algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 17.61% improvement in SROCC, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing the quality of images affected by adverse weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques presents transformative opportunities for accurate energy forecasting and developing decarbonization strategies. However, existing forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex spatial-temporal interdependencies that drive CO₂ emissions such as geographic autocorrelation, delayed policy impacts, and regional socio-economic asymmetries. These limitations hinder predictive performance, particularly in emission-volatile and underrepresented regions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a GIS-Based Intelligent Energy Forecasting System built upon a novel Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Stacking Ensemble (STDSE-Net) framework. The system fuses heterogeneous base models—Random Forest, SVR-RBF, LightGBM and a custom GIS-augmented XGBoost-Geo—through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that dynamically adjusts model weights based on spatial error gradients. A meta-learner (XGBoost) integrates spatially weighted predictions using a hybrid mean-median voting strategy, improving robustness against outliers and data sparsity. Additionally, quantile regression is employed to estimate uncertainty bounds, and a temporal embedding module captures lagged emission trends via rolling policy-aware averages. Trained on the Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000–2020), STDSE-Net achieves a predictive accuracy of R² = 0.98, RMSE = 3.20 Mt, and MAE = 2.10 Mt, outperforming existing benchmarks by 22–48% in accuracy. Its GIS-informed dynamic weighting framework prioritises regionally optimal models, thereby reducing residual bias in heterogeneous contexts, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Spatial-temporal cross-validation confirms strong generalizability, and residual analysis demonstrates uniform error distribution across diverse geographic clusters. By bridging spatial heterogeneity with AI-driven adaptability, STDSE-Net offers a scalable and interpretable blueprint for next-generation emission forecasting. These advancements have direct implications for renewable energy planning, regional grid optimization, and geographically targeted climate policies. Future research will extend this framework by incorporating real-time satellite imagery, transformer-based temporal encoders, and policy document mining to support more granular, long-horizon predictions in dynamic policy environments.},

However, optimization-based approaches lack the flexibility to render multiple subjects with a single model, while acquiring multi-view data necessitates a calibrated multi-view setup. To overcome these limitations, monocular image-based methods have been introduced to enable the rendering of novel views and poses of human subjects in a feed-forward manner from a single image. Nonetheless, monocular images inherently provide limited information, presenting challenges when rendering occluded or invisible regions of the subject. To address this limitation, we propose InVisible-region Augmented Human rendering (IVAH), a method that generates and leverages additional appearance data to represent the unseen regions of the input observation image. Specifically, IVAH synthesizes a back image and a UV map of the human subject, extracting features that facilitate the rendering of the occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of generated appearance data significantly enhances the rendering of invisible regions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that IVAH surpasses current monocular image-based techniques in rendering performance.},

  abstract     = {Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), directly captured from cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, play a crucial role in guiding clinicians’ counseling on treatment-related toxicities. Accurate prediction and assessment of symptoms and health status linked to PROs are essential for improving clinical decision-making and planning post-treatment support as patients transition into survivorship. However, raw PRO data collected in clinical settings presents two inherent challenges, including data sparsity (due to incomplete item responses) and imbalanced toxicity distributions. These factors complicate predictive modeling. This study investigates machine learning techniques to address these challenges by predicting outcomes such as pain and sleep disturbances using PRO datasets from a cancer therapy center. We implement advanced classifiers (i.e., RF, XGBoost, GB, SVM, MLP-Bagging, and LR) for multi-class imbalance tasks across three cancers. To address minority underrepresentation, we apply oversampling while preserving class ratios. Experimental results demonstrate RF and XGBoost’s strong generalization, highlighting their utility in categorizing post-therapy severity levels for clinical decision support.},

HP-BERT achieves 94.72% accuracy, outperforming baseline applications of five transformer models to our specific task. The model incorporates multi-label sentiment analysis capabilities through additional fine-tuning on the "SenWave Dataset". Our analysis encompasses approximately 27.4 million tweets from six countries: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Statistical analysis reveals moderate correlations (r = 0.312-0.428) between COVID-19 case increases and Hinduphobic content volume, highlighting how pandemic-related stress may contribute to discriminatory discourse.

It can significantly affect the key properties of insulating materials used in such equipment. One of the most important insulating materials in high-voltage equipment is mineral transformer oils, which are essential for electrical insulation and thermal management. This study presents a comprehensive experimental investigation into the effects of gamma radiation on the electrical and molecular characteristics of transformer mineral oil. A series of controlled irradiation experiments were conducted using cobalt-60 as the gamma source, applying doses of gamma radiation ranging from 50 to 250 kGy. Various key parameters were used for evaluation, including breakdown voltage, moisture content, acidity, and density. In addition, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to assess structural changes in the oil’s molecular composition due to radiation exposure. All measurements were performed both before and after exposure to the controlled gamma doses to assess the extent of degradation. The FTIR spectra were analyzed in a semi-quantitative manner using the intensity ratio of the aliphatic C–H (~2920 cm-1) to carbonyl (~1730 cm-1) bands to reflect oxidative progression. The observed shifts in the electrical and chemical behavior of mineral oils were correlated with the extent of gamma dose exposure. The underlying mechanisms of gamma-induced degradation in transformer oil were discussed in detail to enhance understanding the key chemical and physical processes responsible for such degradation. To support correlation analysis, polynomial regression was applied to model the nonlinear relationship between gamma dose and breakdown voltage, which represents a key indicator of electrical performance.},

  abstract     = {Predictive maintenance is essential in modern manufacturing for improving the reliability and efficiency of machinery. A central challenge lies in accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as ball bearings, especially when real-world labeled data is scarce. This study addresses this challenge by combining physics-informed simulation with a regression-based transfer learning approach. A 5-degree-of-freedom simulation model was developed to replicate the lifecycle of ball bearings under varying operating conditions, generating synthetic run-to-failure vibration data. The synthetic signals were segmented and processed using statistical and time-frequency features, with dimensionality reduction performed via statistical relevance and multicollinearity filtering. Tree-based regression models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained on the synthetic data and optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. To bridge the domain gap, the Black Box Adversarial Reprogramming (BAR) algorithm was applied to adapt these models for real-world data without retraining. Performance was evaluated across twelve structured transfer tasks using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Results showed that BAR-enhanced models consistently outperformed their unadapted counterparts, with the Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving an RMSE of 10.25 and R2 of 0.87 on the best transfer task. A statistical evaluation over 100 iterations confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, while highlighting its stochastic nature. Overall, the integration of physics-based data generation with BAR-based transfer learning offers a scalable and model-independent solution for accurate RUL prediction under data-constrained conditions.},

Accurate estimation of POA is essential for designing efficient solar systems and predicting energy output. POA can be calculated using transposition models, that consider factors such as solar radiation components (direct and diffuse) and geometrical parameters like the tilt and azimuth angles. This study evaluates the performance of several widely used transposition models in the hot desert (BWh) climate of Doha, Qatar, using high-resolution (1-minute) irradiance data. A dataset spanning more than a year was analyzed with consideration of factors such as albedo, solar zenith angle, cloud cover, precipitation, and air quality. Several performance indicators including relative RMSE, relative MBE, and a risk index, were utilized. Among the tested models, Perez and Perez-Driesse provided the closest agreement with POA irradiance at two south-facing tilt angles, showing stable performance across seasons, while Hay-Davies emerged as least risky model. The analysis also revealed greater sensitivity to albedo at higher tilt angle. Model accuracy declined during cloudy and rainy periods, but improved during clear, dust-prone months. These findings highlight Qatar’s favorable atmospheric conditions for accurate POA modeling, supporting applications such as PV tilt optimization and system sizing, while underscoring the need for refined model tuning to address performance limitations under cloudy conditions.},

DFAG adds auxiliary losses to the feature maps at each multi-scale level during training, which stabilizes deep feature learning and improves feature quality. All modules used for DFAG are only active during training and are removed for inference, resulting in no additional computational cost.We validate DFAG on various multi-scale encoder-decoder-based image restoration models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple tasks, including real image denoising, Gaussian denoising, motion deblurring, JPEG artifact reduction, and super-resolution. Our results highlight that DFAG is an effective strategy to boost restoration performance without any architectural modifications. The source code and pre-trained models will be released.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are primarily capable of withstanding prolonged periods in unstructured marine environments. These are subject to several uncertainties, including the effects of underwater currents or drift, topography, water pressure, and other factors. The inherent motion of the vehicle is influenced by buoyancy or mass error and other slowly varying hydrodynamic coefficients. Moreover, an AUV faces various types of undetected faults during its mission execution. The use of large-dimensional, rigorous onboard sensor data from real-time AUV operations, subject to the limited power capacity and the presence of other acoustic issues, makes it more challenging for the control community from both stability and positioning accuracy perspectives. Hence, an anti-disturbance stabilized control mechanism is intended to perform a variety of underwater tasks in various uncertain oceanic environments. A two-stage high-degree cubature information filter (TSHDCIF) is designed to effectively observe unmatched external disturbances, uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, and actuator faultiness. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme incorporated with the TSHDCIF observer is proposed in this work. Various realistic scenario-based result sets, including 1) effects on ocean currents, 2) variations in hydrodynamic parameters, and 3) loss of actuator effectiveness, are addressed in this study. The control solution is compared with the baseline NMPC scheme to examine its efficacy, including depth accuracy, control aggression, convergence analysis, and computation time per iteration. Based on the analysis, the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme outperforms the traditional NMPC scheme by 5.49% in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) and 1.73% in terms of mean square deviation (MSD). The stability of the closed-loop system is explored using the Lyapunov theorem. Thus, it is recommended to use the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme for systems such as AUV for better efficacy, as mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {To address the issues of low accuracy, high missed detection rates, and insufficient robustness in strip steel surface defect detection under complex industrial environments, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv8-based detection algorithm named YOLO-KD. Building upon the YOLOv8n baseline model, the algorithm improves model performance through three key modifications: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss function optimization. Specifically, for feature extraction, the original C2f module is replaced with a C2f_KAN structure to enhance feature representation capability, significantly improving the model’s ability to extract defect features. In feature fusion, the conventional UpSample operator is innovatively substituted with the Dynamic Upsampling Operator (DySample), enabling more refined multi-scale feature fusion and effectively enhancing the model’s detection performance for minute defects in complex backgrounds. Finally, regarding optimization objectives, the CIoU loss function is replaced with InnerPIoU to further improve detection accuracy for defect locations on strip steel surfaces. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate that the YOLO-KD algorithm outperforms the baseline model significantly, with the recall rate reaching 75.2% (an increase of 4.3 percentage points), mAP reaching 77.5% (a rise of 2.1 percentage points), and the F1 score rising to 75% (an improvement of 2.25 percentage points). Additionally, the FPS of the YOLO-KD algorithm proposed in this paper reaches 121.7. Compared with the industrial production line requirement of 30-100 FPS, it demonstrates significant performance advantages, meets the real-time requirements for strip steel surface defect detection, and highlights its important engineering application value.},

Employing the non-parallel distributed compensation approach along with Finsler’s lemma, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize an upper bound on train performance and stabilize the system. The corresponding sufficient conditions are deduced in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Pruning redundant parameters is a common remedy, yet fine-grained pruning at the intra-layer level remains difficult due to the large combinatorial search space and the risk of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Fine-Grained Pruning (AFP), an adaptive pruning method operating at intra-layer granularity under a user-defined performance constraint. AFP estimates the importance of prunable components by accumulating gradients during fine-tuning and then performs a binary search over the importance-ranked substructure space in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify the smallest submodel that satisfies the constraint. AFP avoids post-pruning gradient recalibration and efficiently identifies the smallest submodel via binary search, without traversing the full substructure space. Experiments show that AFP adaptively achieves up to 66.56% and 45.84% parameter reductions on the standard Audio Spectrogram Transformer for ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K, respectively, within a 2% drop in accuracy, outperforming popular baselines of static pruning or layer-level pruning in both pruning effectiveness and search efficiency.},

However, wind turbines are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, especially those targeting control protocols and cyber-physical subsystems. In response, resilient control has emerged as a promising approach to enhance system security. Nevertheless, implementing such strategies in wind turbines poses challenges, particularly in maintaining finite-time stability and ensuring consistent power output. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel control framework capable of detecting and mitigating anomalies, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation of wind turbines. Specifically, a resilient pitch angle control method is developed using a combination of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and an adaptive sliding mode controller. The main objective is to regulate the pitch angle to maintain the rated output power while countering cyber threats. Stability is rigorously analyzed through Lyapunov theory, ensuring finite-time convergence of the tracking error. Numerical simulations based on practical wind turbine data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control structure in compensating for both false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {In response to the current problem of relying on manual field observation for detecting and measuring dangerous rock cracks, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv10s model for rock crack recognition and the Edge-based Minimum Width (EMW) for width measurement. The model was trained using a self-made dataset designed explicitly for rock crack detection. We integrated the improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) to form C2fGBA, maintaining the performance while reducing the cost. Meanwhile, Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC) is used to dynamically adjust the receptive field and enhance the perception at different scales. To address the issue of unbalanced sample quality in the dataset, we introduce Wise Intersection over Union (WIoU), which ensures high-quality samples contribute more during training and significantly improve the convergence speed. Additionally, we propose a one-stage width measurement algorithm that simplifies the process and enhances stability compared to traditional skeletonization-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our improved model achieves a mAP@0.5 of 78.5%, with a 3% increase comparing to the original model, and decreases of parameters and FLOPs by 2.9% and 8.2%, respectively. Other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and SSD, achieved mAP@0.5 scores of 64.1% and 63.6%, respectively. The EMW shows stronger robustness to round-shape noise, with an average relative error of 13.4%, compared to 28.4% and 27.2% by two skeletonization-based methods. This paper provides a comprehensive solution for dangerous rock crack detection and width measurement using machine vision, offering valuable technical references for related detection and survey tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cathepsins are lysosomal proteases which are crucial for protein breakdown, bone remodelling and antigen processing and whose dysregulation leads to diseases like cancer, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disorders, making them an important drug target. This study introduces a 1D Convolutional Neural Network-based classification model to enhance screening for potential cathepsin inhibitors, leading to more efficient selection of potential targets for experimental validation. The dataset was gathered from BindingDB and ChEMBL with the target Cathepsin B, S, D and K and the respective half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for their inhibitors, which were categorized into four classes—potent, active, intermediate, and inactive—based on the ranges of IC50 values. The inhibitor ligands were collected in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation and were converted to molecular descriptors using the RDKit library. Due to the large number of features, feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), variance thresholding, and correlation analysis were employed to refine and reduce the initial molecular descriptor set. Data augmentation techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were applied to address the issue of class imbalance. The proposed model achieved high classification accuracies, with Cathepsin B at 97.67%±0.54%, Cathepsin S at 90.69%±0.57%, Cathepsin D at 97.27%±0.23%, and Cathepsin K at 92.03%±1.07%, highlighting the effectiveness of feature selection and deep learning in ligand classification. This approach enhances the identification of potential drug targets for in vitro and in vivo testing, making the process more cost-effective and time-efficient.},

Existing approaches are limited to static texture-based rendering or linear sketch interpretations using symmetric kernels, which restrict their ability to capture physically plausible wrinkle behavior and user control. To address this, our method transforms freehand sketch inputs into spatially diffused wrinkle shapes using a kernel-based framework. The system incorporates asymmetric kernels and mobile device sensors (pressure and tilt) to more accurately reflect user intent and local variation in wrinkle structure. In addition, we introduce an automatic skin texture shading mechanism that simulates shadow effects around wrinkles and an algorithm that generates fine wrinkles based on user-defined parameters such as age. The interface is implemented via real-time UDP communication with a smartphone, enabling immediate visual feedback and an interactive authoring experience. Experimental results on various facial regions and materials demonstrate that our method produces visually rich and anatomically coherent wrinkles. Quantitative evaluation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) shows that our approach outperforms traditional symmetric kernel-based methods. The proposed system has strong potential for application in digital human creation, forensic sketching, and virtual content design.},

This paper presents the radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in a passive optical network (PON). The developed method aims to obtain different parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme as part of a 6G network. In this context, the RF signal is created with configurable universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), and the modulation scheme is modified to study the link’s behavior and to increase the system transmission speed. The first part of the analysis combines RF and optical systems in a co-simulation between MATLAB and OptSim. Meanwhile, the second part reports a real-world implementation of the front-haul link. The objective is to compare the simulation with the real-world results of the designed solution. For this purpose, we find the optimal configuration regarding the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM). In the real implementation, once the front-haul link is configured optimally, the RF signal is transmitted through a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This enables the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the analysis of a 6G sector in a controlled environment. We demonstrate that the implemented solution successfully achieves the required receiver in the PON and ensures minimal received power at the User Equipment (UE). The designed scheme provides an appropriate speed to transmit bursts of data with a very high transfer rate and ultra-low latency, which are essential features for new services in 6G.},

  abstract     = {We present a tunable terahertz metamaterial absorber featuring a fabrication-convenient structure that combines a vanadium dioxide (VO2) square patch and a graphene loop for multifunctional operation. This paper demonstrates an absorber that can selectively operate in narrow-band, dual-band, or broad-band modes. Combining graphene’s electrical tunability with VO2’s thermally induced phase transitions, this absorber realizes dynamically switchable and tunable absorption properties. When VO2 is in its metallic state with chemical potential of graphene, Ef = 0 eV, and relaxation time, τ = 0.1 ps, the structure achieves a broad-band absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz (>90% absorptance from 5.04 THz to 11.35 THz), with an average absorption of 97.24% and a relative absorption bandwidth of 77.12%. By adjusting graphene’s Ef to 1 eV and τ to 0.7 ps, the absorber transitions to a dual-band response, exhibiting peak absorptions of 91.13% at 2.62 THz and 95.48% at 10.81 THz. Conversely, when VO2 remains in insulating state and graphene’s Ef is tuned to 0.6 eV and τ to 0.2 ps, a narrow-band absorption peak of 98.18% emerges. Furthermore, we demonstrate the narrow-band configuration as an ultra-sensitive biosensor, where the resonance peak undergoes a significant redshift while maintaining high absorption efficiency with minimal changes in the surrounding medium’s refractive index. The design exhibits polarization insensitivity and wide-angle stability, validated through electric field analysis, impedance matching theory, and equivalent circuit modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported structure to integrate such a wide absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz with ultra-high biosensing sensitivity of 1929 GHz/RIU in a single fabrication-friendly configuration. These capabilities make the absorber highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, stealth technology, and biochemical sensing.},

Malicious actors may inject false data in communication channels to manipulate the tele-operator’s driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for the safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection merely is not enough and the detection of an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that security incidents across vehicle fleets be detected and logged. Thus, cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled with an attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on steering control commands is created from real vehicle data. The risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-informed context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a feature-enhanced Faster R-CNN algorithm to address the challenges of dense targets, varying object shapes, and complex backgrounds in remote sensing image detection. First, the single-stage model YOLOv8 serves as a baseline for comparative evaluation, revealing the inherent advantage of two-stage detectors in detection accuracy. In scenarios with high-density small objects, the original Faster R-CNN achieves significantly higher accuracy than YOLOv8, though YOLOv8 offers faster inference speed. Based on this observation, the proposed method introduces targeted enhancements to address three key limitations of the original Faster R-CNN: To enhance feature extraction capability, the method integrates Inverted Residual Blocks and Depthwise Separable Convolutions into the ResNet50 backbone. This design strengthens low-dimensional feature representation through a three-phase process of channel expansion, feature extraction, and channel compression. The ReLU6 activation function further improves model robustness; To address insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, the method develops a densely connected feature pyramid network (Dense-FPN). Cross-layer skip connections enable feature maps from different backbone stages to interact densely with each FPN level, facilitating comprehensive fusion of shallow spatial details and deep semantic information; To improve localization accuracy, the method employs a cascaded detection head with a progressive IoU threshold adjustment strategy, refining the bounding box regression stepwise. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed module individually and in combination. Extensive experiments on the DOTA dataset show that the improved algorithm achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.2%, representing a 5.3 percentage point increase over the original Faster R-CNN (72.9%). These results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively resolves critical issues, including feature degradation, semantic inadequacy, and localization bias in remote sensing object detection.},

Existing defenses–such as query monitoring, output perturbation, multi-model output variation, and post hoc verification–fall short in on-device applications where models must run under strict memory and computation budgets. These approaches typically incur high memory or latency overhead due to their reliance on auxiliary models or additional inference-time processing. To address these limitations, we propose CERBEROS, a defense framework designed to achieve security against model stealing with deployability in resource-constrained environments. At its core, CERBEROS introduces a novel neural architecture with multiple classification heads trained jointly for output diversification, while sharing a single feature extraction backbone to minimize unnecessary memory usage. At inference, CERBEROS reveals the prediction of a randomly selected head, thereby misleading adversaries while preserving test accuracy for legitimate users, without requiring separate models or costly output modification. In addition, we integrate structured pruning into training to compress the backbone while retaining the classification heads. This ensures that functional diversity across heads remains achievable even under tight resource constraints. Our experiments show that CERBEROS effectively mitigates model replication attacks while consistently maintaining task performance across widely used convolutional neural networks and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, it achieves significant reductions in memory consumption and inference latency compared to prior defenses, offering a practical and efficient solution for securing on-device AI models.},

This study investigated the effects of a PA’s positive emotional cues on female learners’ learning process experiences and outcomes compared to negative emotional cues. It also explored whether the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs moderated these effects. This study employed a 2 (positive and negative emotional cues) × 2 (high and low similarity) between-subjects experimental design, with 128 female undergraduates randomly assigned to one group. The results indicated that a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as having higher positive and lower negative emotions and being more likely to facilitate learning, more credible, and more engaging than a PA displaying negative cues. Female learners in the positive emotional cue condition showed higher positive emotions and motivation and lower negative emotions and extraneous cognitive load, with no significant differences in learning outcomes compared with those in the negative cue condition. Moreover, the results identified the boundary conditions of the moderating effect of the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs. The similarity in clothing and grooming styles generally did not moderate these effects. An exception emerged under high similarity, where a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as more human-like than one displaying negative emotional cues.},

The approach uses spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) in order to manage hypothetical data which is ambiguous and uncertain, and an adaptive weighting scheme is used to provide dynamic priority of the diagnostic indicators. The essential parameters, including signal attenuation, change in impedance, packet loss and cable ageing, are assessed and ranked systematically to determine the possible faults. The efficiency of the suggested method is proven with the help of theoretical data, which demonstrate a significant increase in detection rate, false alarm rate, and sensitivity to minor flaws in comparison with traditional diagnostic tools. The architecture is strong, scalable, and can be coupled with the already existing network management systems, hence, proactive maintenance and operational resiliency.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of road type classification using deep learning techniques applied to vibrational signals collected from inertial sensors. Two novel architectures, SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, are proposed to achieve high classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The SepRNet-1D architecture is a lightweight 1D-CNN composed of multiple residual blocks, built around a Separable Convolution-1D block, that decomposes the conventional convolution operation into two distinct stages: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. SepSERNet-1D extends this design by incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules to enhance feature recalibration and adaptability. Extensive experiments were conducted on a publicly available benchmark dataset, comparing the proposed architectures with state-of-the-art CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN-LSTM models, several 2D-CNN frameworks and Transformer-based architectures. The evaluations demonstrate the superior classification performance of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Computational experiments further highlight the lightweight design of the proposed models, achieving inference times below 4 ms in TensorFlow Lite format on a 13GB RAM desktop CPU. The results underscore the robustness, versatility, and computational efficiency of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, making them highly suitable for real-world road condition monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have become vital technology for electric vehicle (EV) charging, offering convenience, automation, and resilience in harsh environments. However, the safety and efficiency of these systems are threatened by the presence of foreign objects (FOs) such as metallic debris and biological entities near the power transfer zone. These intrusions can lead to electromagnetic interference, excessive heating, or even hazardous failures. This review comprehensively analyzes Foreign Object Detection (FOD) techniques used in inductive WPT systems, particularly for EV applications. The paper categorizes detection strategies into Metal Object Detection (MOD) and Living Object Detection (LOD). It further classifies them by sensing principles: electrical parameter monitoring, magnetic field sensing, thermal detection, capacitive methods, ultrasonic systems, vision based approaches, and hybrid techniques. A comparative performance evaluation is based on detection accuracy, cost, environmental robustness, and real-time suitability. Additionally, original conceptual figures are included to support understanding of the impact of misalignment and foreign object interference on WPT behavior.Moreover, a finite element modeling based analysis demonstrates the impact of various foreign materials, such as cast iron, steel, aluminum, and water, on coil parameters and WPT efficiency. The paper outlines current challenges, integration issues, and future research directions, including AI driven sensor fusion and the need for standardized validation platforms to enable safe, intelligent, and scalable EV WPT systems.},

  abstract     = {The next generation of automotives will incorporate significant electronic components and sensors to meet the needs for safety, communication, efficient operation and comfort. Automotive parts are largely made from fiberglass composites as they provide a high strength-to-weight ratio, light weight, strength and stiffness in comparison to metal structures. Fiberglass is made of glass fibers and a polymer resin, similar to printed circuit boards. Embedded (or hidden) electronics within such composites have the potential to reduce labor and material costs while also enabling new approaches to systems packaging. Among the many components needed in automotive, antennas are crucial for next-generation vehicle connectivity. Toward this goal, this paper presents a novel process for fabricating conductive fabric antennas and other radio frequency (RF) structures integrated into the fiberglass-based structures. Two different conductive fabrics, copper (total thickness: 60 μm) and stainless steel (total thickness: 50 μm), are used. These conductive fabrics are laminated to fiberglass substrates using a photocurable resin material. This resin is first characterized over a frequency range of 50 MHz - 6 GHz. As a proof of concept, a few RF structures are designed and demonstrated to evaluate electrical performance, including microstrip transmission lines, resonators, half-width microstrip leaky-wave folded antennas, monopole coplanar waveguide (CPW) folded antennas and microstrip patch antennas. Details of the design, fabrication and measurements are provided in this paper.},

Traditional econometric models often struggle with the high volatility and nonlinear patterns inherent in digital asset prices. Long short-term memory networks are effective at recognizing complex patterns, yet they lack interpretability. This study bridges this gap by integrating the error correction model with long short-term memory to improve prediction of Ethereum’s opening price. Using daily price data from January 2018 to June 2024, the model captures both long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term fluctuations, resulting in more accurate forecasts. The findings confirm a significant long-run equilibrium relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The integrated model outperforms standalone models, by achieving a mean absolute error of 46.76, a mean squared error of 5,544.05, and an R-squared of 88%. This study contributes to both econometric and deep learning literature, highlighting Bitcoin’s influence on Ethereum, and offering a practical framework for financial forecasting.

Machine perfusion is a novel organ preservation strategy and a promising technique that can maintain, restore, and regenerate organ functions. The purpose of this study was to develop an extracorporeal small intestinal serosa voltage measurement method to evaluate small intestinal functions during machine perfusion. The eight porcine small intestines were preserved under the following three conditions: simple cold storage (CS, n = 3); hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (MP) after CS (n = 3); and CS using grafts that had undergone warm ischemia (n = 2). After storage under each of these conditions, we performed reperfusion experiments at body temperature using diluted autologous blood and evaluated the status of the small intestine after transplantation. The microcomputer-recorded small intestinal serosa voltage was filtered using an IIR digital lowpass filter. The results reveal that low-frequency potential changes characteristic of the small intestinal serosa voltage were more pronounced in the group that underwent MP (0.19 ± 0.04 Hz; mean ± standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.28), similar to a previous in vivo study. The amplitude root-mean-square (RMS) of the lowpass filtered waveforms showed a negative correlation with glucose concentration change and a positive correlation with oxygen consumption. The small intestinal serosa voltage reflects the health of electrically active cell populations in the muscularis, indicating its usefulness as a method for evaluating small intestinal functions during machine perfusion.},

  abstract     = {In the face of evolving marine ecosystems challenged by global warming, pollution, and overexploitation, the imperative for sustainable management of marine biodiversity is more pressing than ever. Manual monitoring of oceanic species, though vital, proves arduous, time-consuming, and ecologically sensitive. To address this, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key player in species detection and classification. However, the complex task of detecting species in obscured underwater images poses a significant challenge, undermining the reliability of existing computer vision algorithms. This research paper proposes a framework for underwater fish species detection, addressing the limitations of current datasets and models. We present a pipeline integrating underwater image enhancement techniques consisting of Gamma Correction, CLAHE, RGHS and UCM, followed by YOLO-based object detection to improve the identification of underwater entities. The proposed framework demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detection and classification. A dataset is collected meticulously, featuring 20 marine species from the Indian Ocean, which is an improvement in comparison to existing datasets with poor image quality and inadequate annotations. The proposed framework employed not only predicts known species but also detects unknown species. This contribution strives to advance the field of marine biodiversity monitoring, offering a robust and efficient framework for automating fish species detection in challenging underwater environments. For our dataset, we have concluded that YOLOv9 produces the most accurate results among all YOLO models due to its integration of advanced techniques such as the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and Programmable Gradient Information (PGI). GELAN plays a critical role in enhancing YOLOv9’s learning capacity by efficiently aggregating information across layers, minimizing redundancy, and retaining critical features necessary for accurate object detection. Additionally, PGI optimizes the gradient flow during training, allowing YOLOv9 to better preserve and utilize essential information, even in deeper layers. Although, models like YOLOv12 offer lower inference time, YOLOv9 trained on raw dataset still outperforms YOLOv12 trained on enhanced dataset in overall detection accuracy. By addressing the challenge of information loss inherent in deep neural networks through these innovative mechanisms, YOLOv9 achieves exceptional precision and adaptability.},

Second, an adaptive impedance control method was introduced to accommodate varying ground stiffness (ranging from 2×10⁴ N/m to 2×10⁵ N/m), reducing foot penetration depth by 46.7% compared to conventional control. Finally, the STM32 microprocessor was selected as the core, and multiple sensors were installed on the robot to build the adaptive compliant system. These methods were validated on a custom heterogeneous terrain, including a rigid 50 mm obstacle and a soft 30 mm obstacle.

However, face embedding models rely on high-quality images, making them vulnerable to variations in quality, illumination, pose, and occlusion in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based aggregation method for face verification that leverages multiple embeddings to improve the robustness under adverse conditions. The model refines frame-level embeddings computed by a high-performance single-frame feature extractor using a Transformer encoder and is trained with an adaptive triplet loss that applies separate adaptive margins for positive and negative pairs. We train the embedding aggregation model with a two-phase strategy: pretraining with average pooling alignment and fine-tuning with adaptive triplet loss. We train the embedding aggregation model on the YouTube Faces dataset and evaluate it on unseen data from IMFDB, CASIA-WebFace, CCVID, IJB-B, and IJB-C, where it outperforms the baseline on most datasets, especially IMFDB, which has significant variations in pose, lighting, and scene context.

Traditional OCR models struggle with script variations, writing styles, and degraded documents. Advancements in technology are leading to new AI models with improved architecture for handling multiple languages and complex data formats. Despite this progress, a comprehensive evaluation of OCR advancements remains limited. Based on the established preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, this literature review presents an extensive assessment of OCR research to trace the evolution of AI models over the past decade. It explores the transition in AI models, application domains, data types, linguistic coverage, and challenges. Through a detailed analysis of 97 selected studies published during January 2015 - January 2025, key OCR models are identified, and their performance, strengths, and limitations are analyzed. The findings highlight how OCR technologies have evolved to address structured and unstructured text, scene text recognition, and multilingual processing. Unresolved challenges include limited resources for underrepresented languages, high variability in handwritten text, visual similarity among characters, and constraints in real-time OCR applications. To address these issues, several promising approaches are proposed. Key suggestions include self-supervised learning, multimodal AI, automated machine learning (AutoML), AI-assisted postprocessing, tiny machine learning (TinyML), and the creation of joint corpora for script matching. The future recommendations aim to enhance OCR accuracy and tackle the challenges identified for real-time industrial applications.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the attack’s potency, achieving evasion rates of up to 99.53% with an extremely low budget of 1-10 hard-label queries. Our method proves its versatility by successfully targeting models trained on both Boolean and Markov Chain-based features, and importantly, in challenging cross-dimensional scenarios where the attacker’s feature knowledge is limited. Furthermore, a case study on VirusTotal confirms its practical efficacy, reducing detection rates of modern malware by commercial engines by up to 49.7%.

Common parallelization methods include droop control, which avoids critical communication links but is sensitive to line and load parameters, and master–slave architectures, which offer better control capabilities but rely entirely on a single master unit. Additionally, conventional master–slave schemes do not support dynamic role reassignment without interrupting operation. This paper proposes a master–slave control strategy that enables autonomous role reassignment among inverter units in the event of master failure, without requiring system shutdown. The architecture achieves N+1 redundancy and provides all units with grid-forming capability. Role transitions are coordinated through a promotion–degradation mechanism over low-bandwidth communication buses such as CAN. The proposed approach ensures seamless role changes via local AC voltage reference generation, enhancing system robustness and continuity under fault conditions.},

  abstract     = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which provides the rationale behind machine learning decisions, is essential for deploying AI in high-risk domains. However, most XAI methods provide only single-point explanations without indicating their reliability and are often unstable, i.e., small changes in training data can lead to significantly different explanations. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a Bayesian-approximate inverse model explanation method, an extension of AIME that incorporates a Bayesian framework. By modeling the inverse operator of a black-box model probabilistically, Bayesian-AIME estimates feature importance as a posterior distribution. This enables the assignment of 95% credible intervals (CIs) to feature importance scores, facilitating quantitative assessment of explanation reliability. Using the posterior mean also improves explanation stability. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated via three experiments: (1) stability analysis via bootstrapping, (2) validation of CIs on synthetic data with known importance, and (3) case studies on Titanic survival prediction and breast cancer diagnosis. The results showed that Bayesian-AIME outperformed existing methods in terms of stability and conveyed meaningful uncertainty, thus enhancing model interpretability.

  abstract     = {We propose a GA-optimized self-attention LSTM (SAG-LSTM) for multi-asset price forecasting and evaluate it on daily series of crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin, augmented with trading volumes (01-Apr-2021 to 30-Dec-2024). The model marries LSTM sequence learning with a multi-head self-attention layer and a post-attention gating block; a genetic algorithm tunes key hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden size, epochs). Using a 30-day horizon and standard preprocessing with lagged features, we benchmark SAG-LSTM against SA-LSTM and vanilla LSTM on MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 , supplemented by error-trend and residual diagnostics, a forecast coherence score, and inter-asset dynamic/cross-correlation analyses. SAG-LSTM consistently dominates the baselines across assets: out-of-sample R2 rises to 0.90 for oil, 0.94 for gold, and 0.88 for Bitcoin, with visibly flatter error profiles and tighter, near-zero residuals. Inter-asset analyses show time-varying contemporaneous correlations but weak lead–lag effects, clarifying when co-movement is episodic rather than persistent. The largest gains occur in oil, reflecting more structured fundamentals; improvements for gold and Bitcoin are material but tempered by regime shifts and sentiment-driven jumps. Training time is higher due to GA search (≈2,121 s), but inference is fast (≈0.40 s), making the approach suitable for infrequent retraining with near-real-time scoring. Our findings highlight the value of hybrid, optimization-aware deep architectures for medium-horizon forecasting while underscoring the limits of price-volume inputs in sentiment-sensitive markets. These results offer actionable guidance for practitioners and a roadmap for future research and policy.},

First, a machine learning model predicts port authority allocation behavior based on historical data. These predictions capture the port authority’s scheduling behavior which reflects implicit operational patterns by predicting vessel waiting times. Second, these predicted behaviors are embedded into an optimization model through explicit constraints that ensure berth assignments closely align with berth authority tendencies. Using real operational data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against a conventional optimization approach that does not take port authority behavior into account. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the proposed model effectively incorporates port authority behavior by varying the port authority behavior rate parameter.},

Significant imbalances in these parameters can degrade battery performance and reduce reliability. Although active balancing strategies offer greater control flexibility compared to passive methods, they typically face challenges in implementing complex control algorithms, particularly for multi-objective balancing tasks. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced active BMS employing reinforcement learning (RL) to simultaneously minimize deviations in SOC and cell temperature. Specifically, a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based RL agent is trained within a simulation environment and subsequently deployed in a real-world experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can quickly and effectively balance both SOC and cell temperature while efficiently managing the auxiliary power source (APS). This study validates the feasibility of intelligent multi-objective battery state balancing with RL.},

However, their widespread use increases the likelihood of faults, particularly open-circuit faults, and performance degradation due to prolonged or harsh operating conditions. This study investigates the effectiveness of five supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in detecting three fault types in a three-phase controlled rectifier: open-circuit faults, wear-out faults, and their combination. The dataset was generated entirely using a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model of the rectifier, ensuring controlled fault injection for training and evaluation of the classifiers. Four key electrical features: output voltage, voltage ripple, voltage ratio, and impedance, were extracted and analyzed to assess their impact on fault detection performance. The study provides a detailed performance comparison of the classifiers based on classification accuracy and execution time. Results show that the KNN algorithm offers the best trade-off between precision and computational execution time having achieved a precision of 95.59% with an execution time of only 0.014 s while RF achieves the highest precision of 99.88% but with an execution time of 1.258 s.

  abstract     = {Flapping-wing robots have recently attracted significant interest due to their agility and potential energy efficiency compared to traditional aerial systems such as multirotor vehicles. Inspired by bird flight, these novel aerial robots generate thrust and a portion of their lift through wing flapping, while also maintaining lift passively even when the wings are not actively flapping. These robots can switch between the flapping and gliding modes, enabling energy-efficient navigation strategies. However, the design of optimal navigation trajectories that consider the effect of the wind remains unexplored. This paper presents a novel approach to flapping-wing aerial navigation that leverages wind conditions to reduce energy consumption during flight. A physics-based trajectory optimization framework that adjusts the control inputs (flapping frequency and elevator) is formulated based on a dynamic model of the flapping-wing robot, including wind effects. Through optimization-based trajectory planning, our proposed solution adjusts the robot’s flight to take advantage of favorable wind patterns, thereby reducing energy consumption. Our results demonstrate significant energy savings, validating the potential of wind-aware strategies to improve the endurance and efficiency of flapping-wing aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) has materialized as a pivotal technology in wireless communications, addressing spectrum scarcity by enabling dynamic spectrum access. A fundamental component of CR at base transceiver stations is Spectrum Sensing (SS), which detects available frequencies within the licensed spectrum of Primary Users (PUs) to minimize channel interference. This study introduces an advanced SS model that integrates two complementary techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Wavelet Denoising (WD). The proposed WD-based CNN model (WD-CNN) is designed to enhance detection accuracy under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. In the WD-CNN framework, an initial CNN model is employed as a feature extractor, leveraging spectrogram images of received signals to differentiate signal components from noise. The network is trained on diverse signal representations at low SNR to improve robustness. Unlike conventional CNN-based SS approaches, the proposed model further integrates WD with soft thresholding as a secondary denoising mechanism, refining the extracted features to accurately identify PU signals. Performance evaluation demonstrates that WD-CNN significantly outperforms both a CNN model (First CNN model) and transfer learning-based approaches, such as AlexNet. Specifically, at SNR levels of −10 dB and −20 dB, WD-CNN improves detection accuracy by 10.94% and 25.1%, respectively, compared to the First CNN Model. Furthermore, the proposed model surpasses AlexNet by 13.28% at −10 dB and 23.44% at −20 dB. Additionally, WD-CNN achieves a 30.06% accuracy improvement at −15 dB and a substantial 53.44% gain at −20 dB over conventional deep-learning-based SS techniques, while also exhibiting reduced computational complexity. Results demonstrate that the proposed WD-CNN model significantly enhances SS performance under challenging SNR conditions, providing a more robust and computationally efficient alternative to conventional CNN-based detection methods.},

By fusing data from heterogeneous sensors, the system enhances detection robustness while mitigating the privacy concerns associated with constant visual surveillance. When a risk is detected, it immediately alerts medical staff, enabling prompt intervention. The primary contributions of this work are the development of an integrated, multimodal architecture that improves upon single-sensor systems and the implementation of a privacy-conscious framework for continuous patient monitoring, thereby enhancing safety for both patients and healthcare providers.},

  abstract     = {In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The principle of the proposed method relies on leveraging LLMs to automatically assign relevant SDG labels to input texts, enabling scalable, consistent, and efficient monitoring of SDG-related content across different sources. By employing in-context learning and prompt engineering, the study investigates how smaller, more accessible models can achieve high performance with minimal labeled data. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that, on the SDG text classification task, smaller models (such as flan-t5-large) with prompt optimization can achieve macro F1-scores up to 0.75, closely matching the performance of much larger models like gpt-3.5, which attained a macro F1-score of 0.77. Few-shot learning further improved results for challenging classes, reducing the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These findings suggest that, with proper prompt and task adaptation, open-source LLMs can offer a competitive and more accessible alternative for SDG classification, paving the way for broader and cost-effective adoption of automated SDG monitoring tools.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of intelligent power grids into integrated cyber-physical systems has unveiled significant vulnerabilities within their digital measurement frameworks, with false data injection (FDI) attacks presenting substantial threats to grid stability by potentially inciting cascading failures via manipulated control interventions. Although the existing technique of the Variable Dummy Value Model with a non-linear functional form (NF-VDVM) enhances the detection of FDI, it continues to be susceptible to adaptive adversaries who capitalize on deterministic patterns. This study introduces a Dummy-Variable Model with randomized coefficients (RP-VDVM) that fundamentally fortifies security measures through the implementation of dynamic coefficient randomization, effectively eliminating predictable attack vectors. Rigorously assessed on the IEEE 14-bus and other bus systems using authentic PJM load profiles, RP-VDVM exhibits remarkable 95% detection accuracy under a 5% attack intensity (representing a 2.1 times enhancement compared to the NF-VDVM 45%) while maintaining a false negative rate 2% according to North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. An analysis of computational complexity validates the model’s theoretical scalability to more extensive systems, with anticipated execution durations of 480 milliseconds (ms) for 300-bus networks. The proposed model is also compared to other machine learning detectors in order to position it as a viable, high-performance resolution for AC power networks that surpasses both conventional state estimation methods and machine learning-based detection systems in security-critical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Power system survivability, defined as the ability of a system to maintain steady-state functionality under varying operational conditions, reflects its resilience against disturbances. While existing research primarily focuses on physical-layer disturbances, the increasing prevalence of grid-edge DERs, which are primarily used for integrating renewable energy, has significantly expanded the cyber attack surface. As a result, operational disruptions caused by cyber threats are posing significant challenges to system survivability and cannot be overlooked. To fill this gap, we redefine system survivability to incorporate the cyber layer’s status and propose a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to enhance power system survivability against potential cyber-physical threats. In this paper, we first analyze the operational guidelines of systems with a high penetration of DERs under various cyber network conditions and redefine survivability in this context. Next, we focus on the most common cyber threat, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and develop a corresponding attack model. This model allows for the creation of a kernel-based ambiguity set that captures attack uncertainties using historical data. Finally, we transform the proposed DRO model as a tractable optimization problem, with its solution providing an optimal cyber redundancy plan to enhance system survivability in DoS attack scenarios. Simulation results on the IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in improving system survivability. This model can also be expanded to include other types of common attacks and serve as a comprehensive planning tool to improve overall cyber physical survival of the system.},

However, light emitted from the projector can cause severe color distortions, degrading the performance of color-based object detection.In this study, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based image restoration model designed to correct such projection-induced distortions. The model incorporates a color condition vector derived from the projector’s illumination, attention and residual blocks in the generator, and a similarity map module in the discriminator, optimized with WGAN-GP and perceptual losses. By restoring distorted images to their original appearance, the proposed method improves detection accuracy without retraining existing object detection models.Experimental results on a 50,000-image projector–camera dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative restoration models—including Autoencoder, SRCNN, U-Net, ResNet50, and DnCNN—across all quantitative metrics (e.g., LPIPS 0.078, CIEDE2000 5.766, SSIM 0.903). Furthermore, object detection accuracy reached 97.2% for template matching and 99.2% for YOLO, nearly matching the performance on original images. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing object recognition under projection-based environments and indicate its potential for robust deployment in diverse AR and SAR applications.},

  abstract     = {Megaprojects are large-scale, complex, and one-off engineering endeavors that require significant investments from a public or private sector. Such projects generally cost more than a billion dollars, take many years to develop and construct, involve stakeholders both in the public and private sectors, and impact millions of people. Most of the extant megaproject research is concerned with understanding why the engineering management of megaprojects fails so frequently and which dimensions make them so difficult to manage, including size, uncertainty, complexity, urgency, and institutional structure [1]. Recently, the literature on mega-projects has advocated for a convergence of the engineering management and production system management literature. To that end, this paper proposes the use of Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT), where the latter, quite interestingly, finds its origins in the mass-customized production system literature. More specifically, HFGT was developed so that the physical and informatic parts of production system planning, operations, and decision-making are readily reconfigured to support production customization at scale. As the literature on megaprojects is rapidly evolving with a significant amount of divergence between authors, this report builds upon the recent and extensive megaproject literature review provided by Denicol et. al. [1]. The paper concludes that MBSE and HFGT provide a means for addressing many of the concluding recommendations provided by Denicol et. al. MBSE and HFGT not only align with current research on megaprojects but also push the boundaries of how the engineering management of megaprojects can gain a unified theoretical foundation.},

In this paper, we address the cooperative mission planning of multiple UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), where UAVs are tasked with visiting a predetermined set of waypoints, and UGVs act as mobile battery replenishment platforms. The objective is to determine a cooperative mission plan that minimizes the overall mission completion time while respecting UAV flight time constraints. To this end, the mission is decomposed into a set of flight-and-recharge segments, and a genetic algorithm is applied to solve the resulting optimization problem. The proposed approach is evaluated using real-world datasets from three different operational areas. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze parameter settings and validate the robustness of the method. Simulation results show that the algorithm adapts to variations in mission layout and can efficiently plan large-scale missions with thousands of waypoints, involving multiple UAVs and UGVs.},

  abstract     = {In modern smart manufacturing, real-time anomaly detection is critical, yet state of the art (SOTA) models like PatchCore are often too computationally demanding for practical deployment on resource -constrained edge devices. This creates a crucial gap between algorithmic potential and industrial application. To bridge this gap, we propose ViT-Core, a lightweight and efficient model for anomaly detection. Our primary innovation involves replacing the conventional CNN backbone with an efficient Swin Transformer, which reduces feature map dimensionality and, consequently, memory usage. To maintain high accuracy, we employ a Cut-Paste-based transfer learning stage, a self-supervised process that fine-tunes the model to the target data distribution without requiring complex training or additional labels. Evaluated on the comprehensive MVTec AD benchmark, ViT-Core demonstrates a drastic reduction in computational overhead, with memory usage decreased by 49.2% and inference time by 49.5% compared to the PatchCore baseline. This optimization is achieved with a statistically insignificant difference in image-level classification performance (0.9859 AUROC vs. 0.9865). Moreover, ViT-Core excels in anomaly localization, improving the pixel-level AUROC to 0.9817 from PatchCore's 0.9756. Consequently, ViT-Core presents an optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical and scalable solution that enables the widespread deployment of high-performance, real-time quality inspection systems directly on existing industrial hardware.},

  abstract     = {Microplastic (MP) pollution is a serious environmental and public health concern. However, the mechanisms governing MP distribution and transport in rural household environments remain poorly understood. This study presents the first integrated compartmental analysis of MP transfer between outdoor and indoor matrices, including soil, indoor air (inlet and outlet), and reused cooking oil in households located in Karunya Nagar (10.938523°N, 76.743782°E), a rural area in India. Samples were selected based on waste mismanagement profiles and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. High plastic loads detected in the soil samples consisted of polypropylene (PP, 38.21%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 32.85%), polyethylene (22.78%), and polystyrene (PS, 6.16%), likely originating from agricultural films, packaging, and burned household waste. Samples from the air inlet predominantly contained PP (41.72%) and PET (33.94%), suggesting resuspension from contaminated soil due to wind action. Substantial concentrations of PET (42.4%) and PS (25.4%) were detected in reused indoor cooking oil, representing increases of 29.1% and 14.2%, respectively, relative to the air inlet samples. This suggests sorption and thermal transfer during cooking processes in open containers. Increases of 9.4% PP and 0.27% PET in air outlet profiles provide evidence of re-aerosolization during heating and inefficient ventilation. Polymer aging and oxidative degradation were confirmed by spectral intensities at 1783.1 cm−1, 1161.15 cm−1, and 509.21 cm−1. These results reveal a continuous, cyclic pathway of MP entry, accumulation, and secondary emission within rural households, demonstrating an overlooked but critical exposure route that necessitates targeted waste management and health interventions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion and inefficiencies in transportation networks pose significant challenges to road safety, travel times, and environmental sustainability. Traditional traffic management systems, typically reliant on sparse sensor data and rigid models, often fail to provide accurate, reliable, and user-friendly insights. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Traffic State Estimator (PINN-TSE), framework that integrates the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model with advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By combining physics-informed modeling with data-driven learning, the framework ensures accurate and physically consistent predictions of traffic density and velocity. A multicomponent loss function balances data fidelity with physical constraints, while Large Language Models (LLMs) generate contextualized and interpretable traffic insights through a chat-based web interface. The system is designed to handle diverse user queries from precise spatio-temporal inputs to broad, general inquiries, making it highly adaptable for real-world deployment. Validated on real-world data from the US-101 highway, PINN-TSE demonstrated strong performance in capturing shockwave dynamics and transitions between traffic regimes. It achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.4 vehicles per mile (vpm) for density and 3.98 mph for velocity, representing improvements of 60% and 73%, respectively, over purely data-driven models. Furthermore, the shockwave speed error was reduced to 8%, significantly improving the reliability of traffic dynamic predictions. The system’s ability to provide actionable insights, such as identifying congestion hotspots and suggesting alternative routes, highlights its practical utility in real-world traffic management. This work makes three key contributions: (1) a robust PINN-TSE framework that embeds physical laws into neural networks, (2) an intuitive LLM-powered interface for real-time traffic interaction, and (3) a demonstration of its effectiveness in real-world settings. By bridging the gap between complex traffic data and human decision-making, this study advances the field of intelligent transportation systems, offering a transformative solution to safer, more efficient, and sustainable traffic management.},

Gold has been considered as the plasmonic metal for the numerical analysis. The low optical loss of ZEONEX in the visible wavelength region, combined with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) frequency of gold occurring in the same spectral range, makes ZEONEX an excellent material choice for SPR-based sensing applications. On the other hand, the humidity insensitivity of ZEONEX makes it well-suited for sensing applications in aqueous environments. The presence of a large side hole facilitates efficient metal coating and easy introduction/removal of the analyte, without adversely affecting the sensor's performance, even with increased hole size. The sensor’s performance has been numerically evaluated for RI of analytes as well as for detecting thickness of biolayer. The analysis reveals a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 3500 nm/RIU and a high resolution of 2.8 × 10⁻⁵ RIU and an amplitude sensitivity of 696 RIU⁻¹.

Traditional approaches generally lack robustness in handling sparse, noisy interaction data and often ignore pedagogical signals critical to effective guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative framework that seamlessly integrates structured time-series modeling, curriculum-guided transformation strategies, and meta-supervised learning into a unified predictive system. Central to our method is the EduFormer model, a Transformer-based network equipped with knowledge-aware attention and curriculum-conditioned normalization, enabling fine-grained understanding of student behavior over time. Complementing this is Curriculum-Adaptive Meta Supervision (CAMS), a dynamic strategy that modulates training with feedback-driven adaptation and progression-aware. This dual framework not only enhances predictive accuracy but also ensures interpretability aligned with educational theories, contributing to transparent and responsible AI practices in adaptive learning systems. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our approach in personalized prediction and pedagogical coherence, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in next-generation adaptive learning systems.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents a sustainable smart packaging system based on Light-based Internet of Things (LIoT) architecture, termed LIoT-based Active Smart Packaging (LIoT-ASP). The proposed solution integrates Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting (PV-EH) and OpticalWireless Communication (OWC) to enable battery-free, energy-autonomous operation for product condition monitoring in retail and logistics environments. A prototype system was developed using commercially available components, incorporating both visible light downlink and Infrared (IR) uplink channels based on consumer device IR protocol-inspired OWC, adapted for low-power operation. The bidirectional OWC supports a data rate of 1.1 kbps, sufficient for periodic sensing and display updates in low-throughput smart packaging applications. The system employs energy-aware control mechanisms and intermittent operation strategies to manage sensing and data communication under variable indoor illumination. Performance of the LIoT-ASP concept was assessed through the developed proof-of-concept prototype system, followed by experimental validation in a real-world scenario involving temperature-sensitive dairy products. The system successfully detected and reported threshold violations via cloud-connected mobile alerts, demonstrating reliable end-to-end functionality.

  abstract     = {Animals in nature possess unique forms of wisdom. In recent years, scientists have increasingly favored methods for emulating animal behaviors to solve problems. Inspired by the unique reproductive behavior of Rhodeus Ocellatus (RO), which involves adaptive trade-off strategies while searching for clams, we propose the Rhodeus Ocellatus Algorithm (ROA) to solve strongly nonlinear problems like wind farm layout optimization (WFLO). Experiment results show that ROA achieves the first place in all 3 CEC test suites. It outperforms other metaheuristic algorithms, demonstrating excellent robustness and the ability to find better solutions for strongly nonlinear problems. In real-life WFLO cases, ROA significantly improves the annual energy performance (AEP) by 9.47% and reduces the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 8.65% compared with the actual layout. The results also show that ROA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving WFLO problem.},

With projections estimating over 38 billion IoT connections by 2030 [1], the need for scalable and context-aware access control mechanisms is critical. Our approach enforces fine-grained, attribute-driven policies that govern both user access and device participation in collaborative model training—without compromising data privacy. By deploying our system on a simulated, resource-constrained smart home testbed, we demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the poisoning attack surface by preventing unauthorized/stale clients and unauthorized access while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that our method enhances security, preserves the privacy guarantees of FL, and remains feasible for real-world deployment in decentralized smart environments.},

When the number of users exceeds the number of BSAs, user selection becomes necessary, typically managed in zero-forcing beamforming using semi-orthogonal user selection. However, integrating this approach with deep learning-based beamforming remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based unified beamforming and user selection method that scales efficiently with the number of users and BSAs. This approach jointly optimizes beamforming and user selection by introducing a user selection number pursuit algorithm and an attention-based message aggregation. Simulation results showthat the proposed method has better sum rates than conventional methods with less computational complexity. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness against imperfect CSI compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Effective handover management is crucial for maintaining seamless connectivity in wireless networks, and it becomes increasingly challenging in fifth-generation (5G) networks due to strict Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring reliable and low-latency handovers in high-mobility scenarios for 5G networks by introducing a novel pre-connect handover (PHO) mechanism enhanced with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed approach leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a model-free DRL algorithm, to proactively select the best target cell based on prediction for handover. DQN makes predictive decisions based on Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) values and their rate of change among the candidate cells that a user equipment (UE) can receive signals from simultaneously. To further reduce handover latency and improve reliability, the mechanism incorporates packet buffering at the target cell before handover execution. The DQN-assisted PHO solution is implemented and evaluated using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) integrated with NS3-Gym, focusing on real-time online prediction for high-speed mobility scenarios. Furthermore, this paper explores the feasibility of extending the approach to Multi-Agent DRL (MADRL), where agents manage handovers independently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DQN-assisted PHO significantly improves handover success rates by triggering the handover process 800–900 ms earlier, and the MADRL can also achieve up to 100% success rate for specific scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of DRL-based techniques for enhancing handover reliability and performance in 5G and beyond wireless networks.},

The DS-Atlas is built on a dataset of approximately 1.3 million scientific publications from the Elsevier Scopus database, leveraging Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and dimensionality reduction techniques to generate a semantic representation of the DS research. The DS-Atlas provides interactive operations to explore the dataset by allowing users to focus on specific areas, filter by keywords and/or time periods, and uncover thematic connections and research trends. Examples of concrete tasks that can be addressed by DS-Atlas are discussed to show how the proposed solution can support scholars in the data-driven analysis of the data science literature. As a further DS-Atlas contribution, the paper illustrates an analysis of the Data Science discipline in terms of geographical distribution of influential authors, institutions, and journal in the field.

  abstract     = {In secure communications, the primary focus is on safeguarding the content of the message. In contrast, low probability of intercept (LPI) communications prioritize the privacy of the communication process itself. The most restrictive form of LPI communication, where an adversary attempts to disrupt the communication once its presence is detected, is known as covert communication. To hide the transmitted signal in solar radiation, we propose using the Gaussian quantum states generated by the degenerate parametric down-conversion process with signal photons being modulated with the phase-shift keying (PSK). To detect the transmitted signal, we propose transmitting the unmodulated idler photons (serving as the reference) together with modulated signal photons. To establish the link, we use the spatial light modulator (SLM)-based beam steering. We successfully demonstrate dual-pump-lasers-based degenerate entanglement-assisted (EA) LPI communication at 1 Gb/s over a 1.5 km terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) link. For the same link, the number of achievable EA covert bits for EA covert FSO communication is significantly higher compared to the corresponding classical covert communication scheme.},

Industrial experience shows that it is often easier to overlook environmental behaviors than system specifications, largely because environment assumptions are rarely documented and tend to evolve during system development. This lack of explicit handling introduces uncertainty, which can compromise system safety and correctness. While several approaches address this issue at the code level, their impact at the model level remains underexplored. In this paper, we empirically investigate howenvironmental assumptions influence the satisfaction of safety requirements in behavioral system models.We collected 473 environment assumptions from 95 human modelers and examined them using Jackson’s formalization of the environment and the machine. Based on this analysis, we identify five reusable modeling patterns that enable the explicit integration of environment assumptions into state machine designs and demonstrate how these patterns support the safe evolution of models.},

To address the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models such as DeepLabV3+, we propose HSFC-DeepLabV3+, an enhanced model that significantly improves classification accuracy and efficiency. The model introduces four key enhancements: (1) EnhancedMobileNetV2 as the backbone with SEBlock integration for improved feature extraction; (2) SeparableASPP to reduce computational complexity while preserving semantic context; (3) an FPNFusion module for effective multi-scale feature fusion; and (4) a deeper classification head with multi-layer convolutions and Dropout to boost generalization. Additionally, a hybrid data augmentation strategy combining bilinear interpolation, geometric transformation, and Mixup is employed to enhance model robustness. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art models (e.g., HRNet, PSPNet, and variants of DeepLabV3+), demonstrate the superiority of HSFC-DeepLabV3+. The model achieves improvements of 2.55% in overall accuracy (OA), 4.72% in mean pixel accuracy (MPA), and 9.32% in mean IoU (mIoU), while reducing total loss, validation loss, and training time by 0.065%, 0.076%, and 27.58 hours, respectively.

We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs’ ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

Also, an Ethereum blockchain technology (EBT) with a homomorphic encryption algorithm was implemented on the system to ensure that the original information record is maintained, immutable, tamper-resistant, and transparent throughout the electoral process, and stores the information in a decentralized database application. The system achieved 1,424.501 TPS for 10,000 transactions with a mining time of 7.02 seconds. The biometric (facial and fingerprint) authentication achieved a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.00% respectively.

  abstract     = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that stimulates the brain via electric fields induced by pulsed currents in a coil. Beyond coil design, the pulse waveform also affects neuronal activation, though specific mechanisms remain unclear. A waveform optimization method is presented to improve stimulation selectivity, in which a multiscale model with realistic neuronal morphology quantifies the selectivity index, the induced electric field is parameterized for a pulse parameter controllable TMS discharge circuit, and particle swarm optimization is applied to refine the waveform parameters. Optimized waveforms show the potential to achieve higher selectivity than monophasic waveforms, which are known for relatively high selectivity. The results further show that waveform polarity, defined as the ratio of the positive to negative integrated areas of the induced electric field waveform, plays a key role in selectivity across cortical layers. Other waveform parameters, such as the relative order and amplitude of induced electric field levels, may also affect selectivity, with their influence varying according to neuronal morphology and the local electric field distribution. The neuronal time constant also influences how waveform parameters affect stimulation selectivity. Furthermore, stronger polarity-selectivity correlations are often associated with greater alignment between selectivity and coil heating. The proposed method can enhance TMS selectivity by optimizing stimulation waveforms. The identified patterns may help explain variability in TMS outcomes across different waveforms and between individuals, and support the development of personalized designs that enhance stimulation efficacy while minimizing coil heating.},

  abstract     = {The Serbian EMF RATEL system has been monitoring radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) since 2017. As one of five active European systems for continuous monitoring of RF-EMF, it has been able to provide insight into the long-term, temporal variability of the field, especially in areas with increased sensitivity to RF-EMF exposure. Although it has proven its benefits for the general public and the scientific community, the relatively small number of RF-EMF sensors installed at fixed locations reveals its weakness – the inability to cover larger urban areas and provide adequate information on the spatial distribution of the overall field. The distribution of sensors at scattered points is a consequence of the limited costs of system development, as well as the practical difficulties in obtaining an authorized permit to install sensors at a public or private location, which is crucial for the use of any large number of sensors. Consequently, the EMF RATEL network has been upgraded to perform spatial field analysis by integrating the functionality of the drive test, for the first time among existing monitoring systems, developing it to a higher level and achieving progress in RF-EMF research by establishing a single EMF entity for observing both temporal and spatial changes of RF-EMF in the territory of interest. This paper presents some technical details of the integration of the drive test into EMF RATEL, as well as preliminary quantitative results of the corresponding drive test measurements to validate the approach. The aim of this paper is to encourage other, similar EMF monitoring systems to further develop the topic of RF-EMF observation.},

  abstract     = {Waveform design is a key enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems, where low-latency, high-reliability, and energy-efficient communication are essential. Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-variantwaveform, enhances spectral containment through subband filtering while remaining compatible with OFDM-based architectures. However, conventional UFMC receivers incur high computational complexity due to extended 2N-point FFT processing. Motivated by our prior work on reducing FFT operations in multiuser (MU) OFDM systems, this paper proposes a low-complexity UFMC receiver architecture that replaces the conventional 2N-point FFT with an N-point FFT, thereby reducing computational requirements while ensuring accurate signal recovery. A pilot-assisted channel estimation framework based on least squares (LS) estimation and interpolation is further developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address low-complexity receiver design and channel estimation performance in UFMC. Complexity analysis demonstrates substantial reductions in arithmetic operations, while simulation results confirm comparable bit error rate (BER) and channel estimation accuracy under multipath fading. These findings highlight UFMC as an OFDM-compatible waveform suitable for scalable, low-power, and future wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {Image captioning is an emerging field at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). It has shown great potential to enhance accessibility by automatically generating descriptive text for visual content. For visually impaired individuals, such technologies can transform static visual information into meaningful audio narratives and enable them for greater independence and participation in daily life. This study introduces an explainable image captioning framework for visually impaired individuals with an ability to turn visual scenes into descriptive audio output in real-time. Using the Flickr8k dataset, we trained and tested two different models of image captioning. The first model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically ResNet50, as a visual encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a language decoder. This approach incorporates Grad-CAM so that it can visualize spatial areas affecting each word prediction, and it reaches 0.5222 and 0.1069 of BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores. The second and more sophisticated model has the same CNN encoder, but instead of LSTM, it uses a decoder based on Transformer with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding. An attention-based model showed a significant increase in performance to BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores of 0.6163 and 0.2225. It has word-level self-attention visualizations that come convenient to make it more explainable, as it shows inter-token relationships in the process of caption generation. We also suggest an edge-deployable framework of IoT-enabled wearable devices that would allow local image captioning and real-time speech generation without the use of cloud services. A combination of precision, interpretability, and deployment enables the framework to be a powerful and transparent assistive framework to be used in the real world to support visually impaired individuals.},

When class imbalance is coupled with complex data distribution characteristics, such as noise interference, class overlap, and small disjuncts, these interactions significantly exacerbate the degradation of classification model performance. This paper systematically reviews class imbalance learning algorithms in complex scenarios, aiming to clarify the scope of applicability and underlying mechanisms of specific techniques. Through a critical review of the existing literature, the paper not only summarizes the latest advancements in the field, but more importantly identifies two key research gaps: (1) the limitations of current methods in addressing multi-source complexity scenarios, and (2) the ambiguous delineation of the applicability range of target algorithms. To address these issues, we design a systematic experimental framework to evaluate the performance of imbalanced classification across various complex scenarios. This framework reveals the mapping between different data complexities and algorithm effectiveness, and offers recommendations for the compatibility of techniques with specific scenarios. Finally, the paper provides guidance on matching scenarios with techniques, identifies open challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {In tabular data analysis within biomedical research, achieving high model accuracy is often considered a prerequisite for discussing feature importance, as medical practitioners expect the validity of feature importance to correlate with model performance. In this work, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that even low-performing models can provide reliable feature importance on biomedical datasets. We conduct experiments to observe how feature importance rankings change as model performance progressively degrades. Using three synthetic datasets and four real-world biomedical datasets, we compare feature rankings from the full datasets to those obtained after reducing either the number of samples (samples removal) or the number of features (features removal), using different feature stability indices. Our results reveal that, in both synthetic and real datasets, feature rankings remain stable during performance degradation caused by features removal. In contrast, sample removal introduces greater discrepancies in feature importance rankings as performance deteriorates more severely. By analyzing the distribution of feature importance values and theoretically examining the probability that the model fails to distinguish importance between features, we show that models can still reliably identify feature importance despite performance degradation due to features removal. We conclude that the validity of feature importance can be preserved even at suboptimal model performance levels, as long as the degradation stems from insufficient features rather than insufficient samples. This has a considerable impact on biomedical research, where feature importance analysis plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and translational bioinformatics.},

  abstract     = {The decomposition of monolithic systems into microservices architectures has become a critical challenge in modern software engineering. Whereas traditional approaches rely primarily on structural analysis, emerging semantic approaches promise more accurate decomposition by incorporating the meaning-aware analysis of software artifacts. This systematic literature review presents the first comprehensive analysis of semantic approaches to microservice identification, examination techniques, evaluation methodologies, and practical adoption challenges. We systematically searched the Scopus database for semantic-specific terms. After applying strict inclusion criteria, from an initial corpus of 40 publications, 17 high-quality papers were selected, representing a 48.6% selection rate. Each study was analyzed for its technical approach, evaluation methodology, and practical applicability. Four distinct categories were identified: NLP-based (41%), hybrid (35%), ontology-based (18%), and AI-enhanced (6%). Hybrid approaches demonstrated superior performance (F1-score: 0.81), whereas domain specific models show 15-20% accuracy improvements. The selected studies were published between 2020-2025, with the majority concentrated in 2025. This temporal concentration reflects the emergence of semantic approaches as distinct research areas. Our search covered 2010-2025 but found limited genuine semantic work in earlier years, indicating that semantic microservice identification is a recent phenomenon as evidenced by the current research surge [1], [2]. Semantic approaches consistently outperform traditional methods, achieving 23-45% improvements in coupling reduction and 15-38% enhancements in cohesion. However, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks, limited tool maturity, and insufficient industrial validation. The field must focus on benchmark development, production-ready tools, and industrial case studies.},

  abstract     = {The problem of decoupling capacitor placement is a critical challenge in modern hardware design, as it significantly impacts power integrity and overall circuit performance. The rapid evolution of hardware to meet increasing performance demands presents significant challenges for traditional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which often suffer from prolonged runtimes and limited scalability. Recently, sequential decision-making methods have gained attention for automating partial solutions in hardware design. However, their dependence on a strict ordering of decision elements introduces order bias, which may degrade performance and overlook valid solutions when the optimal solution set is permutation-invariant. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for the problem of decoupling capacitor placement, leveraging its permutation-invariant nature to address these challenges. Unlike sequential decision-making methods that introduce order bias, our approach is the first to leverage a non-autoregressive diffusion model for this task, directly generating an optimized placement solution by iteratively refining a noisy initialization. This allows the model to efficiently explore the solution space while ensuring consistency and high-quality placements. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, including search-based heuristics, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, in both placement performance and data efficiency.},

When a functional test sequence is used for logic diagnosis, it is important to ensure that test compaction does not eliminate useful diagnostic information. This article addresses this problem for the first time by describing a new test compaction procedure for functional test sequences. The ability of a sequence to support logic diagnosis is assessed by performing diagnostic fault simulation. To limit the computational effort, the test compaction procedure incorporates a dynamically changing parameter that limits the number of times diagnostic fault simulation is carried out during compaction. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure, and the use of observation points.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotics offers a flexible alternative to rigid systems, enabling safe and adaptive interaction in biomedical, wearable, and unstructured environments. Among available actuation methods, soft electromagnetic actuators are notable for their fast response, low operating voltage, and ease of integration. However, some designs require pre-stretching mechanism, which produces an external force to maintain the separation between the coil and permanent magnets. Additionally, there is a mechanical complexity and difficulty in calibrating the spring parameters precisely. Furthermore, the pre-stretching mechanism increases the electromagnetic force required to counteract the opposing spring force, leading to a significant increase in power consumption. Therefore, this paper presents MagFlex V-2, a soft actuator featuring an air gap between a coil and permanent magnets, encapsulated in silicone to eliminate the need for pre-stretching. Three evaluation approaches were employed: (1) experimental testing across 0–45 V, (2) finite element simulation in COMSOL, and (3) analytical modeling using energy-based methods and a magnetic dipole field. MagFlex V-2 exhibited voltage-induced contraction, reducing its length from 17.1 cm to 15.1 cm at 42.5 V. The displacement followed a nonlinear voltage relationship, becoming more linear with increased silicone stiffness. In addition, electromagnetic force showed high sensitivity to voltage and air gap, peaking at 7.03 N (analytical) and 7.43 N (numerical) at 0.5mmand 45 V. Furthermore, statistical analysis (p > 0.05) confirmed that silicone damping and elasticity were not significant. Finally, electrical behavior showed close agreement among analytical, numerical, and experimental results at low currents, with deviations at higher voltages attributed to thermal effects.},

Conventional L₁ adaptive control methods typically require accurate knowledge of specific parameters, which may be difficult or impractical to obtain. Furthermore, some parameters vary dynamically with system behavior, and treating them as constant can result in degraded performance. To overcome this limitation, a type-2 fuzzy neural network is employed to compute the low-pass filter parameters online and in real time.

The DC-DC converter based-BLDCM drive topology is widely preferred to suppress CCRs. The improved characteristics such as low mechanical oscillation and stiff-speed regulation of BLDCM drives further introduces undamped AC signals termed as switching frequency harmonics (SFH) which results destabilization of DC-link voltage (DCLV). The different breeds of filter techniques have been recommended to stabilize the DCLV. However, the recommended filters are composed on the basic of concept of low pass filter (LPF) or band-pass filter (BPF). In addition, these filters require a precise coordination with active compensation, current reference and nonlinear interaction. In this context, a quasi-proportional-resonant-compensator (QPRC) has applied to stabilize the DCLV. The QPRC is investigated for an in-front zeta converter (IFZC) assisted-BLDCM drive. The IFZC primarily handles voltage regulation, while the QPRC is incorporated to suppress the SFH of the DCLV. A hardware prototype has been developed, and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization strategy and design.

If the output of each power source is connected in parallel to the dc-link and a converter with the same power rating is used, a redundancy effect can be obtained. The operation of the hybrid PCS system is determined by the state of charge (SOC) of the ESS battery, and the operating power is determined by the PV generation and grid demand power or ESS battery charging demand power. In this paper, we design a Markov model that considers the reliability of the hybrid PCS, the operating mode, the operating power according to the PV generation and demand power, the operating power change due to partial failure, and the on-load and standby redundancy methods, and analyze the reliability along with the verification of the operation through simulation to present design guidelines for securing high reliability of the hybrid PCS system. The result of the reliability analysis based on an operating temperature of 50°C is that the standby method MTTF is 9.8% longer than the on-load method. Also, when PV generation exceeds demand power, the average lifespan is 23.4% longer than below the demand. When demand is 3 kW, the lifespan increases by 31.8% compared to 5 kW, and when demand is 1 kW, the lifespan increases by 12.1% compared to 3 kW.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose significant challenges in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), where the centralized controller often becomes a critical point of failure. As attack strategies grow more advanced, including low-rate and zero-day attacks, there is an increasing need for detection systems that offer both high accuracy and efficient, adaptable performance. In this study, we propose an ensemble-based intrusion detection framework for SDN environments. A central element of the framework is a hybrid feature selection approach that combines Random Forest (RF) feature importance with the Banzhaf Power Index (BPI), a concept from cooperative game theory. This method helps select features that are both relevant and complementary, reducing redundancy and lowering computational demands. The framework incorporates several machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. These models are integrated into four ensemble configurations using voting strategies. We evaluate the framework using two datasets: CIC-DDoS2023, which represents recent and diverse attack types, and a flow-based SDN dataset that simulates controller-targeted attacks. The ensemble models showed strong detection performance across both datasets and in many cases, exceeded existing baseline methods. Beyond accuracy, we also analyzed training time, inference latency, memory usage, and model size. One important observation is that resource usage is closely influenced by the number and type of selected features, emphasizing how dataset characteristics impact deployment decisions. While some models trained in under five seconds with very low memory requirements, others required significantly more resources. Overall, the framework offers a practical and effective solution for real-time DDoS detection in SDN systems.},

Existing heuristic methods lack scalability, and static network embedding techniques fail to capture evolving topologies. This paper proposes ANE-MiST, a novel framework integrating Attributed Network Embedding with Minimum Spanning Tree (MiST) optimization to address these challenges. By leveraging graph machine learning, our model optimizes the design speed and pipe usage for constructing network layouts, where the pipes cover all nodes based on node properties such as geographical coordinate, elevation, and demand volume. Through the concept of network representation learning, the model can capture the dynamics of changes in the water pipeline network layout, whether due to obstacles or sudden destruction such as natural disasters. The model can reconstruct layout without starting from scratch when changes occur in the network. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable water infrastructure design and paves the way for future integration with hydraulic simulation and hybrid graph learning models.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns such as implausible semantic associations (e.g., treating "nostril" as perceivable through smell) related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a practical and cost-effective method for measuring the pitch location in baseball using only a single camera and a radar gun. Pitch location, defined as the position at which a baseball crosses home plate, is a critical metric for both pitchers and batters aiming to improve performance. While commercial systems such as Trackman, Hawk-Eye, and Rapsodo can measure such data, their high cost and complexity limit accessibility, especially for amateur teams. To address this issue, the proposed method estimates the distance between the ball and camera by leveraging the ball’s physical displacement, as measured by a radar gun, and its corresponding pixel displacement in consecutive video frames. Additionally, the angular position of the ball is computed based on its location in the image plane. These parameters are then combined to reconstruct the 2D pitch location. The method is robust against rolling shutter distortion, with detection performance enhanced through a custom-trained YOLO model. Experimental validation was conducted on actual baseball fields, comparing results with those from Rapsodo and an existing monocular method. The proposed method demonstrated superior accuracy, with statistically significant reductions in estimation error. Given its simplicity, low cost, and field-tested accuracy, this approach offers a highly accessible solution for pitch location analysis, particularly in training environments lacking access to high-end tracking systems.},

In this model, in addition to voltage, current, and temperature, it incorporates dV/dt, integrated current, and their exponential moving averages to capture both transient and long-term electrochemical behavior. Comprehensive benchmarking against LSTM, GRU, and LSTM-DNN architectures is conducted using fixed-temperature training data and evaluated under varying ambient conditions ranging from −20°C to +25°C. Results show the proposed model consistently outperforms its counterparts, achieving lower RMSE and MAE across all scenarios, well bounded under 1.09% and 0.85%.

However, conventional OTFS modulation suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), hindering its practical implementation in ground mobile terminals. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a PAPR reduction method based on precoding discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-spread) technique. First, the information symbols are precoded, followed by DFT-spread, and finally inverse discrete Zak transform (IDZT) is applied to achieve OTFS modulation. The precoding DFT-spread ensures that the OTFS modulation output approximates a repetition of the input, thereby achieving the PAPR performance comparable to single-carrier modulation. Furthermore, the proposed method simplifies the modulation architecture by replacing conventional inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT) and Heisenberg transform (HT) with IDZT, effectively reducing implementation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that this method reduces the PAPR of OTFS signal by up to 4.0 dB, outperforming traditional DFT-spread techniques by approximately 1.4 dB.},

  abstract     = {Steganography, the practice of concealing information within seemingly ordinary media, is essential for protecting sensitive data in today’s digital era. As cyber threats evolve and data transmission grows, ensuring secure and undetectable information hiding becomes increasingly challenging. This study introduces two novel Contrast Channel Embedding (CCE) techniques to optimize steganographic embedding: Mid-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (MCCE) and Extreme-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (ECCE). MCCE targets mid-range contrast areas, avoiding extremes, while ECCE leverages extremely low and high contrast regions, excluding the mid-range. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on smooth or textured regions, our approach combines gradient-based contrast analysis with RGB contrast thresholds to identify ideal embedding zones. Low-contrast areas enhance imperceptibility by minimizing visible artifacts but limit embedding capacity. In contrast, high-contrast regions offer greater capacity and robustness due to pixel variation, though they must be selected carefully to preserve image quality. We employ Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution to embed the hidden data efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that MCCE and ECCE significantly enhance steganographic performance over traditional LSB-based techniques in terms of imperceptibility, maintain a reasonable payload capacity, and improve robustness against detection. Specifically, MCCE achieves PSNR improvements of up to 23.077%, 17.942%, and 12.490%, while ECCE achieves 23.050%, 17.915%, and 12.463%. Both methods also yield consistently higher SSIM scores across various images with a fixed message length of 8192 bytes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in providing a comprehensive and secure solution to conceal information in digital images while maintaining visual fidelity.},

For large-scale image reconstruction, our approach uses fully connected layers in a distributed manner, enabling memory-efficient reconstruction even with limited GPU resources.

Our proposed neural network-based method named MSSPlace utilizes images from multiple cameras, LiDAR point clouds, semantic segmentation masks, and text annotations to generate comprehensive place descriptors. We employ a late fusion approach to integrate these modalities, providing a unified representation. Through extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and NCLT datasets, we systematically analyze the impact of each data source on the overall quality of place descriptors. Our experiments demonstrate that combining data from multiple sensors significantly improves place recognition model performance compared to single modality approaches and leads to state-of-the-art quality. We also show that separate usage of visual or textual semantics (which are more compact representations of sensory data) can achieve promising results in place recognition.

The data driven methods often face challenges such as poor adaptability to varying operational conditions and a lack of physical interpretability necessary for understanding degradation processes. By embedding domain-specific physical principles into machine learning models, physics-based features enhance the accuracy and robustness of RUL predictions, delivering reliable results across diverse scenarios.

Results demonstrate that physics informed features using LSTM models outperform other approaches, excelling at capturing temporal degradation patterns and delivering robust, interpretable RUL predictions. It is observed that results of LSTM with the involvement of physical insights have achieved greater results when validated against recent studies based on the error measuring indicators, Root Means Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Existing approaches either rely on laser measurement of a large number of configurations followed by offline selection of an optimal subset—an inherently time-consuming process—or generate optimal configurations solely from joint-space constraints, which are easily affected by the robot’s workspace and the laser tracker’s line-of-sight limitations. In this study, we propose a novel optimization framework that, on the basis of joint-space constraints, incorporates both Cartesian-space constraints and laser-tracker line-of-sight constraints to formulate an optimization model for generating an optimal calibration configuration set. A hybrid WPSO-SQP algorithm—combining the global search capability of inertia-weighted particle swarm optimization (WPSO) with the strong convergence properties of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for nonlinear constrained problems—is then employed to identify the optimal configuration set. To ensure uninterrupted line-of-sight during measurement, a simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the measurement sequence of the selected calibration configuration set. Experimental validation on a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot demonstrates that the proposed method substantially improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of kinematic calibration.},

The framework operates in five systematic stages: (1) constructing a bias dataset from social group–bias property tuples, (2) generating yes/no, wh-, and choice-based prompts using NLP techniques, (3) applying n-gram, cosine similarity, and embedding-based methods for bias detection, (4) employing NSGA-II to select an optimized “Prompt Set,” and (5) measuring fairness via Bias Detection Rate and Preference Rate across demographic categories.We evaluate FairPrompt on two state-of-the-art conversational AI systems—BlenderBot (400M parameters) and GPT-3.5 Turbo—using Random Sampling and BiasAsker as baselines. Across 30 experimental runs with a 30% prompt sample size, FairPrompt demonstrates up to 50% reduction in computational cost while achieving significantly higher bias detection rates and broader coverage across multiple social dimensions (e.g., gender, race, body, ability). These results establish FairPrompt as a scalable, model-agnostic framework for fairness testing in conversational AI, offering a more efficient and comprehensive pathway toward building robust and socially responsible AI systems.},

  abstract     = {The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to deliver ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high data rates, enabling advanced applications such as autonomous unmaned aerial vehicles (UAV) swarms and aerial edge computing. However, realizing this vision in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) requires intelligent and adaptive clustering mechanisms to ensure efficient routing and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-driven framework for dynamic cluster formation and cluster head selection in 6G-enabled FANETs. The system leverages mobility prediction using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a composite optimization strategy based on signal strength and spatial proximity to identify optimal cluster heads. To evaluate the proposed method, comprehensive simulations were conducted in both centralized (5G) and decentralized (6G) topologies using realistic video traffic patterns. Results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in delay, jitter, and throughput, in decentralized scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning with clustering techniques to enhance scalability, stability, and performance in next-generation aerial networks.},

Accurate Doppler bandwidth estimation is critical for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SAR imagery by preserving dominant signal components and suppressing noise. Conventional models, which rely solely on the Azimuth Antenna Pattern (AAP), assume uniform signal attenuation during target illumination. However, in short-range configurations, variations in slant range cause pronounced non-uniform (time-varying) signal attenuation due to propagation loss. This effect can potentially introduce systematic errors in Doppler bandwidth estimation when conventional AAP-based models are applied. The proposed approach incorporates both the AAP and the non-uniform attenuation, resulting in more accurate bandwidth estimates. Experimental validation with simulated and real SAR data demonstrates the improvements. Furthermore, it is shown that the enhanced estimation accuracy leads to measurable SNR gains, underscoring the practical importance of precise Doppler bandwidth estimation in short-range applications.},

This domain faces unique challenges including domain-specific terminology, nested entity structures, and Chinese language processing complexities. This work presents GP-NER, a novel span-based neural framework designed to extract structured entities from Chinese power grid voice dispatch instructions, including domain-specific terminology and nested entity structures. Our architecture combines Chinese-RoBERTa with whole-word masking, BiLSTM sequential modeling, and dual feed-forward networks to generate specialized representations for entity classification and span encoding. GP-NER integrates OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text conversion with downstream entity extraction across nine power grid-specific categories. The core innovation lies in our similarity-based span-type matching mechanism that models semantic relationships between entity types and candidate spans, enabling robust handling of nested and overlapping entities prevalent in technical dispatch communications. Comprehensive 10-fold cross-validation on 2,000 authentic dispatch recordings demonstrates superior performance with 94.93% precision, 96.10% recall, and 95.51% F1-score, significantly outperforming competitive baselines including recent span-based methods. Statistical significance testing confirms these improvements (all p < 0.05). Ablation studies validate individual component contributions, while evaluation on public Chinese NER benchmarks demonstrates generalizability beyond the power grid domain. The framework shows consistent effectiveness across all entity categories, with F1-scores ranging from 94.85% to 95.99%. GP-NER provides an effective solution for domain-specific entity extraction in power grid environments, advancing intelligent grid management through enhanced automated processing and operational safety.},

However, the nonlinear dynamics of electrochemical processes and multi-source battery data present major challenges for data-driven classification tasks. This paper introduces a multimodal Vision Transformer-based framework that leverages feature-level fusion, Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection, and an ensemble decision strategy integrating Support Vector Machine and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. In the proposed approach, voltage, current, and temperature time-series data are transformed into image representations using Continuous Wavelet Transform, and modality-specific features are fused before classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the full-modality configuration achieves superior performance, with a test accuracy of 92.69%, F1-score of 91.27%, and recall of 90.70%. Also, for single-modality fusion scenarios the framework achieves up to 86.89% test accuracy, while dual-modality fusion configurations yield results up to 91.50%, confirming the consistent performance gains obtained as additional modalities are integrated. The application of Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection enhances validation and test accuracies by up to 2.81%. Furthermore, by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance the dataset against class imbalance, the final test accuracy reached 92.93%. SHAP-based interpretability analysis reveals that current-derived features contribute most significantly to class discrimination, improving both transparency and feature relevance. The framework maintains consistently high performance across single, dual, and full-modality scenarios, ensuring the robustness and practical potential for real-world battery diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {The creation of data-driven models for classification problems requires increasing transparency and inferential explainability, especially in high-stakes domains such as health-care, finance, and policy making. Rule-based systems are widely regarded as a strong candidate for the development of models that are also comprehensible to humans. However, the generated rules are often considered individually with minimal or no consideration of their interactions. This research focuses on the adoption of computational argumentation techniques, which allow for rule-interaction for enhanced explainability. In other words, rules can be revoked when new information is introduced, essentially achieving the notion of non-monotonicity. In detail, an empirical work was designed to automatically extract inference rules from datasets of various multi-class classification tasks by using the Logic Learning Machine (LLM) approach. In turn, these rules were integrated within a structured argumentation framework, able to employ abstract argumentation semantics for conflict resolution among contradicting inferences. Findings demonstrated that the LLM technique can indeed extract compact rules with varying degrees of interpretability and predictive power. Furthermore, the argument-based models built on these rules demonstrated improved inferential and explanatory performance on certain datasets. Examples show how a Cohen’s kappa coefficient improved from 0.85 to 0.99 when applying the argumentation-based conflict resolution strategy to the same set of rules generated by LLM. The contribution to the body of knowledge offered to the community is both a customisable approach for rule-extraction from datasets for multi-class problems, via hyperparameter tuning, and a transparent integration strategy with computational argumentation, which is able to enhance human understanding and support justifiability.},

This paper bridges that gap by offering both a comprehensive overview and a detailed analysis of the underlying modulation-induced loss mechanisms. Specifically, the study characterizes time-harmonic losses arising from copper, iron, and magnet components under voltage-source inverter operation. Furthermore, conventional evaluation metrics, such as the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), are analyzed for their effectiveness in capturing time-harmonic motor losses. A novel matrix impedance measurement method is used to capture the motor’s wide-frequency response including the quantification of parasitic inter-winding and winding-to-stator capacitances. Loss-equivalent parameter fitting is employed to achieve high modeling fidelity with manageable computational demands. Incorporating parasitic effects into the overall loss model reveals a distinct switching-frequency dependency in overall system losses. This insight enables the precise determination of an optimal inverter switching frequency that minimizes modulation-induced losses, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of electric drive systems.},

  abstract     = {Intermittent fault diagnosis (IFD) is a vital subject in modern communication and computing networks. Unlike permanent problems, which are simpler to discover and localize, intermittent defects appear irregularly, disappear autonomously, and frequently resemble natural network variations. This renders them more difficult to track, yet significantly disruptive. Modern deep learning methods, such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTMs and their variations, sometimes don’t take long-term dependencies or localized spatial anomalies into consideration. This causes a lot of false alarms and makes the accuracy go down. The lack of annotated intermittent failure datasets and their irregularity make it much harder to train and generalize models. To solve these problems and make dataset-related problems less of a problem, there is a need to create a hybrid strategy that combines Transformer-based temporal modelling with CNN-based spatial feature extraction and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN)-based synthetic data augmentation. The proposed method meets the immediate need for a precise, scalable, and robust IFD solution that works in real time in mission-critical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, that cuts down on false alarms, and that makes the network more reliable. Meticulous preprocessing steps, including normalization, window sliding, and balancing, ensured that the model training received optimal input. The enhanced datasets indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Convolutional Autoencoder.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an enhanced control strategy for a three-phase four-wire four-leg rectifier (3P4W4LR), aimed at improving dynamic and steady-state performances, disturbance rejection, robustness, and implementation efficiency. A nonlinear varying-gain observer (NVGO) integrated with a simple PI controller is proposed for the outer loop to regulate the DC-link voltage under different internal and external disturbances. Unlike traditional disturbance observers, which are highly sensitive to measurement noise and compromise transient response when gains are reduced, the proposed NVGO employs a variable-gain mechanism. High gain value is used during transients to ensure rapid disturbance estimation and rejection, while low gain value during steady-state minimizes noise sensitivity and estimation error. This results in superior disturbance rejection, improved dynamic response, reduced DC link voltage steady-state error, enhanced noise immunity, increased reliability, and reduced system size and cost. For the inner loop, a Grid-Voltage-Modulated Direct Power Control method based on super-twisting sliding mode control is introduced. Operating directly in the synchronous reference frame without relying on phase-locked loop or Park transformations, this approach simplifies implementation while delivering faster transient response, improved steady-state accuracy, and greater resilience to grid current system uncertainties and disturbances. To ensure robust performance, the closed-loop regional stability of the proposed NVGO with PI controller is rigorously analyzed using a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated through both simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Extensive testing under dynamic load conditions, different grid voltage conditions, and DC-link capacitance uncertainty demonstrates the controller’s robust performance and practical viability.},

The dedicated device includes a sensor and actuators in order to assess dynamic control and feedback mechanisms. The comparison comprises two parts: a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis assesses each framework’s architectural and functional dimensions, including modularity, scalability, adaptability, reconfigurability, migratability, protocol support, control integration, intelligence localization, DT aggregation, and provision type. The quantitative analysis benchmarks the frameworks using key performance metrics: synchronization latency, data processing throughput, operational availability, scaling efficiency, reconfiguration time, event response time, and resource utilization cost. The UniTwin framework stands out particularly in terms of modularity, scalability, and real-time efficiency and dominates in the dynamic reconfigurability and integration depth of the DT deployment.},

An empirical approach was adopted, involving 232 university students who voluntarily participated in the experiment. Prototypes of three well-known Massive Open Online Courses platforms (i.e., Coursera, Udemy, and edX) were developed to assess how various user interface design patterns influence user experience. The findings revealed that the aesthetic design of Coursera, including color scheme, content organization, was perceived as the most visually appealing, while Udemy received higher ratings for its typography, i.e, font size, type, and button shape. Coursera also outperformed the other platforms in terms of navigation (e.g., tab navigation, hamburger menu, drop-down, floating action button, listview), customization features (e.g., search filters, font, and background settings), and feedback mechanisms (e.g., toast messages, error alerts, progress indicators, confirmation prompts, and system status updates). Overall, participants reported higher satisfaction with Coursera, and its interface was associated with a lower cognitive load compared to Udemy and edX. These results underscore the importance of thoughtful user interface design in enhancing usability and reducing cognitive effort in mobile learning applications.},

  abstract     = {While smart contracts enhance efficiency and transparency, they raise legal and technical issues. Smart contracts do not involve face-to-face negotiation or discussion, which contributes to difficulty in confirming that both parties agreed to the terms. Moreover, while smart contracts that encode the intention of the parties show up on the blockchain as digital signatures or as preprogrammed actions, this begs the question as to precisely whether this reflects their intention and mutual consent in the first place. Furthermore, the execution of offer and acceptance in an automated manner poses a challenge to the traditional principles of contract law, as it may rely on adhesion contracts that limit the opportunities for negotiation. Moreover, the verification of legal capacity of the parties identified under a pseudonym is another challenge in a decentralized blockchain environment, especially for cross-border transactions that set varying legal standards. Through a mixed-methods approach of thematic analysis of interviews and literature review, the research responds to these challenges, across practical and theoretical domains. Proposed solutions include biometric identification, digital identity schemes, and AI-assisted consent verification. The study recommends aligning traditional legal principles with technological advancements and fostering international collaboration to create robust frameworks, ensuring fairness and enforceability in smart contracts. This study concludes that a twin-track approach—combining technological improvements with regulatory adjustments—is critical for ensuring the fairness, enforceability, and reliability of smart contracts.},

Conventional federated learning (FL) approaches falter under non-IID data distributions, adversarial threats, and rapidly changing traffic conditions. This paper introduces FLAA-V2V, a novel FL framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) A reinforcement learning-based adaptive aggregation engine dynamically weights vehicle contributions using context-aware metrics (data quality, network stability), reducing communication overhead by 23% versus FedAvg; (2) A hierarchical privacy mechanism combining Local Differential Privacy (LDP) and Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption (LHE) secures V2V exchanges while achieving 92.3% collision-avoidance F1-score under attacks; and (3) A meta-learning drift detector with Kolmogorov-Smirnov validation and gradient compensation reduces accuracy degradation by 18.7% in non-stationary environments. Evaluated on 200+ autonomous vehicles, FLAA-V2V sustains sub-300ms latency at 95% density and demonstrates 16.1% higher adversarial resilience than state-of-the-art FL baselines. This framework establishes a new paradigm for secure, adaptive federated learning in mission-critical ITS applications.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to reduce the annotation costs of training semantic segmentation networks by leveraging weak supervision. Although class labels are a widely used form of weak supervision, annotating all object categories within scene-level images remains both labor-intensive and error-prone, since annotators must exhaustively verify the presence of multiple classes. To overcome this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that relies on only a single positive class label per image as supervision, substantially simplifying the annotation process and enabling more scalable dataset construction. However, using single positive labels introduces challenges, as they can lead to degraded pseudo-semantic masks and hinder network training. To address this, we propose Prediction Score Thresholding (PST) and Permanently-corrected Label Transfer (PLT) to alleviate the degradation problem. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Microsoft COCO 2014 demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance both the quality of the pseudo-semantic mask and the overall WSSS performance, even with extremely sparse supervision.

While manual analysis methods are complex and labor-intensive, deep learning methods have shown potential for automated analysis of the scans. While existing models allow a binary classification, this study uses a novel deep learning-based approach to classify Ground Penetrating Radar B-scan radargrams into three subsurface categories (utilities, cavities, and intact zones) to account for the complexity of real-world subsurface conditions. A ResNet50 model is used with a novel edge preserving preprocessing step to enhance the quality of input data, with the aim to reduce noise in the radargrams while keeping important structural details unblurred. The model shows significant improvements when domain-specific filtering is applied. Balanced accuracy increased from 93.06 % to 96.00 %, setting a new benchmark for Ground Penetrating Radar-based multi-class classification. The results show that combining image enhancement with deep learning can improve the analysis of underground imagery.

In this work, we investigate and compare two text-to-image generative models, DALL·E 3 and Gemini, based on their ability to understand, capture, and represent various aspects of the Saudi cultural legacy, including regional cuisine, traditional fashion, and prominent sites. We utilized a variety of hand-crafted and LLM-generated prompts (using GPT-4) to guide the text-to-image models in generating images of Saudi cultural artifacts, and subsequently evaluated the outputs. We rely on human evaluation guided by a three-fold framework to assess key dimensions of the generative model performance: cultural awareness in the LLM-generated prompts, cultural sensitivity and authenticity in the text-to-image output, and visual and semantic fidelity of the generated images. Our findings indicate that, despite generating high-quality images, both models often struggle to faithfully represent specific cultural artifacts. Hence, further research is needed to improve cultural representation in text-to-image models and to enhance their understanding and perception of diverse cultures.},

However, this field relies on sensitive student data, creating substantial privacy risks and hindering open research. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real data without exposing personal information. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for generating, evaluating, and utilizing synthetic student data based on the widely used Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). We employ two state-of-the-art synthesizers, the Gaussian Copula (GC) and Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), to create synthetic versions of the dataset. The synthetic data are rigorously evaluated against the original data along three critical axes: (1) machine learning utility for predicting student dropout and final grades, (2) statistical quality using the SDMetrics library, and (3) privacy risk via a membership inference attack. Our results show that CTGAN-generated data retains 93.1% of the predictive utility for dropout classification, a statistically significant finding, while also offering strong privacy protection. Conversely, the GC synthesizer produces data with higher statistical fidelity but lower machine learning utility. This work demonstrates that modern synthesizers can produce high-utility, privacy-preserving datasets, providing a viable path for researchers to share and explore rich educational data safely.},

Fostering a cohesive and integrated road safety ecosystem ensures safer road environments that in turn promote safer behaviors.

Studies backed up with theoretical bases such as the theory of planned behavior help in measuring traffic safety cultures through beliefs identification, allowing better support for the design of these initiatives. However, traditional methods of carrying out such studies often rely on surveys and questionnaires which can be cumbersome. As a result, in this work, we investigate a more efficient alternative. We present a general framework to automate the extraction and monitoring of these beliefs from naturally occurring discussions in social media and news platforms. Using text mining and natural language processing, we attempted to discern insights, beliefs, and opinions regarding traffic safety culture. We present an exploratory comparative analysis that combines sentiment analysis, topic classification, and beliefs classification. Our best performing models achieved F1-scores of 0.80 for sentiment classification, 0.61 for topic classification, and 0.72 for belief classification. The results and interpretations obtained throughout this study can be leveraged in building behavior paradigms to predict and influence the way road users act by pruning traffic safety cultures through implementing the right ideologies.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging due to complex tumor boundaries and variations across MRI sequences. Although U-Net is a widely adopted architecture for medical image segmentation, its performance heavily depends on manually defined configurations, which are often suboptimal and labor-intensive. This study proposes GA-UNet, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-assisted framework that automatically optimizes U-Net architectures for multi-sequence brain tumor MRI segmentation. GA-UNet dynamically evolves encoder, bottleneck, and decoder configurations to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The framework is evaluated on two datasets: BraTS 2021, comprising four MRI sequences (T1, T1Gd, T2, FLAIR) for whole-tumor segmentation, and Figshare for multi-class tumor segmentation. GA-UNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9121 on BraTS 2021, outperforming U-Net AG-CHprep (0.9095) and nnU-Net (0.8900). On Figshare, it yields DSC values of 0.9369 (Meningioma), 0.9202 (Glioma), and 0.9226 (Pituitary), with corresponding Jaccard Index (JI) scores of 0.8821, 0.8531, and 0.8582. These results confirm GA-UNet’s robustness in accurately segmenting complex tumor regions across both whole-tumor and multi-class tasks. Additional evaluation using the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and statistical significance testing further validates its performance. Future work will explore 3D segmentation, attention mechanisms, and the integration of more advanced neural architecture search techniques.},

  abstract     = {The Input–Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is a crucial hardware component for enforcing access control for bus-master devices on the main memory. When properly configured by a hypervisor, it provides reliable protection against Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks from untrusted Virtual Machines (VMs) that control DMA-capable devices. Without an IOMMU, a malicious VM could instruct a DMA-capable device that it controls to access memory locations that the VM itself cannot access. This paper describes a novel DMA attack that allows bypassing the access control enforced by an IOMMU and may threaten some dynamic hypervisors. The DMA attack exploits the reallocation of DMA-capable devices when a VM is destroyed and a delay before the device effectively performs DMA. By leveraging a DMA-capable device under its control, this DMA attack potentially enables a malicious VM to breach hypervisor isolation and bypass the IOMMU-enforced access control. The wide applicability of the attack is impacted by constraints at the hypervisor, device, and platform levels. However, to support practicability, we present a proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of the attack on a hypervisor, using a common DMA-capable device in a realistic attack scenario. Finally, the applicability of the attack on other hypervisors and potential mitigation strategies are also discussed. This paper aims to raise awareness of a threat posed by this DMA attack and to encourage practitioners to evaluate and test their systems for such flaws.},

The proposed methodology includes automated segmentation of cycling routes based on slope variation, extraction of statistical and frequency features from physiological, accelerometric, and gyrometric signals, and their subsequent classification using signal processing and computational intelligence techniques. Analysis of 3,526 segmented intervals revealed significant correlations between heart rate variations and slope gradients, as well as estimations of motion symmetry coefficients relevant to biomechanical assessment. The classification accuracy reached 95.5% for motion and physiological features, and 85.6% for gyrometric data using the two-layer neural network model across different slope conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid systems combining wearable sensors and virtual environments for advanced motion analysis. This work underscores the applicability of general-purpose digital signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms in the multichannel analysis of physiological data, with applications in neurology, rehabilitation, and telemedicine.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces explainable deep occupancy, a robust framework empowered by explainable artificial intelligence for high-accuracy occupancy detection and occupant count estimation in smart buildings. Despite the complexity of indoor environments, the proposed framework demonstrates strong performance without requiring filtering or data balancing in the pre-processing phase, utilizing raw signal data from environmental sensors and WiFi access points. The deep learning architecture is based on recurrent neural network models, specifically gated recurrent unit and long short-term memory, to capture temporal dependencies. Gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional long short-term memory models were implemented, along with two hybrid models combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit and bidirectional long short-term memory. The first hybrid merges outputs of both models to enhance representational power. The second model integrates an attention mechanism to focus on critical temporal patterns. All models were evaluated on four datasets collected from three distinct buildings. The hybrid model with the attention mechanism achieved the best performance and was selected for integration into the final framework. To ensure interpretability, the results were analyzed using the Shapley Additive Explanations method, enabling identification of key hardware components and important sensor features contributing to prediction accuracy. Moreover, redundant components with minimal impact were identified, supporting hardware optimization and energy efficiency. The proposed framework achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.999703 for occupancy detection and 0.997917 for occupant count estimation, each obtained on different benchmark datasets. Obtained results demonstrate the framework’s strong generalization capability across diverse indoor environments.},

This paper proposes a dual deep neural network (dual-DNN) approach to accurately distinguish internal faults from simultaneous inrush currents, even under CT saturation. The proposed architecture consists of two stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE)-based networks: a compensation DNN (Com-DNN) and a discrimination DNN (Dis-DNN). The Com-DNN mitigates the adverse effects of CT saturation by learning to recognize and correct distortions in the current signals, while the Dis-DNN discriminates between inrush currents and internal faults. The dual-DNN approach was evaluated using a 23-kV power transformer under various scenarios, including simultaneous inrush and fault events. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers robust performance and stability under challenging conditions. A comparative analysis with a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) and three other existing methods confirms that the dual-DNN approach offers superior dependability and security.

  abstract     = {Lung cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques, especially those based on exhaled breath analysis, have recently garnered significant interest. This study explores a novel approach to lung cancer detection by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, and chloroform present in exhaled breath. Signal processing techniques, including Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), were employed to generate and analyze signals derived from VOC data. Features extracted from these transformed signals were subsequently classified using various machine learning and deep learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A comprehensive comparative evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of WT and WPT on model performance. Results indicate that WPT significantly enhances feature representation, improving classification accuracy across models. Among all evaluated models, the CNN outperformed others, achieving a maximum accuracy of 98.21% when applied to WPT-processed signals. This demonstrates the superior capability of deep learning models in handling complex VOC patterns and highlights their potential in clinical applications. The findings of this research affirm that integrating advanced signal processing techniques with deep learning can substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of non-invasive lung cancer diagnostics. The proposed method offers a promising, efficient, and patient-friendly alternative to conventional diagnostic procedures.},

However, existing event extraction methods encounter challenges in handling long texts and multi-scale semantic relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a joint event extraction model based on sliding window BERT and multi-head latent attention. This model simultaneously extracts event trigger words, subjects, objects, time and location through multi-scale feature fusion and latent variable modeling. Specifically, sliding window BERT is first employed to perform multi-scale encoding on the input text, thereby overcoming the length constraints of pre-trained models and capturing both local and global semantic features. Secondly, a multi-head latent attention mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the cross-head attention weights through latent variables, enabling the modeling of complex dependency relationships between trigger words and arguments. Finally, a joint decoding strategy is adopted, incorporating KL divergence to constrain the latent variable distribution, achieving end-to-end collaborative reasoning for trigger words and arguments. A series of multi-metric experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets such as ACE2005 and CEC 2.0. Experimental results demonstrate that this method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Dental implants are an effective solution for tooth loss, offering long-term success rates exceeding 95%. However, challenges such as surgical complications, improper implant position, and prosthetic inaccuracies persists, often due to operator inexperience or anatomical complexities. Previously, Static Computer-Assisted Implant Surgery (sCAIS) and Dynamic Navigation Systems (DNS) have shown improved precision in implant placement. However, sCAIS often incurs high costs and manufacturing delays, while DNS faces challenges like line-of-sight issues and magnetic interference. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering real-time orientation feedback with advantages such as low cost, portability, and no line-of-sight restrictions. Despite their potential, research on IMU-based guidance for dental implant placement is limited, with unresolved issues related to accuracy under drilling vibrations, device miniaturization, and clinical usability. This paper presents the design and validation of a compact IMU-based system that measures handpiece angulation in real-time, transmitting mesiodistal and buccolingual orientation data to a wireless clinician-worn watch. A thorough validation was conducted to measure both the static and dynamic accuracies, as well as the response time of the system when exposed to dental handpiece drill vibrations. The impact of the built-in filtering features of the IMU and various tuning parameters on performance was also assessed. The validation results indicate that the IMU-assisted implantology device is a cost-effective and adaptable solution for precise implant placement.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a user-centric routing and Adaptive Charging Strategy for EV Charging Station (EVCS) is proposed for reducing the Drive Range Anxiety (DRA) and simultaneously improves battery longevity. An IoT-based app is developed, which first collects user data to route and provide information to the user about various available EVCS with the aid of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The user can choose the charging modes that are Normal Charging (NC) or Adaptive Charging (ADC) and book the time slots as per the availability. In NC mode of charging, the EV battery immediately gets charged once plugged in, which will reduce the DRA. The ADC mode allows the user to choose minimum State of Charge (SoC) i.e., 50% or 70% upto which the battery will be charged after it is plugged in. Thereafter, the EV charging schedule is done according to the Need of Use (NoU) date and time, ensuring a better drive range in case of emergency, thus reducing the DRA. The ADC reduces Capacity Loss (Qloss) of the EV battery, thereby reducing Calendar Aging (CaA). This ensures that the life and health of the EV battery is improved. The proposed scheme for EVCS is validated in real time using the hardware setup that comprises of 120 V, 26 Ah Lead-Acid and 72 V, 30 Ah Lithium-Ion battery charging system that is controlled by WAVECT WCU300 controller interfaced with ESP-32 and Firebase Realtime Database. The comparison analysis shows that ADC reduces capacity loss by 2% with respect to NC. It also improves DRA with respect to Delayed Charging (DC) by 28.07%. Thus, ADC is the best solution for reducing calendar aging and enhancing battery longevity simultaneously.},

To overcome this limitation, the proposed method aims to mitigate CCS-MPCC’s parameter sensitivity while strengthening disturbance rejection in current control. The study first formulates the modeling and control strategies for CCS-MPCC, incorporating the effects of time delay on the dq-axis of the IPMSM. Additionally, the lumped parameter disturbances in the dq-axis are characterized. A detailed analysis of ANN-based SMO is then presented, demonstrating its ability to estimate the lumped parameter disturbances in dq-axis current control. To further enhance performance, an ANN is integrated into the traditional SMO to estimate the dq-axis lumped parameters disturbance, thereby reducing the required switching gains.

Aiming to address the above problems, a method of SINS/GNSS integrated navigation assisted by the tornado optimizer with Coriolis force (TOC) and nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX) is proposed. TOC is employed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of NARX to avoid the problem that a single network is easy to fall into local optimal solution and poor generalization. In the network training phase, the specific force, angular velocity, and the position and velocity increments of SINS are utilized as inputs, while the position and velocity increment of GNSS are used as outputs. When the GNSS signal is rejected, the trained network is utilized to predict the GNSS signal, thereby ensuring the normal operation of the navigation system. To validate the method, a series of simulation experiments were conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of this method is significantly improved compared to pure inertial navigation and unoptimized NARX models. This enhancement can support guided projectile integrated navigation during GNSS signal suppression.},

To improve data confidentiality and preserve control robustness under such conditions, the paper proposes a chaos-based encryption framework for securing bidirectional signal transmission in direct-current (DC) motor control systems. Two distinct Liu chaotic systems are employed—one for encrypting the PWM control signal and another for the motor speed feedback—operating in a master–slave configuration with different initial conditions. Synchronization is maintained via a sliding mode controller, while an adaptive disturbance observer (DOB) enhances robustness against external disturbances. Experimental validation on a physical setup with ESP32 microcontrollers and a separately excited DC motor demonstrates that, although the proposed scheme cannot prevent packet interception itself, it protects the payload from eavesdroppers and enables the system to maintain bounded synchronization errors and acceptable motor response even under MITM-induced delay and packet loss.},

In this study, the performance of the Logistic Regression model, one of the traditional machine learning techniques, was investigated in both default and optimized hyperparameter forms. The LSTM structure, which provides good results on sequential data, the BERT model, which has a high ability to represent contextual language, and the Soft-Masked BERT model, designed specifically for the task of spelling error detection, were examined. All models were evaluated on a balanced Turkish dataset containing at least one spelling error based on the sentences in the dataset, and comparisons were made using basic classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The findings show that the Logistic Regression model running with the default parameters failed to distinguish between classes with 0.366 accuracy and F1-score, while the best hyperparameter version of this model provided a significant improvement with 0.675 accuracy and F1-score. The LSTM model achieved partial success in learning sequential structure with 0.713 accuracy and 0.7 F1-score, outperforming the Logistic Regression model. The BERT model achieved 0.886 accuracy and 0.885 F1-score, outperforming both the Logistic Regression and LSTM models. The Soft-Masked BERT model achieved the highest success with 0.897 accuracy and F1-score.

  abstract     = {Failures of digital circuits can cause significant system downtime in industry sectors including manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, and healthcare. While testing methods are valuable to understand how failures can occur, they do not provide real-time early warnings needed to prevent catastrophic failures or forecast maintenance. This paper develops an adaptive online Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) solution for digital circuits that uses SPICE simulations and laboratory experiments to obtain circuit fault behaviors, while addressing the domain discrepancies between simulations and experimental data. The developed PHM solution achieves early fault detection by analyzing the transition behavior—the rising and falling edges—of circuit output voltage signals. Temporal, spectral, and temporal-spectral features are extracted from these transitions. Diagnosis includes fault type classification that localizes the degraded circuit components, and fault value prediction. The fault value is used in conjunction with component degradation models to make a prognosis of the circuit’s remaining useful life. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through implementation on a four transistor NAND gate. The developed adaptive PHM achieves 98.6% fault-type classification accuracy and 0.12 V RMSE in fault value prediction.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twins (DT), and robotics with Advanced Data Science Platforms (ADSP) is rapidly transforming industrial and research landscapes by enabling real-time data processing, intelligent decision-making, and enhanced automation. Over the past decades, with the growing demand for adaptable, expandable, and secure platforms, numerous groundbreaking studies have emerged in the field of ADSP for CPS, DT, and robotics. However, most existing research addresses isolated aspects of AI, CPS, DTs, or robotics, lacking a holistic view of how ADSP expands and optimizes these technologies. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and structured review of the existing methodologies, tools, and techniques at each step of the ADSP workflow, focusing on their applications in CPS, DT, and robotics. Firstly, this survey analyzes the data ingestion phase, focusing on raw data collection architecture, advanced data pre-processing techniques, and data lake integration, while identifying integration and scalability challenges. Secondly, the development methodologies and data analysis techniques within experimental workflows are explored by highlighting widely used tools and real-world case studies. Thirdly, a detailed overview of optimization techniques and deployment strategies is presented, including cloud, edge, and hybrid models, supported by practical deployment examples. Finally, the continuous learning mechanisms are investigated for adaptive system updates, challenges in real-time adaptation, and expanding model performance. Additionally, this survey focuses on evaluation metrics, benchmark studies, and performance comparisons to assess platform efficiency across various domains. This study also explores emerging challenges such as data quality & availability, platform expandability, model transparency, and security, offering insights into future research directions. To ensure the rigor and breadth, this survey is conducted on 319 high-quality studies, state-of-the-art methodologies, and platforms that are selected using the PRISMA methodology from over 600 reviewed publications. By presenting a structured overview of ADSPs, this work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals aiming to utilize data science for innovation in CPS, DT, and robotics.},

The state variables are branch currents in rectangular coordinates and an optimization problem is formulated to determine the system state. RMS measurements are considered to be obtained from smart meters, and a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is allocated at the main substation providing the angular reference. The network is modeled considering three phase unbalanced loads, radial topology and mutual impedances. The objective function, formulated based on the weighted least squares concept, is divided into three parts, aiming to minimize the quadratic difference between estimated values and their corresponding RMS values, phasor measurements and virtual measurements associated with the null power injection buses. Load pseudomeasurements are incorporated as inequality constraints, bounded by upper and lower limits derived from previously estimated values, assuming that the estimation process is performed at regular time intervals to track daily load profiles. This research article also presents a significant contribution for both technical and economic aspects discussion, including the costs associated with the equipments for practical implementation of the monitoring system. Computational simulations are conducted using a 33-bus test feeder and a real university distribution system to demonstrate the results of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models (FM) have proven effective in many speech applications except for speech enhancement (SE), where FM-based SE solutions still fall short with respect to specialized deep architectures. This work seeks to close this gap by systematically assessing and contrasting leading pre-trained FM architectures on a commonly used SE task, namely VoiceBank-Demand, and on the complex Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) challenge. Furthermore, three main ideas will be leveraged to boost FM-based SE models, namely: (i) Attention-based mask generation, (ii) consistency-preserving loss, and (iii) perceptual contrast stretching (PCS). Specifically, frame-level representations are effectively modeled using conformer layers, which leverage an attention mechanism. Inconsistency effects of signal reconstruction from the spectrogram are mitigated by incorporating consistency in the loss function. Finally, PCS is employed to improve the contrast of input and target features according to perceptual importance. All FM-based models generate an Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) from which the estimated clean speech is obtained. Experimental results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND task demonstrate that our approach helps close the gap between FM-based and SOTA SE solutions. When tested on the DNS challenge, the proposed FM-based SE solution compares favorably with previously proposed approaches on perceptual quality metrics, using only 10% of the available training material, though with a trade-off in signal fidelity (SI-SDR) when PCS preprocessing is applied.},

The system under study consists of a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users, with an IRS deployed to enhance propagation conditions. We develop an optimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming precoder at the BS by exploiting the angle-domain characteristics of the propagation paths to suppress inter-user interference. An optimization framework is formulated to configure the IRS phase shifts to maximize each user’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To overcome the non-convexity and complexity of this problem, we propose a quantization-based approximation approach, where the solution for continuous phase values is mapped to discrete quantized levels. This hybrid design ensures near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-aided beamforming and phase quantization algorithm achieves substantial gains in SINR, throughput, and spectral efficiency compared to random phase configurations. Furthermore, increasing the number of IRS elements effectively offsets the performance degradation caused by coarse phase quantization, confirming the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates advanced signal processing methodologies, with a focus on wavelet-based techniques, for the analysis of time-domain partial discharge (PD) signals captured using ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors. The raw signals are systematically processed through a sequence of operations including bandpass filtering, wavelet-based denoising, DC offset removal, and pulse extraction. Each processing stage is critically examined in both time and frequency domains to ensure signal integrity and noise suppression. Emphasis is placed on the optimization of wavelet parameters alongside extraction of key temporal and amplitude-based features such as time difference, charge difference, pulse height, rise time, and pulse width. To address the challenge of identifying the most discriminative features, this work integrates advanced feature ranking algorithms, namely, auto-encoder-based ranking and the ReliefF method. Their effectiveness is evaluated through criteria including training convergence, reconstruction error, and relevant quality metrics. The methodological novelty lies in the systematic fusion of optimized wavelet-based signal conditioning with robust feature selection frameworks, enabling a comprehensive assessment of feature importance and clarity. A total of 7 wavelet transformations with various decomposition levels, 17 wavelet families with various sub-categories and 2 non-wavelets are involved in this study. Comparative analysis between wavelet-based and conventional non-wavelet methods demonstrates the superior performance of the former in terms of feature extraction fidelity and signal enhancement. The findings establish that the proposed clarity-importance ranking framework significantly advances the accuracy and efficiency of UHF PD signal processing. This contributes to enhanced interpretability and reliability in PD diagnostics, thereby supporting more effective monitoring and maintenance of high-voltage insulation systems in real-world applications.},

We conducted online experiments using first-person shooter and racing game prototypes, assessing player experience via questionnaires, performance metrics, and qualitative feedback. Quantitative results revealed no significant overall improvement in immersion or performance. In fact, a statistically significant decrease in Cognitive Involvement (p = 0.03) was observed in the racing game. Qualitatively, while participants noted the high interaction cost, they also expressed interest in the concept for slower-paced genres. Our findings demonstrate that the benefits of a completely clean screen are largely offset by the costs of divided attention, indicating that this strategy is not a universal immersion enhancer. Future research should therefore focus on genre-specific applications and the development of interactive features to mitigate these attentional demands.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents the design, development, and proof of concept of an intelligent decision support system for the interpretation of lung auscultation. The proposed system generates a multimodal representation that integrates acoustic data from auscultation — transformed into a time-frequency representation using the Continuous Wavelet Transform with the Generalized Morse Wavelet family— with clinical information, including body mass index and the presence of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and emphysema. The resulting image is processed by two independent convolutional neural networks based on the SqueezeNet architecture, which estimate the likelihood of pathological lung sounds in the left and right lungs separately. This approach enables precise localization of abnormalities and supports a more objective assessment of auscultation findings. Evaluation on a reserved test set yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.77 for both classifiers. Beyond its immediate diagnostic utility, this study introduces a novel multimodal data-fusion framework that combines clinical and acoustic information for automated lung sound interpretation. Despite the promising results, it should be noted that the system is still in a conceptual phase of development, so further validation will be needed before its implementation in clinical practice.},

However, their increasing adoption has brought to light numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities, some of which remain insufficiently studied. This paper aims to identify and examine underexplored vulnerabilities affecting LLMs, with particular attention to threats that remain underrepresented in current literature. The selection of vulnerabilities is guided by a systematic comparison of four major surveys, prioritizing in-depth analysis for vulnerabilities absent in at least three of these works. The methodological approach combines a targeted literature search across major academic databases with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on relevance, novelty, and the selection of peer-reviewed journal and conference publications.The survey introduces a taxonomy based on the LLM lifecycle (i.e., training, inference, and deployment) through which 17 vulnerabilities are categorized and discussed. Eight emerging threats (e.g., model collapse, gradient leakage, denial-of-service, and dependency risks) receive comprehensive analysis, reflecting their growing relevance and limited prior exploration. The result is a structured taxonomy and in-depth analysis designed to guide both academic investigations and practical efforts toward the secure deployment of LLMs in real-world environments. In addition to mapping the current threat landscape, this survey highlights open challenges and outlines key directions for future research.},

Subsequently, highly discriminative intrinsic mode function components are selected for feature extraction, and the CPO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN-SVM model, thereby improving deep feature representation and fault classification performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the dual-optimizer strategy, demonstrating superior performance in terms of convergence speed, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency, achieving a fault diagnosis accuracy of 98.0%, which is 2.0%–6.0% higher than existing hybrid models. Furthermore, computational complexity analysis confirms the framework’s real-time capability, aligning well with the stringent requirements of high voltage circuit breaker fault diagnosis.},

The proposed system integrates multiple machine learning models—including Random Forest, Neural Network, XGBoost, and others—to detect cyber threats effectively. Binary classification achieved 100% accuracy, while multi-class attack identification reached 99.99% accuracy across all tested models. A hybrid cryptographic scheme combining AES in EAX mode and RSA-OAEP was employed to secure Modbus traffic, increasing entropy from 4.1 to 7.8 bits and providing resistance against entropy-based attacks. Protocol hardening techniques, such as field-level encryption, SHA-256-based integrity checks, and device-role authorization, collectively reduced the overall attack frequency by over 80%. To evaluate hardware-level deployment, the binary classification model was implemented on a Coral Dev Board, achieving a real-time detection latency of 0.38 seconds for both training and testing, thereby demonstrating suitability for edge-based ICS integration. Threat hunting capabilities were enhanced using K-Means clustering and Isolation Forest, enabling the identification of previously unknown attack patterns. This framework delivers a real-time, cryptographically secure, and lightweight defense mechanism against advanced cyber threats in ICS environments.

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of implied volatility surfaces is crucial for option pricing and risk management in financial markets. Traditional parametric approaches, such as the Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) model, often suffer from rigid functional forms that inadequately capture the complex nonlinear patterns observed in real market data, particularly in the tail regions of volatility smiles. This paper introduces a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework specifically designed to learn and reconstruct implied volatility surfaces directly from historical option market prices. Our approach leverages the adversarial training mechanism to generate smooth, market-consistent volatility surfaces that overcome the limitations of conventional parametric models. The proposed GAN architecture incorporates domain-specific constraints and regularization techniques to ensure the generated surfaces satisfy fundamental no-arbitrage conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation using real-world AAPL options data spanning 2016-2020, we demonstrate that our GAN-based approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in reducing pricing errors under the Black-Scholes framework. Specifically, our method achieves a 23.7% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for out-of-the-money options and a 31.4% improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the baseline SVI model. The results indicate particularly substantial improvements in pricing accuracy for deep out-of-the-money options, where traditional models typically exhibit the largest deviations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior stability across different market regimes and provides enhanced generalization capabilities for options with varying maturities and moneyness levels. The proposed methodology offers significant practical implications for derivatives trading, risk management, and model validation in quantitative finance.},

Factors such as antenna placement, signal polarization, tunnel geometry (straight or curved), and dynamic obstructions like pedestrians or vehicles further complicate propagation dynamics. The main goal of this work is to model and validate the impact of tunnel environments on wireless signal propagation using a versatile ray-tracing approach. To address these issues, a robust and adaptive Ray tracing model is developed and validated through extensive real-world experiments. The study evaluates the root mean square delay spread, a key metric for assessing communication link performance and determining the maximum reliable data rate. Results show that tunnel geometry significantly influences optimal polarization, with horizontal polarization recommended for tall, narrow tunnels. Pedestrian obstructions increase delay spread by approximately 50% compared to unobstructed conditions. Additionally, sharp 90-degree corners yield delay spread values four times higher than chamfered corners, accompanied by significant frequency-selective fading. These experimentally validated findings provide essential insights into wireless signal behavior in confined spaces, supporting the development of more reliable tunnel communication systems, with direct relevance to future 6G and IoT applications.},

In DLR approaches, line capacity or ampacity is calculated using thermoelectric conductor models, which are highly sensitive to the effect of wind, especially at low wind speeds, which have the strongest effect on conductor temperature reduction. Due to its powerful cooling effect, wind speed plays an important role in determining conductor temperature. In this paper, experimental tests are conducted to analyze the thermal behavior of four transmission line conductors, i.e., two aluminum alloy conductors (AAAC), one aluminum conductor steel-reinforced conductor (ACSR), and one high-temperature, low-sag conductor (HTLS). The tests were performed in a laboratory environment under controlled temperature and wind conditions. International standards such as IEEE, Cigré and IEC propose formulations for both natural and forced convection, which are evaluated and compared in this paper using experimental laboratory data. The results show that while the proposed natural convection formulations found in the standards give very similar results, forced convection formulations can lead to significant differences in conductor temperature and ampacity prediction. Since forced convection plays an important role in determining the conductor temperature, the results presented in this paper are useful to better understand the effects of forced convection and to avoid miscalculations.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain demand forecasting faces unprecedented challenges due to the complex interplay of multiple information sources, including market dynamics reflected in textual data, historical consumption patterns, and macroeconomic indicators captured through satellite imagery. Traditional forecasting methods primarily rely on historical time series data, failing to leverage the rich contextual information available from heterogeneous data modalities. This paper proposes a novel Causal-Aware Multimodal Transformer (CAMT) framework that systematically integrates textual data from news and social media, time series of historical demand, and satellite imagery reflecting economic activities for enhanced demand forecasting accuracy. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a cross-modal attention mechanism that enables effective fusion of text-temporal-visual representations through learnable inter-modal relationships, (2) a causal discovery-based feature importance evaluation method that identifies genuine causal relationships between different modalities and demand patterns while mitigating spurious correlations, and (3) a hierarchical multi-scale prediction framework that provides coherent forecasts across product, category, and regional levels. The framework is built upon a Vision-Language Transformer architecture with specialized encoders for each modality and a unified decoder for demand prediction. Extensive experiments on the M5 Forecasting Competition dataset, augmented with news articles, social media posts, and corresponding satellite imagery, demonstrate that CAMT achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 12.3% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 15.7% improvement in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to the best performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component, while causal analysis reveals that satellite-derived economic indicators contribute most significantly to long-term forecasting accuracy, whereas textual sentiment shows stronger predictive power for short-term demand fluctuations. The proposed framework offers practical implications for supply chain management by enabling more accurate demand forecasting that considers diverse external factors, ultimately supporting better inventory management and operational planning decisions.},

The problem becomes even more complex due to real-world application limitations, such as having a single camera view and pattern plane. In this work, the problem of specular surface reconstruction from a single viewpoint is formulated as an optimization process that satisfies both geometrical and optical constraints. To this end, a patch-wise approach is developed to complete the entire depth map. For each patch, the optimization process aims to minimize the angle between geometric normals and normals derived from reflections. This process is propagated across the entire depth map to reconstruct the whole surface. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to noise in reflection point correspondences. Since there is no publicly-available dataset for this task, this paper develops a pipeline for generating synthetic data.},

This study integrated longitudinal data from 4,142 singleton pregnancies (including 227 HDP cases) monitored throughout pregnancy at a Shanghai hospital (2016–2024). We constructed a neighborhood-level, multi-source environmental exposure database (temperature/humidity/BE) and compared the performance of multiple models (Discrete-Time Logistic Regression (DTLR), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for HDP risk. We further investigated the association mechanisms between different exposure types and HDP. Key findings include: 1. The XGBoost model achieved the optimal predictive performance (Area Under the Curve, AUC=0.847), outperforming a baseline model that neglected heat-humidity synergy and time-weighting by ΔAUC=0.05 (p=0.013); 2. Each 0.1-unit increase in green view index (GVI) significantly reduced HDP risk by 26% (Odds Ratio, OR=0.74, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.62–0.89), while the street canyon effect (Sky View Factor, SVF >0.6) amplified the risk from equivalent heat exposure by 37%; 3. Cumulative exposure to just 3 days of moderate heat (Moderate Heat Days Lag 4, MHDL4) during the first trimester (<12 weeks) doubled HDP risk (OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.48–2.16), with extreme heat events (Extreme Heat Days Lag 4, EHDL4) exhibiting more pronounced lagged effects (4-day lag OR=2.03). This study elucidates the potential impacts of environmental factors on maternal health, providing a crucial reference for pregnancy health protection and policy formulation amid increasing extreme climate events.

However, the presence of outliers across different data types such as visual, textual, and numerical poses a major challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Outlier Optimizer (MOO), a unified framework designed to detect and filter outliers from heterogeneous data modalities within video files. MOO decomposes each video into still images, text, and numeric sequences, allowing specialized algorithms to handle each modality: Nonlocal Means (NLM) for removing Gaussian noise in image frames and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for detecting contextual outliers in textual and numerical data. These filtered components are then recombined into a cleaned, optimized video. The system is trained and evaluated using synthetically generated datasets to simulate real-world noise while ensuring scalability and control. Performance is assessed using Jaccard Similarity Score (JSS) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), with results demonstrating consistent improvements even under high contamination levels (up to 50%), achieving SSIM scores above 0.77 across three domains: medical imaging, remote sensing, and zoomed video data. These results highlight MOO’s potential as an effective and adaptable tool for enhancing the integrity of multimodal video data in complex, real-world environments.},

As a consequence, novel robotic systems are integrated within the current digital industrial environments ensuring real-time adaptation to production changes and safe operation with humans and machines. Collaborative robots (cobots) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are designed to follow these principles enhancing the current digital industrial revolution. However, while AMRs are subjected to navigation errors, cobots incur in positioning errors due to the stepper motors operation, resulting in a combined interaction error that do not allow a direct accurate operation between these robots. The addressing of this challenge requires the definition of a robust integration framework between these robots that enables the compensation for the interaction errors occurring during their joint operation. To achieve this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel Fictitious Points Compensation Methodology (FPCM) based on contacts on the AMR structure and an appropriate error characterization that compensates the interaction errors, proving that these errors are systematic. Practically, we make use of fictitious points that define the final position of the cobot end-effector to minimize the final interaction error. The validity of the proposal is verified through two practical cases showing angular errors up to 0.04°, and placement errors up to 0.13 mm, which validates both the proposal and the error characterization. Thus, our method efficiently addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous robotic systems within the current industrial paradigm.},

This article investigates a U-IRS-assisted data collection system in WSNs that employs the hover priority scheme. Given the energy constraints of UAV, the combined energy consumption from UAV moving/hovering and IRS reflecting elements configuration circuitry poses significant challenges to improving the system’s energy efficiency (EE). To address this challenge, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem under the constraints of UAV and SN power budgets to make a tradeoff between EE and spectral efficiency. Due to the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we divide the main problem into three subproblems: user association, the number of reflecting elements, and UAV trajectory optimization. An alternating optimization algorithm integrating the genetic algorithm, the CJ-BS-based cyclic iteration algorithm, Dinkelbach’s algorithm, and the successive convex approximation method is proposed to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the UAV hovering directly above each SN scheme.},

Therefore, more in-depth and practical studies on communication in control systems are needed. Our study aims to explore the practical impacts of communication networks on control systems. We provide a general overhead analysis for the structure of NCSs and design an express delivery-based cost chart, referred to as an E-Chart, for the control message sizes. We found an effect in the express delivery service known as the “Rice Grain Effect,” defined as the cost of delivering a single rice grain is the same as the cost of delivering two rice grains. We apply the effect to the control overhead analysis and the E-Chart. We present the results of the E-Chart and the overhead under different message sizes and compression ratios; furthermore, we define a new metric to reflect the stability of the formation control and conduct simulations to study the impacts of message size and error on NCSs. In particular, formation control is affected by both bit error rate and message size, and the system exhibits high sensitivity to variations in bit error rate.},

  abstract     = {The variable nature of sustainable energy sources, coupled with unpredictable fluctuations in load, significantly impacts microgrid planning and operation. This creates an urgent need for storage systems that possess both high energy and power handling capacities to enhance the reliability and efficiency of microgrids. Hybridizing fuel cells (FCs) and battery storage system offers a promising solution by combining the advantages of both technologies. To this end, this article introduces an innovative model designed to determine the optimal sizing and management of a hybrid system comprising FCs and lithium batteries for islanded microgrid applications. The model considers the critical tradeoffs between the high-power density and efficiency of lithium batteries and the extended lifespan and energy density of FCs. Furthermore, it incorporates factors such as investment and operational expenses, the state-of-health of the FC, battery degradation costs, and the dynamic efficiency of the FC. To reduce computational burden, all constraints are modeled as linear, and mixed integer linear programming, suitable for linear models, is employed for the problem formulation. Simulation results and comparative analyses confirm the model’s effectiveness, demonstrating a reduction in annual microgrid cost by up to 24.45% while exhibiting a notable 8% reduction in required storage compared to using only individual lithium battery storage.},

However, storage scalability is a bottleneck due to the explosive growth of blockchain data, posing a challenge for devices with limited computing and storage resources, such as IoT devices, to maintain a complete copy of the blockchain data. In this article, we propose a scalable storage framework for IoT-based blockchain that utilizes collaborative storage to lighten the storage burden on blockchain nodes. Nodes on the blockchain are grouped, and the nodes in each group pool their resources to maintain a complete copy of blockchain data. We formulate the block storage problem based on node groups to minimize communication cost, storage cost, and query cost while considering node capacity and block redundancy. We break down the problem into two separate subproblems: node group creation and block allocation. The former involves dividing blockchain nodes into groups, while the latter involves allocating blocks to nodes within a group. We demonstrate the NP-hardness of the subproblems and propose heuristic algorithms. We conducted thorough experiments using both synthetic data and the blockchain prototype system. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed framework.},

While characteristics such as performance, power, and efficiency are critical, developer velocity, which dictates how quickly a new workload can be deployed on an accelerator, is equally important. The accelerator architecture and properties it exposes to the higher-level programming model play a key role in determining the programming model and economic viability of the accelerators. We compare two classes of AI/ML accelerator architectures: an efficient loosely coupled accelerator already implemented in silicon and a tightly coupled accelerator with a traditional and user-friendly programming model. Our comparison shows that the performance of the design depends on the amount of hardware resources and not on how they are integrated, concluding that it is possible to architect accelerators in a much simpler and more compiler-friendly manner, while still maintaining the benefits of offload computing.},

To that end, we present the world’s first robotic circulating nurse (RCN), a novel mobile robotic assistance system, which aims to support clinicians during surgical interventions by autonomously executing tasks within nonsterile areas of the operating room (OR) environment. A core use case of the RCN is the collection, opening, and handing over of sterilely packaged surgical materials, for which we describe our approach to robotic design and behavior implementation. Technical evaluation tests show that our RCN prototype reliably handles the end-to-end workflow for providing requested materials to the surgical team. The practical feasibility and user acceptance of the approach were confirmed during a user study conducted with the OR nursing team at a German university hospital. As a main focus of this article, the hygienic robotic handover of surgical materials was evaluated, yielding an overall success rate of 98.71%. While the execution speed is still in need of improvement, our RCN received highly favorable ratings with regard to relevance, usability, reliability, and hygiene. This underlines the high potential of the RCN concept for addressing the staff shortage problem and for upholding today’s high standard of surgical patient care.},

To achieve this, it is shown that any quadratically stable/dissipative DT-LPV-IO model can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball. The unit ball is reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in a fully unconstrained parameterization. These results immediately apply to linear time-varying IO models. In the linear time-invariant case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable/dissipative DT transfer functions is obtained. The unconstrained parametrization enables, among others, the use of neural network coefficient functions in LPV system identification while guaranteeing stability and dissipativity.},

The underpinning of the definition lies in the matrix segmental phase which, as its name implies, is graphically based on the smallest circular segment covering the matrix normalized numerical range in the unit disk. The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.},

  abstract     = {A privacy-preserving incentive mechanism to maximize the weighted social welfare for pseudo-gradient-based noncooperative dynamical systems is developed. Sensitive information that could reveal the payoff functions is referred to as the privacy of agents. In the proposed approach, at least half of the agents (named as nonessential agents) can provide some nonsensitive information in addition to their state values, enabling the system manager to influence agents' dynamical decisions by imposing taxes or offering subsidies with a sustainable budget constraint. To protect the privacy of all agents, our approach shifts the stationary points of the nonessential agents and hence indirectly moves the Nash equilibrium of the entire system. By constructing the additional nonsensitive information from nonessential agents as the time-wise information of stationary-point mappings related to certain secret matrices, sufficient conditions are derived where the Nash equilibrium is shifted towards the target state achieving Pareto efficiency under the incentive mechanism. We also provide some stability conditions to ensure that agents' state converges to the target state under a sustainable budget for the given initial state. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficacy of our results.},

The approach uses data-driven predictors based on an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma and requires only a single persistently exciting input-output data trajectory. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on availability of exact disturbance data. Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the distributed aggregative optimization challenge in uncertain multiple Euler- Lagrange (EL) systems, where each EL agent's local objective function depends on its own position and the aggregation of all EL agents' positions. The goal is to control all EL agents to reach their optimal positions as defined by the aggregative optimization problem. Two distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are proposed for uncertain EL systems, which are based on distinct optimization-control strategies, namely the open-loop optimization-control strategy and the closed-loop optimization-control strategy. To address the model uncertainty in EL systems, an auxiliary second-order system is introduced, integrating with adaptive compensation and tracking techniques to mitigate the uncertainty. Given the unique structure of the aggregative optimization problem, two distributed estimation protocols are developed for handling the aggregation terms in the optimization problem. Specifically, in the open-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient is derived from the position information of the auxiliary system; whereas, in the closed-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient relies on the real-time position of the EL system. The convergence of both algorithms is rigorously proved. Unlike existing studies that mainly concentrate on distributed optimization algorithms based on either open-loop or closed-loop strategies, this paper is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of open-loop and closed-loop optimization-control strategies, with a special emphasis on the robustness of the closed-loop strategy in counteracting external disturbances and variations. Finally, the proposed distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are applied to the optimal localization problem of networked marine vehicles with parameter uncertainties. Comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

Here, a heavy-tailed noise $\xi$ does not necessarily adhere to the bounded variance assumption, i.e., $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^{2}]\leq \nu ^{2}$ for some positive constant $\nu$. Instead, it satisfies a more general condition $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^\delta ]\leq \nu ^\delta$ for some $1&lt; \delta \leq 2$. The commonly-used bounded variance assumption is a special case of the considered noise assumption. While several distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed for scenarios involving heavy-tailed noise, these algorithms need a centralized server in the network which collects the information of all clients. Different from these algorithms, this paper considers a scenario where there is no centralized server and the agents can only exchange information with neighbors within a communication graph. A distributed method combining gradient clipping and distributed stochastic gradient projection is proposed. It is proven that when the gradient descent step-size and the gradient clipping step-size meet certain conditions, the state of each agent converges to an optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem with probability 1. The simulation results validate the algorithm.},

While exact moment matching with finite data is impractical in this scenario, we introduce the concepts of weak moment matching and moment matching almost everywhere onto the $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-space. Additionally, we address scenarios in which the dataset contains noisy measurements of outputs that are not yet in a steady-state, which typically biases the estimation due to the effect of the output transients. We further prove that estimating over a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space can ensure weak moment matching asymptotically and, with additional assumptions, also moment matching almost everywhere despite these transients. Finally, we provide a probabilistic bound that guarantees weak moment matching for an arbitrarily finite amount of data.},

  abstract     = {The optimal $H_{\infty }$ control problem over an infinite time horizon, which incorporates a performance functional with a discount factor $e^{-\alpha t}$ ($\alpha &gt; 0$), is important in various fields. Solving this problem is equivalent to addressing a discounted Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation. In this paper, we first establish a precise estimate for the discount factor $\alpha$ that guarantees the existence of a nonnegative stabilizing solution to the discounted HJI equation. This stabilizing solution corresponds to the stable manifold of the characteristic system associated with the discounted HJI equation, which is a contact Hamiltonian system due to the discount factor. Secondly, we demonstrate that a natural approximation of the optimal controller yields a closed-loop system whose $L_{2}$-gain is arbitrarily close to that of the original system. Thirdly, based on these theoretical results, we propose a deep learning algorithm to compute an approximate optimal controller by utilizing the stable manifold of the contact Hamiltonian system derived from the HJI equation. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we give two examples: $H_{\infty }$ control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and $H_{\infty }$ control of the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation.},

This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.},

  abstract     = {Some recent papers have extended the concept of finite-time stability (FTS) to the context of 2D linear systems, where it has been referred to as finite-region stability (FRS). FRS methodologies make even more sense than the classical FTS approach developed for 1D-systems, since, typically, at least one of the state variables of 2D-systems is a space coordinate, rather than a time variable. Since space coordinates clearly belong to finite intervals, FRS techniques are much more effective than the classical Lyapunov approach, which looks to the asymptotic behavior of the system over an infinite interval. To this regard, the novel contribution of this paper goes in several directions. First, we provide a novel sufficient condition for the FRS of linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time 2D-systems, which turns out to be less conservative than those provided in the existing literature. Then, an interesting application of FRS to the context of iterative learning control (ILC) is investigated, by exploiting the previously developed theory. In particular, a new procedure is proposed so that the tracking errors of the ILC law converges within the desired bound in a finite number of iterations. Finally, a sufficient condition to solve the finite-region stabilization problem is proposed. All the results provided in the paper lead to optimization problems constrained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that can be solved via widely available software. Numerical examples illustrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

In current formation control studies, the control objectives typically focus on achieving desired local geometric properties, such as inter-agent distances, bearings, or relative positions. In contrast, our dispersion formation control approach enables agents to directly regulate the dispersion of their spatial distribution, a global variable associated with a covariance matrix. Specifically, we introduce the notion of covariance similarity to define the target spatial dispersion of agents. Building on this framework, we propose two control strategies: a centralized approach to illustrate the key ideas, and a distributed approach that enables agents to control the global dispersion but using only local information. Our stability analysis demonstrates that both strategies ensure exponential convergence of the agents' distribution to the desired dispersion. Notably, controlling a global variable rather than multiple local ones enhances the resiliency of the system, particularly against malfunctioning agents. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed dispersion formation control.},

Specifically, we construct a distributed projection optimization algorithm with an expanding constraint set in the decision-making layer, while proposing a reference-tracking safety controller to ensure that each agent's output remains within a shrinking safety set in the control layer. We also establish the convergence and safety analysis of the closed-loop system using the small-gain theorem and time-varying control barrier function (CBF) theory, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the cooperative robust parallel operation problem of a general linear uncertain system driven by multiple actuators. Compared with the existing work, the uncertainties for both the controlled system and the actuator systems, as well as the disturbances for actuator systems, are all taken into consideration. To solve the problem, we develop a dynamic output feedback controller based on the internal model principle. First, a general framework for solving the cooperative robust parallel operation problem is established. By establishing some technical lemmas, we reveal the relationship between the system input sharing of actuators and the robust output regulation property. Then, for different network conditions, we propose the gain matrix design methods in terms of the network connectivity property and the system matrix of the dynamic controller. It guarantees the solvability of the regulator equations and the stability property of the system matrix associated with the closed-loop system. Resorting to the internal model principle, we show that the cooperative robust parallel operation problem can be solved in spite of system uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed internal model approach is verified by its application to a shaft driven control with fifteen electric actuator motors.},

First, within the framework of the periodic delayed feedback approach, two novel super-twisting algorithms are proposed, whose settling times are bounded by a constant independent of the initial conditions and can be arbitrarily prescribed. Next, for a class of high-order uncertain nonlinear systems, a novel disturbance observer and a prescribed-time continuous sliding mode control law are designed based on the first super-twisting algorithm. Furthermore, for a class of perturbed double integrator systems, a novel state observer and a prescribed-time continuous sliding mode control law by output feedback are designed based on the second super-twisting algorithm. Unlike the widely used time-varying high-gain feedback approach in the literature, the control laws designed in this paper ensure that the system output converges to zero with the settling time being exactly equal to the prescribed time, even in the presence of both matched and mismatched disturbances, while mitigating sensitivity to measurement noise and avoiding the singularity issues caused by infinite gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through simulations.},

Then, some analytical expressions of optimal tracking and regulation performance are derived using frequency-domain analysis and two-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) control techniques. The results demonstrate that the tracking and regulation performance of NCSs is influenced by the locations and directions of the NMPZs and UPs of the plant, network-induced time delays, quantization dead zones, and quantization densities.

The existing mean-subsequence-reduced-based algorithms rely on dimension-wise ordering to resist Byzantine attacks, leading to poor scalability in high-dimensional systems. To overcome this issue, the signum operator and absolute value function are employed to decouple the high-dimensional attack characteristics, based on which a norm-based max-discard mechanism (NMDM) is proposed to isolate location-varying Byzantine attacks. Building upon this foundation, a resilient distributed state estimation algorithm integrated with NMDM is developed to achieve consensus estimation of high-dimensional vectors, irrelevant to the switching frequency of attack locations.

We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off.

The reachability of tracking errors is then analyzed using set propagation techniques. The convergence of the reachable sets to a bounded invariant set is proved. A parameterized optimal trajectory is obtained by solving a linear quadratic minimal control problem based on the Brunovsky canonical form with interior-point constraints. The parameters are then optimized through a bilevel program, where the inner program is used to validate the dynamic reachability constraints. By leveraging the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, the bilevel program is transformed into a mathematical program with complementarity constraints, which is solved by a smoothing method.

  abstract     = {Understanding and expressing emotions is subjective, leading to varying levels of ambiguity in how emotions are perceived. Humans naturally handle this ambiguity, and it's crucial for machines to do the same for natural human-machine interaction. Efforts are being made to develop emotion recognition systems that can handle ambiguity by modelling emotions as distributions of arousal/valence labels. However, existing approaches often assume that an underlying distribution can be inferred from ground truth ratings. Yet, the underlying distribution is never observed and the inferred distribution from the ratings can accurately represent the true distribution only when enough raters are involved. Our study investigates how the number of raters impacts the uncertainty in inferring distributions from ground truth ratings in the context of modelling emotion ambiguity. We then explore how many raters may be sufficient to effectively approximate the ambiguity present in the emotion annotations. Using the Belief Mismatch Coefficient (BMC) for analysis, we compare distributions to different numbers of ground truth ratings leading to quantitative and interpretable inferences. Experimental analysis was conducted using both simulated ratings and the real emotion (both arousal and valence) ratings collected from MSP-Conversation dataset. Our results suggest that using 5 raters may be sufficient to approximate a stable distribution representing the underlying emotional ambiguity when time continuous emotion ratings are captured and annotated from speech. Our study provides insights and practical advice for collecting emotion labels. Additionally, the analyses methods presented in this paper are expected to be relevant in any field of study dealing with labelling of subjective quantities that can vary from person to person.},

  abstract     = {We investigate mental stress and relaxation patterns in professionals occupying leadership roles in emergency care and special police units. A key finding is that on days that involve critical missions, these individuals experience negative mental stress (i.e., distress) that escalates as the day unfolds. In contrast, on non-leadership workdays, mental distress remains relatively stable, while on non-workdays, participants exhibit positive mental stress (i.e., eustress) that subsides over time, facilitating relaxation. These findings stem from a four-day naturalistic study of $n=24$ professionals, during which we collected physiological, mobility, and psychometric data. Using participant debriefings and sensor-based validation triggers (e.g., GPS, cadence), we labeled activities in 5-minute intervals and focused our analysis on sedentary periods. We defined stress during these periods as a normalized heart rate that exceeds two standard deviations above a personalized baseline, thus isolating mental stress uncontaminated by physical exertion. A logistic regression model based on this stress labeling method yielded results largely consistent with those obtained from Kubios' SNS Index, reinforcing its validity. In cases of disagreement, our method aligned better with participant reports and established literature, highlighting advantages in interpretability and specificity. Overall, our work makes three contributions: (a) to affective science, by quantifying the mentally stressful nature of leadership in high-stakes environments; (b) to affective computing, by proposing a wearable compatible method for estimating mental stress during sedentary activity in the wild; (c) to data science, by introducing a well-annotated, multimodal dataset suitable for machine learning benchmarking in stress detection.},

  abstract     = {Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network (MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet—MPFNet-P and MPFNet-C—corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of 0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Mac0504/MPFNet.},

By integrating coarse-grained relationship modeling with fine-grained key individual enhancement and leveraging global scene information, our method effectively refines discriminative feature generation while minimizing irrelevant interference. We introduce a Multi-branch Interaction Module (MIM) to dynamically fuse features from both the global scene and local individual branches using a localized mask integration strategy.

  abstract     = {Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing behavioral patterns with a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the existing methods.

When people are engaged in a social task, impressions of their partner's emotions differ from the impressions of detached bystanders. In this paper, we explore how facial expressions, contexts and perspective (1st, 2nd-, and 3rd-person) interact to determine judgments of emotion. We explore this using automatic facial expression analysis of natural expressions produced in the context of a social task (the prisoner's dilemma). Our findings suggest that expression and context combine to determine judgments, but the way they combine differs depending on perspective. We discuss the implication of these findings for automatic emotion recognition methods and the inferences such methods can support.},

  abstract     = {Emotional stress significantly impacts mental and physical health, motivating the need for computational methods that can model subtle affective states. This study introduces a novel multimodal multitask architecture for the simultaneous regression of arousal and valence, two key emotional dimensions correlated with emotional stress. Utilizing the ULM-TSST dataset, the proposed model integrates video, audio, text, and physiological data through a combination of LSTM and Transformer Encoder networks, employing class tokens for task-specific representations. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an average Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 60% for valence and 61% for arousal, outperforming existing approaches by a 4% CCC margin. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each modality, confirming that the best performance is achieved only when all modalities are included. Additionally, comparative analysis between the multitask and single-task versions of the architecture confirms that the multitask approach outperforms single-task models in both arousal and valence prediction. This improvement underscores the benefits of shared representations and joint learning of related affective dimensions within a unified framework.

To address that, this study tests the automatic recognition of boredom induced during a video lecture using a multimodal recognition system relying on physiological signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and eye gaze data were recorded from 84 healthy adults (mean age = 26.90 ± 5.29) as they watched both non-boring and boring educational videos to control and induce boredom. Signal features were extracted from the physiological data and validated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests prior to evaluating their utility for boredom recognition with three separate machine-learning classification techniques, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), with leave-one-out cross-validation. Both unimodal and multimodal recognition systems were assessed by evaluating model performance using each physiological signal separately or in combination (using decision fusion). Multimodal recognition was found to enhance model performance when compared to any single modality, with the highest average boredom recognition accuracy of 88.56% ± 0.82% recorded for EEG + eye gaze modal fusion with RF.},

Primary challenges in BAM arise from the rich presence of specialized terms and a diverse range of entities. These entities often occur within ACs and co-occur in ARs, providing valuable cues for identifying ACs and ARs. Most of the existing approaches do not leverage these cues. This paper presents Ent-BAM, a BAM framework that incorporates entity (co-)occurrence information in a text-to-text generation paradigm. Plain text serves as the input, and the output is formatted in Augmented Natural Language (ANL). First, we employ a prompt-based strategy using a large language model (LLM) to extract (co-)occurred entities from the standard BAM dataset. Then, we construct the ANL output by embedding AC and AR labels, along with those extracted entities, within a single sequence. Ent-BAM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods by an average task margin of up to 4.86% Micro F1 Score, highlighting the strong potential of our approach.},

The existing defense mechanisms often rely on single-view, single-task models that utilize a single feature set to perform one specific task. However, modern IoT systems are multifaceted, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained, posing considerable challenges for developing unified and scalable defense solutions. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid model called M2VT that integrates Multi-View Learning (MVL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for effective cyber-attack defense. The model simultaneously processes three distinct subsets of relevant features (views) to perform three interrelated tasks: attack detection, attack category classification, and attack type classification. The model leverages AutoEncoder (AE) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract task-specific spatial and temporal features, enhancing both efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The M2VT model is evaluated using four publicly available IoT benchmark datasets and one testbed dataset. Across all tasks and datasets, the model achieves over 96% accuracy, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. The parallel execution of MVL and MTL, combined with taskspecific feature subsets, significantly boosts performance. The implementation of M2VT is publicly available in our code repository 1.},

  abstract     = {Drawing inspiration from the outstanding learning capability of our human brains, Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) emerges as a novel computing paradigm, and it leverages high-dimensional vector representation and operations for brain-like lightweight Machine Learning (ML). Practical deployments of HDC have significantly enhanced the learning efficiency compared to current deep ML methods on a broad spectrum of applications. However, boosting the data efficiency of HDC classifiers in supervised learning remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce Hyperdimensional Efficient Active Learning (HEAL), a novel Active Learning (AL) framework tailored for HDC classification. HEAL proactively annotates unlabeled data points via uncertainty and diversity-guided acquisition, leading to a more efficient dataset annotation and lowering labor costs. Unlike conventional AL methods that only support classifiers built upon deep neural networks (DNN), HEAL operates without the need for gradient or probabilistic computations. This allows it to be effortlessly integrated with any existing HDC classifier architecture. The key design of HEAL is a novel approach for uncertainty estimation in HDC classifiers through a lightweight HDC ensemble with prior hypervectors. Additionally, by exploiting hypervectors as prototypes (i.e., compact representations), we develop a sample acquisition strategy for HEAL to select diverse samples within each batch for annotation. Our evaluation shows that HEAL surpasses a diverse set of baselines in AL quality and achieves notably faster acquisition than many existing state-of-the-art AL methods, recording 12× to 45,700× speedup in acquisition runtime per batch.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning has emerged as a leading approach for decentralized machine learning, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging private data. While federated learning enhances data privacy, it remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as gradient inversion and membership inference, during both the training and inference phases. Specifically, QuanCrypt-FL is designed to defend against adversaries aiming to reconstruct sensitive client data through gradient leakage or membership inference in FL settings. Homomorphic Encryption provides a promising solution by encrypting model updates to protect against such attacks, but it introduces substantial communication overhead, slowing down training and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose QuanCrypt-FL, a novel algorithm that integrates fully homomorphic encryption with low-bit quantization and pruning techniques to enhance security against inference attacks while significantly reducing computational overhead, making federated learning more efficient and resilient. Further, we propose and implement mean-based clipping to mitigate quantization overflow or errors. By integrating these methods, QuanCrypt-FL creates a communication-efficient FL framework that ensures privacy protection with minimal impact on model accuracy, thereby improving both computational efficiency and attack resilience. We validate our approach on MNIST, HAM10000, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. QuanCrypt-FL consistently outperforms existing method and matches Vanilla-FL in terms of accuracy across varying clients. Further, QuanCrypt-FL achieves up to 9× faster encryption, 16× faster decryption, and 1.5× faster inference compared to existing method, with training time reduced by up to 3×.},

This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic data-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The proposed architecture comprises of the Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) for representing operational states of the physical twin (PT), an Observation Window Extraction process for capturing relevant temporal state sequences, a Data Preprocessing Pipeline within an LLM-Based Behavior Prediction Engine for sensor data structuring and filtering, and an LLM ensemble that performs zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative artificial intelligence, DDD-GenDT reduces the need for extensive historical datasets, enabling DT construction in data-scarce environments while maintaining privacy for proprietary industrial processes. The DDDAS-driven feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt its predictive behavior in alignment with PT-specific wear and degradation patterns, thereby supporting DT-aging, which is the progressive synchronization of the DT with the evolving physical system. The proposed framework is validated using the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle motor current as the monitored variable. In a zero-shot prediction setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE of 0.479 A (4.79% of the maximum 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling both nonlinear process dynamics and changes arising from PT aging without retraining. These results demonstrate that DDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling approach, bridging the generative AI capabilities with the performance and reliability requirements of industrial DT applications.},

We aim to create an efficient identification system by applying a recently proposed physical RC model called rotating neuron reservoir (RNR) as the processing core.

The proposed system is verified by an experimentally collected heart sound dataset by laser-camera system achieving an overall accuracy of 89.03% in identifying twelve testing subjects. Additionally, the elevated heart sound from 8 subjects have been blended with their normal heart sounds to assess the robustness of the proposed system. The classification accuracy reaches over 83% in this mixed test. Furthermore, the identification system was assessed under individuals with different types of heart murmurs and abnormal heart sounds, achieving an overall accuracy of around 90%.

Existing partially spoofed audio detection methods have shown excellent effectiveness in distinguishing clean and long-duration spoofed segments. However, their robustness remains limited when malicious attackers manipulate a finer-grained segment (e.g., only a single phoneme) and employ post-processing operations to reduce detectable discontinuities. To face these challenges, we propose the Semantic-Aware Inconsistency Learning (SAIL) method for robust frame-level detection. It incorporates a robust augmentation module (RAM), a Multi-Scale Semantic Inconsistency Learning (MSIL) module, and a Semantic Separation Module (SSM) to learn robust discriminative features by capturing multi-segment discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies introduced by partially spoofed manipulations. Specifically, the RAM is applied to suppress the model's erroneous attention to additional interference caused by post-processing operations on the subtle spoofed artifacts. Then, the MSIL module is proposed to extract semantic inconsistency features after manipulations, using attention mechanisms at different scales to highlight forgery differences at various granularities. Finally, the SSM is devised to refine these features for robust frame-level detection, utilizing contrastive learning to ensure a clear distinction of inconsistent semantic features in the feature space. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, including ASVS2019PS, HAD, and LAV-DF, showing that our proposed method achieves the best performance under various noisy scenarios.},

Especially in telephonic interactions, detecting emotions accurately is crucial for improving human-computer interaction experiences. Despite significant advances in deep learning, current emotion recognition systems that integrate voice and text face challenges such as noise interference in transcripts and inadequate multimodal fusion, which hinder precise emotion detection. In this paper, we introduce MASKSER, a methodology that combines vocal signals and transcribed text in a robust manner. Our approach involves pretraining noisy transcripts with ChatGPT-4 using few-shot learning based on techniques such as masking and sentiment word replacement. This enhances emotion discernment significantly by leveraging the strengths of both modalities. To address the challenges posed by noisy data, we propose a mask-based noise generation model and use it to pretrain the transcript-based model, which helps mitigate inaccuracies. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function that evaluates the Kullback-Leibler divergence between text and voice encoder distributions, ensuring balanced contributions from both modalities. Experiments are conducted in both English and Korean to validate the language independence and robustness of the proposed approach in different linguistic contexts. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in emotion recognition capabilities, achieving high performance metrics while reducing reliance on costly speech recognition resources.},

  abstract = {Transformer architectures with multiple heads with wide attention dimensions (widths) are over-parameterized. This leads to parameter redundancy and high correlations across attention heads with only a minority of heads actively contributing to the task. In this study, we quantitatively analyze the parameter redundancy by comparing the linear centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity of learned representations extracted across attention layers and heads. Observing that widening the network can exacerbate these correlations, leading to representations with high CKA similarity, we question the design choice with uniform attention widths across all attention heads or layers and investigate how this choice impacts correlations across heads in the same layer. We design a width-adaptive training method to dynamically tune the model to keep the main contributing widths in each attention head and layer while no knowledge distillation or re-training process is needed. Experimental results on both English and Dutch corpora show our adaptive training method effectively reduces cross-head correlations and improves accuracy in automatic speech recognition. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of width-adaptive training by finetuning the OWSM speech foundation model.},

  abstract = {Few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical yet under explored scenario in dialogue systems. Existing data augmentation techniques either incorporate external data or generate hard negative samples within the feature space, which often leads to issues such as introducing knowledge bias, failing to align with the discrete nature of text, and inadequately addressing the problem of under-representation caused by in-distribution (IND) overfitting. Motivated by the recent findings that enhancing intra-class discrimination can mitigate IND overfitting, and the class of a sentence is predominantly determined by salient words, we propose EnSal, a method designed to strengthen the features of salient words in order to enhance the correlation between intent features and their corresponding classes. To achieve this, we jointly train k-nearest neighbors contrastive learning (KCL) alongside cross-entropy (CE) to improve the intra-class discrimination of intent features. Salient words are identified using both the k-nearest neighbors condition and the prediction probability condition. These words are retained as templates for synthesizing text samples, thereby avoiding the introduction of knowledge bias while preserving consistency with the discrete characteristics of text. Furthermore, we treat the synthetic text as noise samples associated with their corresponding training samples and perform denoising autoencoder (DAE) training on the augmented dataset. This process enables the identification of common and significant class features, effectively alleviating the under-representation issue. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art in few-shot OOD intent detection. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/wangpei2009job/EnSal.},

  abstract = {Superdirective beamformers are highly appealing for their superior directivity and effectiveness in suppressing diffuse noise. However, their sensitivity to sensor noise and array imperfections poses significant challenges in practice. Achieving higher robustness often necessitates a trade-off in directivity, thereby reducing their ability to suppress directional and diffuse noises. A key concern, therefore, is how to improve noise suppression while maintaining robustness. To address this, we propose in this paper a novel temporal-spatial joint high-gain beamforming method based on a Kronecker product decomposition, making use of the inter-frame correlation to improve performance. The signal model in the proposed work uses recent pairs of time frames and employs the Kronecker product of the steering vector with a frequency- and angle-dependent inter-frame correlation vector. The high-gain beamformers are formulated as Kronecker product filters, where the temporal filter is optimized to maximize the white noise gain (WNG) and the spatial filter is optimized to enhance the directivity factor (DF). With accurate estimation of the correlation vector, Kronecker product high-gain beamformers can simultaneously improve both WNG and DF. The proposed method offers flexibility and can be extended to design other types of beamformers, with a maximum WNG (MWNG) beamformer presented as an example within the same framework. This paper also explores three approaches to estimating the correlation vector: time-invariant, time-varying, and data-driven estimations. Simulation results show notable improvements in noise suppression performance across various scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the “pre-train, prompt, and predict” paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RETROPROMPT, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RETROPROMPT leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RETROPROMPT, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RETROPROMPT effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.},

At the core of our framework is the S5 state-space model, which efficiently captures complex temporal dependencies across multiple speech channels by modeling both short and long-term dynamics. To effectively integrate spatial and spectral features, our encoder employs S3Conv layers that extract salient characteristics from the raw input, while a dedicated cross-domain interaction mechanism facilitates a dynamic exchange of information between two parallel data streams used for coarse magnitude estimation and complex spectral refinement, respectively. This dual-path design enables the network to jointly enhance amplitude and phase information, resulting in improved perceptual quality and intelligibility. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in the overall architecture, confirming that the integration of state-space-based temporal sequence modeling and cross-domain feature fusion is critical for robust, high-quality speech enhancement.

  abstract = {Computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) manages to facilitate second-language (L2) learners to practice pronunciation skills by offering timely and instructive feedback. To examine pronunciation proficiency from multiple facets, existing methods for CAPT broadly fall into two categories: mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as well as automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). The former aims to pinpoint phonetic pronunciation errors and provide diagnostic feedback, while the latter seeks instead to quantify pronunciation proficiency pertaining to various aspects. Despite the natural complementarity between MDD and APA, researchers and practitioners, however, often treat them as independent tasks with disparate modeling paradigms. In light of this, we in this paper first introduce MuFFIN, a Multi-Faceted pronunciation Feedback model with an Interactive hierarchical Neural architecture, to jointly address the tasks of MDD and APA. To better capture the nuanced distinctions between phonemes in the feature space, a novel phoneme-contrastive ordinal regularization mechanism is then put forward to optimize the proposed model to generate more phoneme-discriminative features while factoring in the ordinality of the aspect scores. In addition, to address the intricate data imbalance problem in MDD, we design a simple yet effective training objective, which is specifically tailored to perturb the outputs of a phoneme classifier with the phoneme-specific variations, so as to better render the distribution of predicted phonemes meanwhile considering their mispronunciation characteristics. A series of experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the efficacy of our method in relation to several cutting-edge baselines, showing state-of-the-art performance on both the APA and MDD tasks.},

  abstract = {The problem of reconstructing a spatial sound field from microphone signals and a coarse, partial, and/or uncertain point cloud representation of the boundaries of the room is considered. This problem has downstream applications within sound field control for which precise reconstruction is essential. Typical for these applications is that only microphone measurements are considered, resulting in poor reconstruction in a large spatial region and at high frequencies when few microphones are available. In contrast, in an idealistic setting, where boundary geometry and acoustic properties are known, the sound field can be simulated as a forward problem. However, since the acquisition of such information can be costly and time-consuming, we consider the intermediate setting where partial information of the boundary geometry is available. We formulate the problem in a Bayesian setting, where the boundary information is used to form a prior distribution on the sound field. The paper extends our preliminary work in [1] by allowing for multiple impedance boundary conditions and by introducing a weighting of the boundary points. A scheme for finding an optimal weighting is introduced to reduce the influence of points far from the region of interest or points not consistent with the microphone measurements. Finally, extensive numerical simulation experiments are performed to understand the properties of the boundary-informed regularizer. To further validate the performance and robustness on real data in relation to commonly used regularizers, we release the Field LAser-calibrated Impulse Response (FLAIR) dataset. This dataset consists of 135 microphone measurements along with a laser calibrated, millimeter accurate point cloud of the room geometry and microphone positions that is aimed at stimulating further research in this domain.},

With a common way to separately process the different modalities, most current approaches establish the audio-visual correlation by maximizing the cosine similarity of representations from two streams. Unfortunately, the challenge of abundant inference parameters still limits this scheme to be further developed mainly because the parameter of modality-specific networks cannot be reused. Inspired by the mechanism of model averaging, in this study, an Iterative Multi-Modal Parameters Fusion (IMP-Fusion) strategy is proposed to fuse the network parameters during the training phase. By integrating the audio and visual knowledge into a unified architecture, a single-stream network is proposed to handle both modalities in the same time-round. Substantial experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks have validated a superior performance, even with only half of the inference parameter in comparison to the other state-of-the-art works. As a plug-and-play mechanism, the proposed IMP-Fusion strategy is also promising to benefit the design of future audio-visual networks.},

  abstract = {Score-based diffusion models for speech enhancement (SE) need to incorporate correct prior knowledge as reliable conditions to generate accurate predictions. However, providing reliable conditions using noisy features is challenging. One solution is to use features enhanced by deterministic methods as conditions. However, the information distortion and loss caused by deterministic methods might affect the diffusion process. In this paper, we first investigate the effects of using different deterministic SE models as conditions for diffusion. We validate two conditions depending on whether the noisy feature was used as part of the condition: one using only the deterministic feature (deterministic-only), and the other using both deterministic and noisy features (deterministic-noisy). Preliminary investigation found that using deterministic enhanced conditions improves DNSMOS and UTMOS on real data, while the choice between using deterministic-only or deterministic-noisy conditions depends on the deterministic models. Based on these findings, we propose the deterministic-diffusion unified model for SE to more effectively utilize both conditions. Moreover, we found that fine-grained deterministic models have greater potential in objective evaluation metrics, while UNet-based deterministic models provide more stable diffusion performance. Therefore, we also propose a deterministic model that combines coarse- and fine-grained processing for the diffusion. Experimental results on CHiME4 show that the proposed models effectively leverage deterministic models to achieve better SE evaluation scores on the DNSMOS and UTMOS for real evaluation sets. In addition, the proposed deterministic model proves to be more stable than other deterministic models when it is used for diffusion.},

Conventional FL methods typically demand more communication rounds to achieve convergence in non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) data scenarios due to their reliance on fixed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates at each Communication Round (CR). In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy to expedite the convergence of FL models, inspired by the insights from McMahan etal.'s seminal work. We focus on FL convergence via traditional SGD decay by introducing a dynamic adjusting mechanism for local epochs and local batch size. Our method adapts the decay of SGD updates during the training process, akin to decaying learning rates in classical optimization. Particularly, by adaptively reducing local epochs and increasing local batch size using their ongoing values and the CR as the model progresses, our method enhances convergence speed without compromising accuracy, specifically by effectively addressing challenges posed by non-IID data. We provide theoretical results of the benefits of the dynamic decay of SGD updates in FL scenarios. We demonstrate our method's consistent outperformance regarding the global model's communication speedup and convergence behavior through comprehensive experiments.},

To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Behavior Habits Enhanced Intention Learning framework for Session Based Recommendation (BHSBR). Specifically, we focus on the next item recommendation and design a global item transition graph to learn the behavior-aware semantic relationships between items, in order to mine the underlying similarity between items beyond the session. In addition, we construct a hypergraph to extract the diverse behavior habits of users and break through the limitations of temporal relationships in the session. Compared to the existing works, our behavior habit learning method learns behavior dependencies at the user level, which could capture the user's more accurate long-term intentions and reduce the impact of noise behaviors. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the performance of our proposed BHSBR is superior to SOTA. Further ablation experiments fully illustrate the effectiveness of our various modules.},

Due to the numerous combinations of $k$ and $h$, the quantity of $(k,h)$-cores is substantial, which necessitates considerable time and space for querying and decomposition. As a temporal graph evolves, for instance, with edges being inserted or removed from the previous snapshot, the affected $(k,h)$-cores must also be updated to reflect the latest structure. To address these challenges, we initially develop a novel $(k,h)$-core storage index that exhibits excellent query performance while consuming linear space regarding the graph size. Subsequently, we design an efficient decomposition algorithm to extract $(k,h)$-cores from a snapshot. Following this, we offer two maintenance algorithms to manage temporal graph evolution.

  abstract = {In the digital age, the overwhelming amount of information necessitates advanced recommendation systems to deliver personalized content. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as sparse user-item interactions and long-tail bias. Recent studies construct structural learning or self-supervised learning on the interaction graph achieving a positive impact on alleviating the problems, but the interaction data itself may be far too little to solve the problems. While knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a promising solution by providing semantic depth to recommendations, their integration often introduces noise from redundant knowledge. Addressing these critical gaps, this study proposes a knowledge-guided interest contrast (KGIC) to enhance recommendations, which innovatively harmonizes collaborative filtering with semantic insights from KG. The KGIC model introduces three key innovations: (1) a knowledge filtering mechanism that selectively leverages interest-relevant signals from the knowledge graph to encode interest and avoid redundant knowledge interference; (2) an adaptive graph augmentation strategy that enhances the interaction graph based on semantic-aware interest propagation and interaction intensity estimation; and (3) a self-supervised contrastive learning task that mitigates long-tail bias and sparsity issues by homogenizing the embedding distribution between augmented views. The extensive evaluation reveals the superiority of KGIC with knowledge filtering and graph augmentation for recommendation.},

This label distribution can serve as a soft target for algorithmic learning, akin to label smoothing, thereby enhancing the performance of various learning paradigms including multi-label learning, single positive multi-label learning, and partial-label learning. However, limited by dataset type and annotation inaccuracy, the same label enhancement algorithm on different datasets struggles to achieve consistent performance, for reasons derived from the following two insights: 1) Differential Contribution of Feature Space and Logical Label Space: The feature space and logical label space of different datasets contribute differently to generating an accurate label distribution; 2) Presence of Noise and Incorrect Labels: Some datasets contain noise and inaccurately labeled samples, leading to divergent outputs for similar inputs. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) as a foundational strategy, treating the feature space and the logical label space as two distinct modalities.

The modular design of STGym facilitates an in-depth analysis of model components and promotes the seamless adoption and extension of existing methods. By standardizing the training and evaluation processes, STGym ensures reproducibility and scalability, enabling fair comparisons across different models. In this paper, we use traffic forecasting, a popular research topic in the spatio-temporal domain, as a case to demonstrate the capabilities of the STGym. Our detailed survey systematically utilizes the modular framework of STGym to organize key modules into various models, thereby facilitating deeper insights into their structures and mechanisms. We also evaluate 18 models on six widely used traffic forecasting datasets and analyze critical hyperparameters to reveal their impact on performance. This study provides valuable resources and insights for developers and researchers. The source codes are available at https://github.com/JW-Shen/STGym.},

  abstract = {Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism basically generate embeddings of nodes by taking the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood and from the entire graph, respectively. However, this simple summation aggregation approach fails to distinguish between the information from a node itself or from the node's neighbours. Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious in deeper model layers. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. Instead of simply taking the sum to aggregate local or global information, we explicitly encode the difference between the information from a node itself and that from the node's local neighbours (or from the rest of the entire graph nodes). The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated representation to generate the updated node embedding. By combining differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved, and therefore the model performance is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Next POI recommendation plays a crucial role in delivering personalized location-based services, but it faces significant challenges in capturing complex user behavior and adapting to dynamic interest distributions. Most methods often provide insufficient modeling of implicit features in user trajectories, such as directional transitions and latent edge relationships, which are essential for understanding user behavior. Moreover, existing diffusion models, constrained by Gaussian priors, struggle to handle the diverse and evolving nature of user preferences. The lack of a unified scheduling for noise and sampling also limits the flexibility of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a Unified Bridge-based Diffusion model (UB-Diff) for the next POI recommendation. UB-Diff incorporates a direction-aware POI transition graph learning, which jointly captures spatio-temporal and directional features. To overcome the limitations of Gaussian priors, we introduce a bridge-based diffusion POI generative model. It can achieve distribution translation from the user's historical distribution to the target distribution by learning a bridge to associate user behavior with POI recommendation, adapting to dynamic user interests. In the end, we design a novel intermediate function to unify the diffusion process, enabling precise control over noise scheduling and modular optimization. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of UB-Diff over advanced baseline methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/JKZuo/UBDiff.},

Currently, researchers have applied deep reinforcement learning methods, for example, Rejoin and DQ, to join order selection in order to obtain high query performance. However, Rejoin and DQ cannot capture the structural characteristic of the join tree, which may lead to similar encoding structure for different execution plans. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new learning optimizer called ACJoin (asynchronous advantage Actor-Critic for multi-table Join order selection). ACJoin employs a new encoding method to capture the structural characteristics of the join tree through integrating GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). In particular, ACJoin can distinguish different execution plans. It uses A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) to guide the join order selection and reduce the time taken to find the best query plan with the minimum cost. Compared with existing search strategies, ACJoin can find the globally optimal solution with efficient and stable query performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real JOB and the synthetic TPC-H datasets. The results show that ACJoin outperforms the state-of-the-art join order selection methods and DRL Deep Reinforcement Learning)-based methods in cost and latency.},

  abstract = {Nystrom approximation is one of the most popular approximation methods to accelerate kernel analysis on largescale data sets. Nystrom employs one single landmark set to ¨ obtain eigenvectors (low-rank decomposition) and projects the entire data set to the eigenvectors (embedding). Most existing methods focus on accelerating landmark selection. For extremely large-scale data sets, however, the embedding time cost, rather than that of low-rank decomposition, is critical. In addition, both accuracy and embedding time cost are dominated by the landmark set size. As a result, using more landmarks is the only way to improve accuracy at the cost of extremely high embedding costs. In this paper, we propose a method for the first time to decouple embedding cost from that of low-rank decomposition. We first obtain the eigenvectors from a large landmark set for a low error, and then optimize a small landmark set that minimizes the landmark-set-embedding error to ensure a low embedding cost. In return, our accuracy is close to that of the large landmark set but the small one dominates the embedding time cost. Our method can deal with popular kernels and be plugged into most existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Rail-surface defect detection (RSDD) is a key technology for ensuring the safety and efficiency of railroad transportation. Existing models enhance the robustness in complex scenarios by using complementary information from visible light (RGB) image and depth data. However, incorporating depth data increases the computational complexity, which consumes more resources, increases the risk of overfitting, and decreases the model efficiency. Optimizing and streamlining multimodal data processing remains challenging. To address this issue and enable fast and accurate RSDD, this study introduces a novel lightweight scope integration network (LSINet). This method efficiently and precisely fuses the features using a lightweight double-context-aware module and refines the image quality using an adaptive Markov field smoothing module in a hierarchical decoding process. A lightweight two-dimensional scanning method that captures long-range dependencies and improves computational efficiency. We integrate this approach with local range extremes to enhance the multimodal feature fusion. Furthermore, to refine the defect edges and improve the detection accuracy, we integrate the Markov random field module into the defect segmentation and optimization using its ability to model interpixel spatial correlation, particularly for small and ambiguous defects. In designing the model, we focused on optimizing the number of parameters (e.g., computational resources). Experimental evaluations using various rail surface images demonstrated that the proposed method enhanced the defect detection accuracy and recall while reaching fast detection speeds. According to extensive experiments conducted using the industrial RGB-D dataset (i.e., NEU RSDDS-AUG), LSINet outperformed 15 state-of-the-art methods with only 27.6 million parameters.

In this paper, we propose BaDFL, a novel Backdoor Attack defense mechanism for Decentralized Federated Learning. BaDFL enhances robustness by applying strategic model clipping at the local update level. To the best of our knowledge, BaDFL is the first decentralized federated learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees against model poisoning attacks. Specifically, BaDFL achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nT}})$, where n is the number of nodes and T is the global maximum iteration number. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis under two different attack scenarios, showing that BaDFL maintains robustness within a specific defense radius. Extensive experimental results show that, on average, BaDFL can effectively defend against model poisoning within 6 mitigation rounds, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy.},

VDS also allows to efficiently replace the outsourced data by another value. However, the old authentication information can make the expired data pass the verification. To prevent this attack, VDS schemes must provide a revocation approach to revoke the old authentication information. The current approach employs the tree-like authentication structure or cryptographic accumulator, which will influence the efficiency of the VDS scheme. In this work, we find an approach to construct the low-storage VDS scheme supporting efficient revocation. Towards this end, we fully exploit the property of chameleon hash function with ephemeral trapdoor to propose a signature, which is the crucial step to construct the VDS scheme. In our VDS scheme, the size of the authentication information can be reduced to be less than the scale of the data streaming (i.e., low storage). Furthermore, the client is able to revoke the old authentication information in an efficient manner, where she only needs to release a message (i.e., efficient revocation). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VDS scheme is efficient and practical.},

  abstract     = {The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1× inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.},

However, existing works focus on the privacy-preserving schemes with traditional tree indexes, causing more computing and storage issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient conjunctive geometric range query scheme over encrypted spatial data with a learned index. In particular, we design a new privacy-preserving learned index for spatial data to reduce the search space and storage overhead. The main idea is to add noise disturbance to the objective function instead of directly adding it to output results, reducing the leakage of private information and ensuring the correctness of output results. Moreover, we propose a spatial segmentation algorithm to avoid accessing a large number of unnecessary Z codes in the query process. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme ensures index data security and query privacy. Simulation results show that the query efficiency is improved while the storage overhead is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

In applications where sorting has to be efficiently accomplished (i.e., in O(1) time) on small-sized entries, hardware accelerators, such as ASICs, FPGAs, or GPUs, are used to speed up the sorting operations. In the literature, the bitonic sort algorithm (or variants thereof) is still considered to be the most commonly used approach in many hardware sort implementations for decades. However, the time complexity of the bitonic sort is O((log(n))2) for sorting n elements, which does not satisfy the constant-time constraint we demand for our setting. In this paper, we propose competition-style sorting networks (CSNs), a framework for designing hardware-based competition-style class of sorting networks that captures all forms of two-stage sorting networks where the first stage (competition) consists of pairwise comparisons and the second stage (evaluation) ranks the entries and sorts them. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we develop and test one instance of this design, called the Competition Sort Algorithm (CSA), which has a time complexity of O(1), and specifically, one clock cycle. We implemented and tested CSA on both an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and the NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU then measured its gain, which combines the trade-offs between the relative speedup and the relative area increase, against the bitonic sort. Our results show that the CSA achieves a significant gain of up to 11.01× on the FPGA and a relative speedup of up to 3.32× on the GPU. We also compare the area, power, and latency of CSA with the bitonic sort algorithm on the FPGA.},

  abstract     = {Embodied carbon is the carbon emissions in the manufacturing process of products, which dominates the overall carbon footprint in many industries. Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g. 28nm CPU, whereas a product instance can be made in various regions and time periods. Carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a product instance can differ from its product class. Additionally, different carbon attribution methods (e.g., location-based and market-based) can affect the carbon emissions of electricity, thus further affecting the embodied carbon of products. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) accounting models with dual attribution methods. We observe significant differences between STEC and current models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference is 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) training and LLM inference. We observe that using STEC results in much greater differences in the embodied carbon of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%).},

  abstract     = {As scientific and engineering challenges grow in complexity and scale, the demand for effective solutions for sparse matrix computations becomes increasingly critical. LU decomposition, known for its ability to reduce computational load and enhance numerical stability, serves as a promising approach. This study focuses on accelerating sparse LU decomposition for circuit simulations, addressing the prolonged simulation times caused by large circuit matrices. We present a novel Operation-based Optimized LU (OOLU) decomposition architecture that significantly improves circuit analysis efficiency. OOLU employs a VLIW-like processing element array and incorporates a scheduler that decomposes computations into a fine-grained operational task flow graph, maximizing inter-operation parallelism. Specialized scheduling and data mapping strategies are applied to align with the adaptable pipelined framework and the characteristics of circuit matrices. The OOLU architecture is prototyped on an FPGA and validated through extensive tests on the University of Florida sparse matrix collection, benchmarked against multiple platforms. The accelerator achieves speedups ranging from 3.48× to 32.25× (average 12.51×) over the KLU software package. It also delivers average speedups of 2.64× over a prior FPGA accelerator and 25.18× and 32.27× over the GPU accelerators STRUMPACK and SFLU, respectively, highlighting the substantial efficiency gains our approach delivers.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by training models on edge client devices using their local data without revealing their raw data. In edge environments, various applications require different neural network models, making it crucial to perform joint training of multiple models on edge devices, known as multi-task FL. While existing multi-task FL approaches enhance resource utilization on edge devices through adaptive resource configuration or client selection, optimizing either of these aspects alone may lead to suboptimality. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a joint client selection and resource configuration method called JCSRC for multi-task FL, aiming to maximize energy efficiency in environments with limited computation and communication resources and heterogeneous client devices. Firstly, we formalize this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem considering all these characteristics and prove its NP-hardness. To address this problem, we first design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based client selection method that selects appropriate clients for each task to train their models. The MARL method makes client selection decisions based on the clients’ data quality, energy efficiency, communication, and computation capacity to ensure fast convergence and energy efficiency. Then, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based resource configuration scheme that configures appropriate computation and bandwidth resources for each task on each client. The PSO scheme makes resource configuration decisions based on theoretically derived optimal CPU frequency and bandwidth to achieve high energy efficiency. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments to validate our proposed JCSRC. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, JCSRC can save energy consumption by up to 59% to achieve the target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance demands and stringent timing requirements of safety-critical systems like avionics and autonomous vehicles, research has focused on providing timing guarantees for the scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks in multicore systems. The structural complexity and timing anomalies make this problem challenging. Existing methods bound the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks through static analysis, but these bounds are complicated, difficult to validate, and often remain pessimistic for many scheduling scenarios. Runtime intervention can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is ineffective for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leads to non-work-conserving schedules, and incurs additional overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to identify timing anomalies in DAG scheduling scenarios within a system, providing tighter WCRT solutions. The static analysis first offers a sufficient anomaly test to directly identify some anomaly-free DAG scheduling scenarios. Leveraging a wide range of scheduling data collected from the running system or its simulator, we then apply a machine learning approach to train a binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of 99.5%. Identifying the anomaly status enables the application of more precise WCRT bounds for different scheduling scenarios, leading to improved system performance. Specifically, we shorten the WCRT bounds for anomaly-free DAG scheduling by an average of up to 21.58%, with a maximum reduction of up to 55.47% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {RowHammer poses a serious reliability challenge to modern DRAM systems. As technology scales down, DRAM resistance to RowHammer has decreased by 30× over the past decade, causing an increasing number of benign applications to suffer from this issue. However, existing defense mechanisms have three limitations: 1) they rely on inefficient mitigation techniques, such as time-consuming victim row refresh; 2) they do not reduce the number of effective RowHammer attacks, leading to frequent mitigations; and 3) they fail to recognize that frequently accessed data is not only a root cause of RowHammer but also presents an opportunity for performance optimization. In this paper, we observe that frequently accessed hot data plays a distinct role in security and efficiency: it can induce RowHammer by interfering with adjacent cold data, while also being performance-critical due to its frequent accesses. To this end, we propose Data Isolation via In-DRAM Cache (DIVIDE), a novel defense mechanism that leverages in-DRAM cache to isolate and exploit hot data. DIVIDE offers three key benefits: 1) It reduces the number of effective RowHammer attacks, as hot data in the cache cannot interfere with each other. 2) It provides a simple yet effective mitigation measure by isolating hot data from cold data. 3) It caches frequently accessed hot data, improving average access latency. DIVIDE employs a two-level protection structure: the first level mitigates RowHammer in cache arrays with high efficiency, while the second level addresses the remaining threats in normal arrays to ensure complete protection. Owing to the high in-DRAM cache hit rate, DIVIDE efficiently mitigates RowHammer while preserving both the performance and energy efficiency of the in-DRAM cache. At a RowHammer threshold of 128, DIVIDE with probabilistic mitigation achieves an average performance improvement of 19.6% and energy savings of 20.4% over DDR4 DRAM for fourcore workloads. Compared to an unprotected in-DRAM cache DRAM, DIVIDE incurs only a 2.1% performance overhead while requiring just a modest 1KB per-channel CAM in the memory controller, with no modification to the DRAM chip.},

  abstract     = {Abstract—Asynchronous common subset (ACS) is a powerful paradigm enabling applications such as Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) and multi-party computation (MPC). The most efficient ACS framework in the information-theoretic setting is due to Ben-Or, Kelmer, and Rabin (BKR, 1994). The BKR ACS protocol has been both theoretically and practically impactful. BKR ACS has an O(log $n$) running time (where $n$ is the number of replicas) due to the usage of $n$ parallel asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances, impacting both performance and scalability. Indeed, for a network of 16∼64 replicas, the parallel ABA phase occupies about 95%∼97% of the total runtime. A long-standing open problem is whether we can build an ACS framework with O(1) time while not increasing the message or communication complexity of the BKR protocol. We resolve the open problem, presenting the first constant-time ACS protocol with O($n$3) messages in the information-theoretic and signature-free settings. Our key ingredient is the first information-theoretic and constant-time multivalued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol. Our results can improveߞasymptotically and concretelyߞvarious applications using ACS and MVBA. As an example, we implement FIN, a BFT protocol instantiated using our framework. Via a 121-server deployment on Amazon EC2, we show FIN reduces the overhead of the ABA phase to as low as 1.23% of the total runtime.},

Compared to Linux, we achieve an average speedup of 3.5× and a maximum of up to 15.4×. We also achieve an average code size reduction of 84% and a maximum of up to 90%. By moving application code from user space to kernel space, an additional code size reduction up to 56% and a speedup up to 1.3× can be achieved. Compared to FreeRTOS, the use of Miosix only costs a moderate amount of code size (at most 47KB) for significant advantages in application performance with speedups averaging at 1.5× and up to 5×.},

It is lightweight in space and time complexities, but suffers from suboptimal partitioning quality, especially for directed graphs where the explicit knowledge provided for heuristic is limited. This paper thereby proposes new heuristics for not only vertex-based but also edge-based partitioning. They improve quality by additionally utilizing implicit knowledge, which is embedded in the local streaming view and the global graph view. Memory reduction techniques are presented to extract this knowledge with negligible space costs. That preserves the lightweight advantages of streaming partitioning. Besides, we study parallel acceleration and restreaming, to further boost the partitioning efficiency and quality.

However, serverless applications' complexity and dynamic nature pose significant challenges in ensuring system availability and performance. Many root cause analysis (RCA) methods exist for microservice systems, but they are unsuitable for precisely modeling serverless applications. This is because: (1) Compared to microservices, serverless applications exhibit a highly dynamic nature. They have a short lifecycle and only generate instantaneous pulse-like data, lacking long-term continuous information. (2) Existing methods primarily concentrate on the runtime stage, neglecting other stages and failing to account for the complete lifecycle of serverless applications. (3) Current methods exhibit inadequate comprehension and optimization of multi-modal features, leading to lower model accuracy and exorbitant training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FaaSScout, a fast and complete lifecycle root cause analysis method for FaaS applications. It integrates multi-modal observability data generated from the platform and application side using Global Call Graph. We employ feature reduction techniques to enhance feature efficacy and train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based graph auto-encoder to compute reconstruction scores for the nodes in the global call graph. Based on the scores, we incorporate historical node stability and transition probabilities to determine the root cause at the granularity of the lifecycle stage of serverless functions. We evaluate on two serverless benchmarks, the results show that FaaSScout outperforms other baseline methods with a top-k precision improvement ranging from 21.28% to 82.91%.},

Our key idea is to explore semantic clusters from both instance-level and clusterlevel perspectives. At the cluster level, we assume that the highest-confidence partitions possess reasonable semantic divisions; at the instance level, we assume that neighboring samples belong to the same semantic category. With the constraints of the cluster level and instance level, the intracluster compactness and interclass discrepancy are increased. Clustering results heavily rely on the quality of image representations. Therefore, we introduce strong data augmentations with three shared-weight backbone networks to learn the most inherent features.

In this paper, we propose a meta-reinforcement learning framework for social robot navigation that empowers robots to adapt to a variety of environments. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of utilizing social norms to guide social navigation for the first time. We employ field modeling to represent interactions among the environment, pedestrians, and robots. Historical pedestrian motion data is utilized as training input for physical information neural networks, which generate pedestrian movement vector fields within the environment. We then incorporate the similarity between the robot’s predicted motion state and its actual motion state into the reward function, guiding the robot’s learning process in alignment with social norms. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the robot’s social navigation capabilities.

GSMVMD adopts a unique grouped expansion strategy to produce more effective co-frequencies, while we have also improved the algorithm frame-work by combining successive extraction strategy. GSMVMD first uses channel-by-channel Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to determine the center frequency of each channel, and then performs frequency-grouped normalization. Subsequently, a variational optimization model is established based on the grouped results, and the optimal solution for GSMVMD model is obtained using the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we conduct experiments using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as an example to verify the superiority of the GSMVMD algorithm, and design a Grouped Standard Deviation of degree (GSD) parameters to measure the connectivity between EEG channels, providing a new analytical perspective.},

  abstract     = {Hand gesture recognition is a key technology in the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). This paper proposes a depth-based lightweight dynamic hand gesture recognition framework for HRI, which includes a 3D hand pose estimation network based on biogeometry constraints (BCPoseNet) and a dynamic hand gesture recognition network based on multi-stream residual attention (MRAGesNet). BCPoseNet leverages its lightweight multi-flow hierarchy structure to extract and refine the skeletons of palm and five fingers respectively. Meanwhile, a set of biogeometry loss functions are designed to further constrain the relative position of skeletons. MRAGesNet constructs a lightweight 1D ConvNet baseline, on which an adaptive cross-channel residual block (ACR) and multi-channel attention mechanism (MAM) are introduced to explore the linkage mechanisms of gesture semantics and further enhance recognition performance. A feature calculation component is designed which enables a seamless integration of the framework through the transformation of 4 functions. The proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and speed that are evaluated extensively on 4 public datasets and 1 custom dataset. In addition, a hand gesture imitation experiment on a hand-arm robot platform proves the application performance of the proposed framework for HRI.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of networked systems is a significant problem due to the susceptibility of modern infrastructures to adversarial interference. A central component of this problem is how defensive resources should be allocated to mitigate the severity of potential attacks on the system. In this paper, we consider a General Lotto game where a defender and attacker deploy resources on the nodes of a network, and the objective is to secure as many links as possible. The defender secures a link only if it out-competes the attacker on both of its associated nodes. For bipartite networks, we completely characterize equilibrium payoffs and strategies for both the defender and attacker. Surprisingly, the resulting payoffs are the same for any bipartite graph. On arbitrary networks, we provide lower and upper bounds on the defender's max-min value. Notably, the equilibrium payoff from bipartite networks serves as the lower bound. This suggests that more connected networks are easier to defend against attacks. These findings are confirmed through numerical solutions of a convex optimization problem geared towards obtaining tighter upper bounds for arbitrary graph structures.},

It is thus important to control such systems to maintain or restore their stability. Traditional approaches rely on real-time state measurements for feedback control, but this can be challenging in many real-world systems, such as the brain, due to their complex and dynamic nature. This paper utilizes vibrational control, an open-loop strategy, to regulate network stability. Unlike conventional methods targeting network nodes, our approach focuses on manipulating network edges through vibrational inputs. We establish sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for vibration-induced functional modifications of network edges and stabilization of network systems as a whole. Additionally, we provide methods for designing effective vibrational control inputs and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.},

Furthermore, an adaptive state feedback strategy is developed for consensus of the FOMASs with inaccurate coupling gains. Different from the traditional integer-order adaptive strategies, the designed fractional-order adaptive law, based on the Caputo fractional-order derivative and the communication topology, is able to effectively regulate the coupling gain, which provides a more realistic representation of system performance metrics due to the memory and hereditary properties of fractional-order derivatives.

We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions; in particular, the graphs' average degrees only need to grow faster than $\log n$.},

Most existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks: weak image-text semantic correlation and the hybridity of entity types in intermodality alignment. To this end, a general framework ProMNER is proposed for unimodal and multimodal NER tasks, which includes text-driven visual-modality enhancement (TVE) and prompt-guided type-related refinement and interaction (PTRI). Specifically, to alleviate the bias caused by irrelevant visual content, TVE employs cross-modal translation to generate visual representations that replace the original ones. Furthermore, the generated can serve directly as an additional input modality for NER, enabling the framework to be generalized to unimodal and multimodal NER tasks. Subsequently, to tackle the hybridity problem of intermodality entity alignment, type-filled question prompts are designed as guidance information to explicitly refine type-related visual representations. PTRI obtains type-specific multimodal representations by capturing semantic intermodality interactions for each type, and learns a comprehensive multimodal representation through dynamic weighting. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and generality of ProMNER in unimodal and multimodal NER tasks.},

  abstract     = {Involution, characterized by intensified competition for limited social resources without generating additional societal value, has become a critical issue in modern social systems. This study aims to investigate effective mechanisms to mitigate involution by incorporating other-regarding preferences (ORP) into evolutionary game dynamics on complex networks and in well-mixed populations. Through numerical simulations conducted on square lattices and small-world networks, we systematically analyze the combined effects of crucial parameters including total social resources, the cost of more effort, fairness in resource distribution, and the intensity of ORP on the evolutionary dynamics of involution. Our findings reveal that increasing social resources generally exacerbates involution, whereas greater fairness in resource distribution alleviates it. Notably, the influence of more effort costs on involution is nonlinear and context-dependent, modulated by the interaction between resource abundance and ORP intensity. Critically, ORP emerges as a decisive factor: stronger ORP substantially suppresses involution, promotes the emergence and spatial stability of cooperative clusters, and reduces the equilibrium proportion of defectors. Theoretical analysis based on replicator dynamics validate our simulation results, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for the observed phenomena. This study not only advances the theoretical understanding of involution dynamics but also offers practical insights for addressing involution in real-world social systems. It highlights the importance of cultivating altruistic social norms and ensuring fairness in resource allocation to effectively mitigate involution.},

Most existing studies focus on encryption algorithms and access control to ensure data security. They often ignore the credibility of data providers, which affects data quality and reduces user participation. To address these issues, this article proposes a blockchain-based and reputation-enhanced health data trading model. A fine-grained reputation value calculation method based on the Beta distribution is introduced to objectively evaluate the behavior of data providers. Based on this, a consensus mechanism linked to reputation value is designed to improve consensus efficiency and avoid centralization of node selection. Furthermore, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the reward and punishment mechanism in the trading process. It explores the dynamic balance between platform cost and user willingness to share. Experimental results show that the model ensures secure health data sharing, while effectively improving data usability, system fairness, and user participation.},

Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on network topology or diffusion patterns, our model integrates user motives, topic interests through keyword template-based topic distribution, and influence metrics within communities. Combining these with rumor propagation statistics, structural characteristics, and neighborhood connectivity provides a robust input to the graph neural network (GNN) model. Experiments on three real-world social media datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving an average F1-score of 0.92.

Nevertheless, existing approaches predominantly rely on a single augmentation strategy to construct contrastive views, often failing to effectively balance feature perturbation with semantic preservation. To overcome this limitation, we propose motif-guided multiview contrastive learning (MMCL), a unified framework for contrastive augmentation. MMCL leverages diverse view generation strategies across the user–item bipartite graph and the KG, perturbing graph structures while preserving essential semantics to the greatest extent possible. Specifically, for collaborative signals, we devise a data augmentation mechanism to model the interaction dynamics between users and items. For semantic information, we introduce a novel graph augmentation technique by constructing an interactive motif KG, enabling semantic contrastive learning within localized views. Furthermore, joint enhancement of graph and interaction data allows the model to capture global topological features of nodes. MMCL integrates contrastive learning at both local and global levels, effectively embedding local semantics and global topology into the learned representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets reveal that MMCL outperforms advanced methods, particularly in scenarios with sparse interactions and noisy KG, while significantly alleviating popularity bias in recommendation.},

With the wider application of GNN, recent work has revealed that it is vulnerable toward privacy leakage (e.g., property inference). How dose contrastive learning influence privacy leakage of GNN? To address the issue, for the first time we comprehensively evaluate the privacy leakage of contrastive learning for GNN. Specifically, we conduct property inference attack on GNN and evaluate the leakage from the perspective of graph augmentation, encoders, negative sampling and privacy preservation on seven graph contrastive learning (GCL) models with five datasets. Based on extensive experiments, several important insights are gained. 1) Contrastive learning will make GNN more vulnerable to property inference attack than supervised GNNs, e.g., the inference accuracy on GCL models is $\boldsymbol{\times\sim}$1.42 of that of supervised GNNs. 2) The strategy of node augmentation in contrastive learning will make the property of the graph easier to steal among all strategies, e.g., it achieves average inference accuracy (ACC) of 83.89% on the node augmentation. 3) Negative sampling based on rationale-aware will lead to easier leakage of graph properties than other strategies, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack is 100% when using rationale-aware. 4) The better performance results of the graph encoder, the more privacy leakage of the graph property, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack reaches 83.89% on average, and reaches 84.40% when GIN is used as the encoder. 5) The simpler the structure of the graph, the more vulnerable its graph properties are, i.e., the AIDS dataset achieved the highest ACC of 90.96 with the simplest structure. 6) Existing privacy-preserving methods for supervised GNN are deficient for GCL, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack after defence maintains 96% of the nondefensive ones. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analyze of the reasons behind these observations for better understanding of robust contrastive learning for GNN.},

However, current MI recognition approaches primarily utilize complex attention modules for higher recognition accuracy, consequently hindering real-time BCI implementation. Furthermore, existing methods often overlook inter-subject variability, leading to inadequate generalization of model. Additionally, traditional BCI systems lack closed-loop feedback from the machine to the brain. To address these limitations, we develop a novel closed-loop motor imagery BCI system, which encompasses a spectral-temporal refined attention network via contrastive mutual learning (STRA-CML) and a brain-controlled perceived hand exoskeleton. Specifically, we first design a spectral temporal refined attention block to capture the most discriminative spectral and temporal features. Second, we investigate a contrastive mutual learning strategy incorporating supervised-contrastive learning to enhance the generalization of our STRA-CML. Finally, a brain–machine closed-loop interaction platform based on perceived hand exoskeleton is developed to validate the feasibility of the proposed STRA-CML and provide kinesthetic and visual feedback synchronized with MI. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our STRA-CML, indicating that our STRA-CML achieves superior classification performance of 83.89% on BCI IV 2a dataset, 86.93% on BCI IV 2b dataset, and 82.79% on self-collected dataset.},

This study introduces the dynamic plug-and-play language model (DPPLM), which integrates a transformer-based language model with two attribute models to generate strategic and empathetic responses.

This work constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) from judicial decisions and employs transformer-based heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to analyze the behavioral patterns of plaintiffs. By leveraging deep contextual features from the KG, this study uncovers hidden social relationships among plaintiffs, revealing organized litigation behaviors facilitated by shared legal resources, such as lawyers, law offices, and common defendants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to uncover and validate hidden social connections among consumer-plaintiffs in China using a KG and a transformer-based HGNN framework. The findings reveal significant community structures, indicating that plaintiffs may frequently act in organized groups in lawsuit activities. This study advances methodological approaches by integrating HGNNs for link prediction and modularity-based community detection, offering actionable insights into the dynamics of grassroots litigation.

The round-robin protocol is applied to nonuniformly sampled outputs, optimizing information transmission efficiency and enhancing overall system performance. To tackle potential limitations in state data acquisition, a token-dependent static output feedback controller is developed that addresses the complexities introduced by nonperiodic sampling and asynchronous premise variables.

  abstract     = {All-in-one image restoration methods, as opposed to conventional image restoration methods, reconstruct images impaired by various degradations within a unified model, eliminating the need for separate network parameters for each task. However, current all-in-one image restoration approaches tackle various types of image degradation using an identical underlying model, neglecting the inherent variability in complexity across different image restoration tasks, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. To address this limitation, this article introduces the arbitrary routing framework (ARF), designed to effectively assess the difficulty of image restoration tasks and identify the most suitable network structure based on these complexities. This framework can be integrated with existing all-in-one image restoration models, enabling efficient inference by activating various proportions of the entire network, that is subnetworks, based on their task-specific complexities. More specifically, the ARF comprises two principal components: 1) the arbitrary routing backbone (ARB) and 2) a task-specific neural architecture search (T-NAS). The ARB incorporates a routing layer between consecutive convolutional groups, offering a wide array of potential subnetwork configurations while adding only negligible extra parameters. Concurrently, T-NAS autonomously identifies the most effective subnetworks for each image restoration task, optimizing both performance and efficiency through an efficiency-aware reward function. Comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that the ARF significantly improves performance metrics, that is, an increase of 0.31 in reconstruction PSNR, while also achieving a notable reduction in computational demands by 37.1% compared with the benchmark AirNet method. The code has been made available in the supplementary materials.},

To reduce the communication burden of signal transmission between the control box and actuator box or among agents and to enhance the security of information exchange, a dual-link coded scheme is proposed to compress each transmitted information into an L-length string. Furthermore, since the intrinsic complexity of nonlinear systems often causes TPP methods to fail in meeting constraints during the initial stages of operation, an adaptive prescribed performance (APP) scheme is introduced. By utilizing auxiliary functions, the APP is capable of dynamically adjusting performance boundaries, enabling seamless adaptation to varying initial system conditions. As a result, it ensures the tracking error is rigorously guaranteed to remain within a user-defined range over a prescribed time horizon, effectively accommodating diverse initial conditions of the system. By integrating DL-CEC with the APP method, the proposed control strategy ensures bounded consensus tracking with reduced communication cost and prescribed-time performance under arbitrary initial conditions.

At the communication layer, an encryption–decryption mechanism is developed to safeguard information exchange among agents, preventing internal states from being identified by eavesdroppers. At the control layer, to ensure strict adherence to output constraints regardless of whether the original command complies with safety limits, an improved boundary protection method is explored to generate a safety reference trajectory, which is subsequently used in the controller design. Adaptive laws are then formulated to counteract the effects of unknown nonlinearities and disturbances. Finally, by leveraging predefined-time stability theory, a predefined-time safe cooperative controller is designed to ensure error convergence within a user-defined settling time.

In this event, most of the currently available indicators expose deficiency in regard of the false or missed alarms due to the coupled condition interference. To address this issue and improve the reliability of the mechatronic system, a novel statistic discrepancy oriented cyclo-non-stationary (CNS) indicator is developed in this article. First, characteristics of the recorded degradation samples are revealed by a multiparametric model, during which the consistency is verified and improved by the hypothesis test. Second, a specific speed-dependent slicing (SDS) operator is then designed, aiming to alleviate the varying-speed-induced modulation interference at the different degradation stages. With this developed SDS operator, a CNS indicator, which can well adapt to the dynamically varying environment during the operating process, is subsequently developed by incorporating the resampling-based statistic discrepancy evaluating mechanism. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively characterize the health state of the transmission parts of the industrial WT under varying speed conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address the problem of prescribed-time distributed convex optimization (DCO) for a class of networked Euler–Lagrange systems (NELSs) operating over undirected connected graphs. By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient values of local objective functions and facilitating local information exchanges among neighboring agents, we construct a set of auxiliary systems that collaboratively seek the optimal solution. The prescribed-time DCO problem is then reformulated as a prescribed-time stabilization challenge of an interconnected error system. We propose a prescribed-time small-gain criterion to characterize the prescribed-time stabilization of the system, presenting a novel approach that enhances effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization methods for interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the auxiliary systems, we design innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers for the subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence is achieved through the introduction of time-varying gains that increase to infinity as time approaches the prescribed deadline. The Lyapunov function, along with prescribed-time mapping, is employed to establish the prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of internal signals. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Distributed formation tracking control with obstacle avoidance of multiagent systems (MASs) under random switching topologies and external disturbances is considered in this article. To achieve the complex objective, an effective control strategy is developed in three steps. First, under the transition probability (TP)-based mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching topologies, a distributed objective trajectory achieves almost sure global exponential tracking of the desired formation trajectory. Second, a safe objective trajectory approach is designed by geometrically projecting the unsafe parts of the existing formation trajectory onto the boundary of the obstacle region. Finally, an integral-multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function (IMBLF) is proposed to allow agents to track the safe objective trajectory, where the IMBLF can further guarantee the safety of the MASs. One of the interesting merits of our results is that the impulsive increasing of Lyapunov function at switching instants which is necessary for classical analysis methods has been removed. The feasibility of the proposed formation control method with obstacle avoidance is verified by simulations.},

Then, a novel fractional-order sliding mode controller is designed, where the predictor is used rather than the system state, reducing the dependence on directly measurable system states and enhancing the dynamic response of the system. Furthermore, a disturbance observer is designed to estimate the disturbance, allowing the controller to correspondingly compensate for it, and the robustness of the system is improved.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning on data streams with concept drift has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Many existing algorithms have achieved promising results on low-dimensional data streams by leveraging unlabeled data and adapting to nonstationary distributions. However, real-world data streams often exhibit complex entanglement and high dimensionality, which are usually overlooked by current approaches, resulting in fragile classification performance. This highlights the need for effective representation learning on evolving data streams to enhance the reliability of model prediction. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm for online semi-supervised learning on high-dimensional data streams by learning from contrastive evolving micro-clusters (MCs), named CEMC. Unlike existing methods, CEMC explicitly mitigates feature entanglement through contrastive MC representation learning, with model initialization guided by contrastive objectives and representation updates triggered by potential drift. To ensure reliable semi-supervised learning, we further model the reliability of contrastive MCs to support online classification and enable rapid adaptation to concept drift. By maintaining contrastive MCs online, CEMC preserves and adapts to evolving concepts within a limited memory budget, while sustaining a discriminative representation space. Empirical results on fourteen real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CEMC compared to six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has garnered extensive attention in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. VLN involves time series information, where historical observations contain rich contextual knowledge and play a crucial role in navigation. However, current methods do not explicitly excavate the connection between rich contextual information in history and the current environment, and ignore adaptive learning of clues related to the current environment. Therefore, we explore a Prompt Learning-based strategy which adaptively mines information in history that is highly relevant to the current environment to enhance the agent’s perception of the current environment and propose a history-guided prompt generation (HGPG) framework. Specifically, HGPG includes two parts, one is an entropy-based history acquisition module that assesses the uncertainty of the action probability distribution from the preceding step to determine whether historical information should be used at the current time step. The other part is the prompt generation module that transforms historical context into prompt vectors by sampling from an end-to-end learned token library. These prompt tokens serve as discrete, knowledge-rich representations that encode semantic cues from historical observations in a compact form, making them easier for the decision network to understand and utilize. In addition, we share the token library across various navigation tasks, mining common features between different tasks to improve generalization to unknown environments. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON, R2R-CE) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Here, we study how individual decision-making behaviors evolve when the topology of network interactions is weighted, and how the network of mixed coordinating and anti-coordinating games is driven to an equilibrium. We prove that the weighted pure coordinating or anti-coordinating decision-making dynamics, under both asynchronous and partially synchronous updates, will converge to the NE after finite strategy switches. Moreover, it follows that the upper bound on the number of switches for the convergence depends on the number of agents and the weights’ distribution under asynchronous update. For mixed coordinating and anti-coordinating games, we find that network game dynamics can be decoupled into convergence and nonconvergence regions under certain conditions, in which the global convergence can be established by adding leaf vertices. For more general cases, we devise the incentive mechanisms for agents to achieve the convergence. We also extend the incentive performance of fully asynchronous updating to the partially synchronous updating. Our results provide hints on the typology and incentive mechanisms to induce the convergence of mixed gaming networks.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization has garnered significant attention, such as in multitask evolutionary optimization (MTEO), which aims to solve complex problems by simultaneously optimizing multiple tasks. While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multidomain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph-learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.},

Explicit upper bounds for both time and ECs are derived, demonstrating their dependence not only on the group size and control parameters, but also on the duration of DoS attacks. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations consistently demonstrate that shorter attack durations facilitate faster convergence and lower energy consumption. Additionally, our analysis uncovers a tradeoff between TC and EC under DoS attacks, suggesting that optimal communication intensity should be carefully adjusted to meet specific performance requirements of practical applications.},

MDT is supposed to improve patient prognosis, making the treatment generation process a multiattribute multiexpert decision-making (MAMEDM) problem. Traditional MAMEDM models often necessitate experts with differing opinions to conform to group consensus, neglecting experts’ willingness to adjust opinions. To address this issue, this study proposes an MAMEDM framework which can maximize experts’ willingness for opinion transformation. Initially, a linguistic scale function is used to preprocess linguistic evaluations. A fuzzy clustering algorithm is introduced to cluster experts. The weights of subgroups are determined based on the network centrality and the professional titles of experts. Expert opinions within subgroups are aggregated based on the principle of maximizing the willingness of experts for opinion transformation, and then the ORESTE method is implemented to rank treatment options. A case study on lung cancer treatment option generation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Results show that considering experts’ willingness to revise evaluations significantly enhances decision acceptance and reduces the impact of noncooperative behaviors.},

First, the mathematical expression of dead zone nonlinearity and actuator failure is combined and then divided into a desired control signal and a nonlinear input error. Second, by summing the input errors and external disturbances, adaptive boundary control and parameter compensation laws are designed for the RBBS to ensure vibration attenuation and regulate the rotating speed of the disk to a desired value. Third, the constructed control schemes ensure uniformity ultimately and boundedness regulation of the state variables, which is proved through the Lyapunov direct method.

  abstract     = {The knowledge tracing (KT) aims to track changes in students’ knowledge status and predict their future answers based on their historical answer records. Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting student’ future performance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these approaches ignore the distractors (such as slipping and guessing) in the answering process and overlook that static cognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that there are no distractors in the answering process and that the record representations fully represent the students’ level of understanding and proficiency in knowledge. In this case, it may lead to many lack of synergy and incoordination issue in the original records. Therefore we propose a cognitive representation optimization for KT (CRO-KT) model, which utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize structure of cognitive representations. This ensures that the structure matches the students’ cognitive patterns in terms of the difficulty of the exercises. Furthermore, we use the co-optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representations of the subtarget exercises in terms of the overall situation of exercises responses by considering all the exercises with co-relationships as a single goal. Meanwhile, the CRO-KT model fuses the learned relational embeddings from the bipartite graph with the optimized record representations in a weighted manner, enhancing the expression of students’ cognition. Finally, experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets respectively to validate the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive representation optimization model.

This article introduces distributed control laws that integrate nonholonomic motion constraints into bearing-based designs to enable time-varying formation tracking with minimal onboard resources. Unlike state-of-the-art formation control solutions, this approach maintains formation shape through relative bearing feedback and orientation alignment rather than tracking global target locations or regulating interagent relative positions and velocities. This distributed controller design has been validated in two deployment scenarios: 1) leaderless nonhierarchical formations and 2) leader–follower hierarchical formations. In hierarchical formations, follower agents employ a speed estimator within the orientation alignment framework to reach velocity consensus with the leader agent. The proposed controllers guarantee accurate tracking of time-varying reference trajectories, preserve the desired formation structures, and achieve velocity consensus for both nonhierarchical and hierarchical formations, as established by analysis and validated through simulations and experiments.},

To accurately depict complex attack behaviors, a piecewise homogeneous semi-Markov chain (SMC) model modulated by a superstratum Markov chain is introduced, which can simultaneously describe the randomness of attack mode transitions and the time-varying nature of transition probabilities. Considering that the actual attack modes are inaccessible, an observer-based mode switching delay technique is designed to solve this challenge. Under the framework of a piecewise homogeneous SMC, a sufficient criterion is established to ensure the ς-error mean-square stability under random multichannel DoS attacks by means of a Lyapunov function depending on observed attack modes, piecewise homogeneous variables, and ET. Moreover, matrix decoupling and convexification techniques are employed to reduce the computational complexity.

First, to deal with the obstacle arising from inherent feedforward nonlinearity, a crucial aspect of the design is to creatively construct the coordinate transformation at each step and the prescribed-time function as a scaling factor. Subsequently, a novel prescribed-time homogeneous domination framework for feedforward MASs is developed. The significant advantage is that this framework combines the low complexity of homogeneous domination control method design with the simplicity of stability analysis for state-scale schemes. Then, based on the recursive techniques, a distributed prescribed-time full-state consensus controller is designed, which drives the consensus errors to reach equilibrium at any prescribed time and ensures the stability of the entire time interval. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated through the liquid-level control resonant circuit (LLCRC) system.},

  abstract     = {EMTO aims to optimize multiple tasks simultaneously. In recent years, various evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) algorithms based on knowledge transfer (KT) have been developed to utilize the information from other tasks and promote the optimization of the current task. However, most of them often use the fixed KT probability (ktp) and a single evolutionary search operator (ESO) during the evolution process, which lacks an adaption mechanism and cannot meet the different searching requirements among multiple tasks. Fuzzy system can effectively express the qualitative knowledge with unclear boundaries, which has good adaptability to nonindependent EMTO. Therefore, this article proposes a fuzzy adaptive multitask optimization (FAMTO), which employs a fuzzy adaptive transfer (FAT) strategy for intertask KT to achieve the adaptive adjustment of the ktp by designing a comprehensive evaluation in KT performance from two aspects, including the SR and the quality of transferred offspring. In FAT strategy, the fuzzy logical is employed to handle the interdependent relationships among multiple indicators, further achieving the more robust and adaptive ktp adjustment. In addition, an individual-based random selection (IRS) strategy is developed for each individual to choose the suitable ESO for intratask self-evolution in FAMTO. Experimental results show that FAMTO achieves significantly better performance than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms on two well-known multitask benchmarks, CEC17 and CEC22. Furthermore, FAMTO is applied to a real-world multitask planar kinematic arm control application, demonstrating its applicability. Finally, the extended experiments on many-task optimization problems (MaTOPs) illustrate the scalability of FAMTO.},

Due to the significant performance and area overheads incurred, designers start to selectively apply security-driven constraints to achieve the design targets, but they often ignore that parts of a design may be more vulnerable to hardware Trojan attacks. In this study, the differences in vulnerability to hardware Trojan attacks are also considered in the MPSoC design process, and a security-driven task scheduling method is proposed to minimize both the design vulnerability and chip area under deadline constraints. First, the schedule length is iteratively optimized by a maximum weight independent set-based method that minimizes the vulnerability increment. Second, tasks are assigned to IP vendors with a minimized number of cores required by maximizing the core sharing of tasks. Finally, tasks are scheduled to time periods using the force-directed scheduling method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing the number of cores while maintaining system security under deadline constraints.},

However, the massive market adoption of highly parallel systems, with advanced technology nodes, in several domains exacerbates the need for highly reliable systems. Formerly, most reliability evaluations targeted FP hardware. Unfortunately, fine-grain assessments on cores with recent arithmetic format alternatives, such as Posit (particularly suited for Artificial Intelligence), have remained partially unexplored. Similarly, the effects of corruption on operations due to faulty hardware are not well-known, which may prevent the proposal of effective mitigation mechanisms. This work exhaustively evaluates the fine-grain effects of permanent faults in the hardware of arithmetic cores for the three most extensively used operations in modern applications (Add, Multiply, and Multiply and Add), including machine learning, implemented in Posit and FP. Our results indicate that Posit cores are less fault-vulnerable than FP ones. However, Posit cores are more prone to induce significant operational corruption than FP ones (5.2% to 7.5%). We also found that absolute errors in faulty FP cores are higher by up to 2 orders of magnitude than in Posit ones. Finally, we applied and evaluated three mitigation mechanisms (Self-Check and repair, Dual Modular Redundancy, and Triple Modular Redundancy), effectively reducing the most critical errors with moderate area costs (20% to 110%).},

However, this has been neglected by existing studies. To fill this gap, we propose a transfer optimization framework for automatically co-evolving high-performance PAPs. Specifically, we develop a novel performance-oriented dynamic instance grouping strategy to divide problem instances into groups, each of which is associated with a subpopulation of individuals tasked with evolving a component solver. Additionally, the framework incorporates an adaptive knowledge transfer strategy that automatically identifies when and how to transfer knowledge among instance groups.

Existing approaches, often based on surrogate models, aim to approximate objective functions but struggle to generalize across heterogeneous tasks, depend on task-specific sampling, and require frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm–Single Step Generative Model (MFEA-SSG), a meta-learning-inspired framework that learns to generate high-quality solutions across tasks. Inspired by meta-learning, we treat each random shuffle of the decision variables as a unique pseudo-task, training the model on a distribution of these tasks to learn a task-agnostic prior about the structure of elite solutions. This process disrupts task-specific dependencies, allowing the model to learn transferable structures from recomposed samples. We then adopt a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of optimal solutions, enabling knowledge transfer across tasks without directly approximating objective functions. To reduce inference cost, we introduce a student model distilled from the diffusion process. Unlike conventional diffusion models that denoise iteratively, the student generates solutions in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments on both general multitask benchmarks and a real-world protein mutation prediction scenario demonstrate that MFEA-SSG achieves high-quality solutions with fast convergence and low computational cost under limited evaluation budgets, outperforming state-of-the-art general and ExMTOPs algorithms.},

With the emergence of various applications utilizing small domain-specific datasets and limited computing resources for extensive model training and deployment, there is an increasing demand for customized lightweight YOLO architectures. In this paper, we propose a general NeuroEvolution-based method, termed YOLO-Light, designed to automatically create lightweight variants of YOLO architectures tailored to object detection tasks across diverse scenarios. For a given task, YOLO-Light first initializes a population of minimal YOLO architectures and subsequently evolves these models within a novel parallel-chain evolutionary space. This process employs a diversity-protecting evolutionary search strategy until some architectures meet the expected performance standards. During evolution, YOLO-Light incorporates a dynamic evolution regulation mechanism to adjust the evolutionary configuration, thereby enhancing efficiency based on the current evolutionary state. We applied YOLO-Light to generate lightweight YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 architectures for object detection on the Roboflow 100 small dataset collection, which comprises 100 diverse datasets spanning 7 distinct imagery domains, with a total of 224,714 images and 829 classes. Our experiments focused on 20 datasets ranging from 105 to 8,992 images and 1 to 53 classes. The experimental results show that YOLO-Light reduced the number of parameters by 54–95%, while maintaining or improving mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to standard YOLO architectures. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLO-Light in generating lightweight, task-specific YOLO architectures for resource-constrained object detection tasks.

  abstract     = {Multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), which contain multiple distinct Pareto sets, are found in many real-world applications. Their multi-modality characteristics require algorithms to be specifically designed to enhance the diversity in the decision space. However, existing methods often struggle to achieve either desired diversity or satisfactory convergence speed, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To address this issue, we propose an evolutionary framework that employs a size-imbalanced dual population to balance the convergence and diversity in the decision space. Specifically, a large main population, guided by non-zero mask vectors, searches promising regions of the decision space for fast convergence. On the other hand, a small complementary population is guided by a mask vector that is bitwise complementary to those of the main population, enabling it to focus on the unexplored areas and ensure comprehensive coverage of the search space. Periodically, the two populations and their corresponding mask vectors are updated by inter-and intra-population information exchanges, allowing them to collaboratively adjust their search directions and effectively address multi-modality challenges. Additionally, to further enhance the search efficiency, a clustering-enhanced genetic operator is designed to update different populations by adaptively applying either exploration or exploitation search phases. Last, we introduce a new evaluation metric, termed the multi-objective multi-modal index, to evaluate the multi-modality performance of algorithms in real-world MMOPs without reliance on groundtruth data. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms on (non-) multi-modal benchmarks and real-world applications with substantially reduced computational time.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are effective for solving Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization Problems which optimal solutions subsets distributed regularly in the decision space. Existing EAs, however, are hard to achieve good diversity in the decision space due to their lack of thinking-in-space when solving deceptive multi-modal multi-objective problems, and one manifestation of the deceptiveness is that global optima are composed of unconnected small optimal solution subsets that randomly distributed in the decision space with many local optima subsets mixed among. In this study, for enabling EAs to continuously search without trapping, a solving pathway is proposed that identifies information-rich historical data and constructs structured spatial representation based on high-quality evolutionary data. Furthermore, a moderate region-oriented solution set update methodology is proposed for the detection of ultra-small optimal modalities, and two novel environmental selection and archive update mechanisms are designed. A Memory-aiding Search Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization EA, i.e., MS-MMOEA, is instantiated. The experimental results on 27 deceptive instances and a real-world problem demonstrate MS-MMOEA’s competitiveness over the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Nature-inspired methods, such as evolutionary computing and lifetime learning, have shown great promise in advancing autonomous robot design. However, the integration of evolution and learning for the joint optimization of robot morphologies and controllers remains underexplored, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the effectiveness of Lamarckian inheritance (a mechanism that allows learned traits to be encoded into the genotype and passed to offspring) in improving robot evolution in nonstationary environments. We compare a Lamarckian system with a traditional Darwinian system, where learned traits are not inherited. Using simulated modular robots in six distinct environmental setups, we analyze the fitness progression, learning ability, and parent-offspring similarity within both systems. Our results demonstrate that the Lamarckian system consistently outperforms the Darwinian system, achieving up to 33% higher fitness in the most challenging conditions. The Lamarckian system also recovers more quickly from environmental changes, showing immediate fitness gains when shifting to complex terrains, whereas the Darwinian system adapts more slowly. Real-world tests validate the robustness of the Lamarckian approach, as the top-performing robots evolved in the most challenging environment exhibit the smallest reality gap. These findings highlight the potential of Lamarckian inheritance as a powerful tool for engineering adaptive robotic systems capable of maintaining high performance in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic environments, optimization algorithms tend to track the changing optima. However, frequent changes to decision solutions often cause high switching costs and system instability. Decision solutions are expected to be robust to changes. Such problems bring new challenges to existing algorithms, i.e., solution evaluation in future environments and solution selection. Though multiple surrogate models are developed for fitness evaluation, they mainly focus on predicting absolute fitness in static environments. Thus, this paper proposes conditional-surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization (CSPSO), which adopts a conditional surrogate model to predict the relative fitness of solutions in future for robust solution selection. In CSPSO, a problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems, which are optimized by multiple swarms. Searching data of swarms is collected to learn network models for predicting the future fitness of solutions. In order to coordinate with the multi-modal, decoupled, and dynamic property of the problem, networks are conditioned on some extra information, i.e., time, subproblems, and peaks. Particularly, neural networks are first trained to predict new optimal solutions and fitness conditioned on time and subproblems, and a surrogate model is then trained to predict the relative fitness of solutions conditioned on the closest peak, corresponding subproblem, and time. By combining the current fitness with future ones, solutions with the highest fitness are selected for decision making. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on problem instances up to 1000-D in terms of solution optimality. The proposed conditional surrogate model can well predict future fitness to assist decision making.},

  abstract     = {As medical images from multiple modalities provide complementary diagnostic information, multimodal medical image classification (MMIC) leverages their integration to enhance disease diagnosis. Genetic programming (GP), especially multitree GP, offers a flexible framework for evolving multimodal features and holds the potential for interpretability—an essential factor in medical image analysis, where it is crucial to understand the underlying decision-making process. However, current multitree GP methods remain underexplored in MMIC tasks. This article attempts to fill that gap by proposing a novel multitree representation method that enables automatic multimodal feature learning and fusion from different modalities. Based on this new representation, we extend the function and terminal sets to support various types of medical imaging modalities. Additionally, a slice selection factor is proposed to process 3D medical image modalities effectively. Moreover, to fully utilize both modality-specific features and fused multimodal features, fusion is performed at both the feature and decision levels. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed on eight MMIC tasks, representing different medical scenarios. The new method is compared with 15 competitive algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method achieves better classification performance than most benchmark methods. Specifically, it achieves the highest accuracy on four out of the eight tasks, GAMMA-Binary, GAMMA-Multi, BraTS2018 and Derm7pt, with improvements of 3.38%, 2.31%, 1.36% and 4.11% respectively over the second-best method. Further analysis reveals that the evolved models show potential for interpretability, owing to their ability to effectively capture the distinctive features of each modality, which may aid in biomarker identification.},

The IVIF information excels at capturing the dynamic and ambiguous nature of user preferences. An interpretable quantitative evaluation method based on IVIF is proposed to provide reliable prior knowledge for decision-making. The novel reward functions account for both group and individual characteristics, achieving a balance in their timely responses. In order to solve the problem of mixed-integer second-order cone and semidefinite programming (MI-SOCSDP) with sparse uncertain data, an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) is developed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the consistency between the charging/discharging decision-making processes and users' fuzzy preferences. Moreover, the proposed method minimizes the worst-case expected cost over the ambiguity sets of probability distributions, effectively verifying the robustness of the model.},

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven notable progress in single image dehazing, their performance remains fundamentally constrained by the limited local receptive fields of convolutional operations, which impede the capture of global structural dependencies. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image synthesis, offering global insights into structure, texture, and color. The fuzzy prior, a probabilistic knowledge acquired through adversarial training in GANs, plays a pivotal role in robust dehazing. Motivated by this, we propose the fuzzy prior guided dehazing network (FPGDN). Our framework begins with a novel module that distills the fuzzy prior by translating an edge map into a color image, simultaneously capturing global structural, local textural, and color information. Subsequently, a dehazing network is constructed, leveraging this fuzzy prior. While the fuzzy prior captures rich color and texture features, the generated images may exhibit color shifts relative to the original scene. To remedy this, a CNN network is employed to capture local nuances and refine the dehazing outcome. Extensive experiments substantiate that the proposed FPGDN achieves superior dehazing performance on a variety of real and synthetic hazy images.},

This work presents a novel hybrid framework that enhances horizontal trajectory prediction by integrating reinforcement learning (RL)-based inference with the dynamic response of a motion model via fuzzy logic fusion. A proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent is trained to generate an angle of attack (AoA) sequence that minimizes terminal displacement error, providing task-optimal guidance based on a kinematics driven transition model. To address the absence of physical constraints and the lack of detailed dynamic modeling in the RL process, a fuzzy fusion strategy is introduced. This strategy adaptively blends the RL inferred and dynamics derived AoA according to discrepancies in motion state predictions. Experimental results from indoor trials demonstrate that the proposed method achieves endpoint localization accuracy within 0.3m. Meanwhile, the fused AoA maintains strong consistency with the measured AoA sequence, with a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence below 0.06. The proposed framework provides an adaptive and computationally efficient solution for glider localization under partial observability, highlighting the potential of fuzzy system integration in advancing data-driven autonomy for marine platforms.},

Thus, an efficient and reliable strategy is urgently needed to meet the requirements of networked marine surface vehicles' (NMSVs) formation control under this background. This paper investigates the time-varying formation control (TVFC) problem of NMSVs subject to communication links faults and model uncertainty. A hierarchical control framework is constructed for developing the prescribed-time fuzzy control (PTFC) algorithm for NMSVs, comprising a distributed formation tracking (DFT) layer and local fuzzy control (LFC) layer. The DFT layer is responsible for ensuring that all marine surface vehicle followers estimate the expected states of the virtual leader based on human-in-the-loop (HiTL) strategy. The HiTL strategy is introduced to promptly respond to unexpected emergencies in complex marine environments. Specifically, the artificially arranged control inputs are transmitted to manipulate the virtual leader through the employment of gesture-to-formation system and further guide the navigation of NMSVs followers synchronously. The LFC layer is conducted to achieve the TVFC and cope with the model uncertainty of NMSVs by using the sliding surface and fuzzy logic system. And the tracking errors of both two layers can converge to the origin within the prescribed time. Besides, the sufficient conditions of uniform convergence and stability for the closed-loop system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability. Finally, several simulation and comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed theoretical results.},

With the growing presence of uncertain event information, there is increasing demand for modeling fuzzy event knowledge in real-world applications. However, performing multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (EKGs) remains challenging due to the uncertainty and dynamic nature of events. Recent multi-hop reasoning methods based on knowledge graphs (KGs) have shown promise but often neglect event uncertainty and dynamics, limiting their effectiveness in fuzzy event reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel model, MFEGR, for multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (FEKGs), guided by soft logical rules. MFEGR explores logical connections among multi-hop paths in EKGs and discovers underlying soft rules governing them. Rule-based regularization is introduced to learn both temporal-causal dependencies between events and semantic relationships between events and their arguments. Additionally, we enhance event embeddings by incorporating fine-grained fuzziness into event elements and coarse-grained fuzziness into soft logic rules, improving reasoning robustness. We evaluate MFEGR on three fuzzy EKG datasets for event link prediction and multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results show that MFEGR consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.},

It selectively relaxes only a single boundary when the tracking error approaches critical thresholds, effectively preventing singularity issues while minimizing the performance degradation caused by the relaxation. In addition, the prescribed performance function is redesigned to enhance its performance characteristics, including the elimination of the initial feasibility condition, the capability to specify settling time, and the reduction of both transient overshoot and steady-state error.

  abstract     = {In skeleton-based gesture recognition tasks, existing approaches based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) struggle to capture the synergistic actions of nonadjacent graph nodes and the information conveyed by their long-range dependencies. Combining spatial and temporal transformers is a promising solution to address the limitation, inspired by the advantage of transformer in assessing nonadjacent long-range dependencies, but there lacks an effective strategy to integrate the spatial and temporal information extracted by these transformers. Therefore, this article proposes the spatial-temporal alternating graph convolution transformer (ST-GCN-AltFormer), which connects the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with the spatial-temporal alternating transformer (AltFormer) architecture. In the AltFormer architecture, the spatial-temporal transformer branch employs a spatial transformer to capture information from specific frames, and uses a temporal transformer to analyze its evolution over the entire temporal range. Meanwhile, the temporal-spatial transformer branch extracts temporal information from specific nodes using a temporal transformer, and integrates it with a spatial transformer. The fusion enhances accurate spatial-temporal information extraction. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracies of 97.5%, 95.8%, 94.3%, 92.8%, and 98.31% on the large-scale 3D hand gesture recognition (SHREC’17 Track), Dynamic Hand Gesture 14-28 (DHG-14/28), and leap motion dynamic hand gesture (LMDHG) dynamic gesture datasets, respectively.},

We found that highlighted areas exhibit distinct temporal characteristics compared to nonhighlighted ones, quantified using normalized saliency (NS) metrics. We found that highlights elicited immediate responses, with NS peaking quickly, but this shift came at the cost of reduced search efforts elsewhere, potentially impacting situational awareness. To predict these dynamic changes and support interface design, we developed the Highlight-Informed Saliency Model, which provides granular predictions of NS over time.

Both the base and the novel classes need to be recognized. Currently, just a few works focus on this problem, and no formal statement of the problem is provided. In this article, we provide a formal definition of the problem, and propose a method to address it. In the proposed method, adopting the strategy of fine-tuning deep learning models, a deep learning model is first learned with the base-class training instances, and then fine-tuned with resampled training instances from both the base and the novel classes. We evaluate our method with three publicly available datasets on 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot learning tasks. The results on the evaluation metric of harmonic mean of the average per-class accuracy for the base classes and that for the novel classes show that, our method could outperform state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the time and resource cost of our method is moderate.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. Unlike prior TDE methods that mainly rely on post-hoc querying or prompt selection to elicit memorized content from a fixed model, our strategy directly alters the model’s parameters to intensify its retention of the pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LLMusing DetectGPT. We subsequently fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on these membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LLMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a security mechanism against inference attacks for industrial systems where an adversary with access to the states of a (linear or nonlinear) system attempts to infer the system model using the state values. Under an inference attack, an adversary with access to the sensor measurements of the system attempts to infer the system’s parameters. The proposed security mechanism consists of two components: (i) a collection of feedback control gains, (ii) a randomized gain selection policy. To mitigate the inference attack, the gain selection policy randomly selects a feedback gain from the set of available feedback control gains at regular intervals. We cast the optimal design of the gain selection policy as an optimization problem such that (i) quadratic control cost is minimized and (ii) the uncertainty level of the adversary about selected control gain is maximized. In our formulation, the uncertainty level of the adversary about the control gain is captured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a uniform distribution and the posterior distribution of the feedback gains, given the history of the system states. We first derive the backward Bellman optimality equation for the gain selection problem and study the structural properties of the optimal gain selection policy. Our results show that the optimal gain selection policy only depends on the current state of the system, rather than the entire history of the states, which renders the optimal gain selection problem to a nonlinear Markov decision process. Next, we derive a policy gradient theorem for the gain selection problem, which provides an expression for the gradient of the objective function of the gain selection problem with respect to the parameter of a stationary (time-invariant) policy. The policy gradient theorem allows us to develop a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for computing an optimal policy. We finally demonstrate the effectiveness of our results for different linear and nonlinear systems. Our results indicate that the proposed security mechanism significantly decreases the inference ability of the adversary, while having a negligible impact on the control cost.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks have become a security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs), in which an attacker embeds a secret behavior into a DNN by poisoning a few training data. To address the backdoor threat, some defense strategies employ outlier detection algorithms to identify poisoned samples in hidden representation space. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to adaptive attacks as their representation separability assumption could be broken. In this paper, we aim to boost existing defenses by leveraging insights from the label smoothing technique, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing poison from benign samples. Our analysis uncovers the role of label smoothing as a regularization technique that enhances hidden class separability in the penultimate layer of a model. Building on the label smoothing, we introduce Learning Speed-driven Label Smoothing (LS2): a simple yet novel approach that assigns an adaptive smoothing rate based on the model’s “learning speed” for each sample. Extensive results show that LS2 can bolster the discernibility between poison and benign samples, enhancing the efficacy of defenses relying on hidden separability. Incorporated with LS2, existing hidden-separation-based defenses achieve state-of-the-art poison sample removal rates (Prm) against adaptive attacks.

  abstract     = {The advent of blockchain technology has led to the development of decentralized storage networks, revolutionizing the way data are stored and accessed and offering advantages such as cost-effective services, improved data sovereignty, and resistance to censorship. However, nodes of decentralized storage networks cannot be fully trusted and data stored in them may not be as secure and intact as claimed. Therefore, how to guarantee the storage service quality in decentralized storage networks is still a major problem to be solved. In this paper, we propose DART, a distributed zero knowledge data auditing scheme for blockchain-based decentralized storage networks, periodically authenticating both the integrity and the retrievability of data in decentralized storage networks. We design an efficient integrity auditing protocol for decentralized nodes based on distributed zero knowledge protocols, which improves the performance of auditing whilst maintaining low cost with zero knowledge protocols. Furthermore, we introduce the erasure code in decentralized storage networks to support data retrievability across decentralized nodes. By leveraging accumulator techniques to design a dual accumulation strategy, we build a batch verification approach to improve the communication and computation efficiency in data retrieval checking. We analyze the security of DART under the random oracle model and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Experimental results affirm that DART outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in decentralized storage networks, reducing the overhead in both the storage and verification phases by more than 70%. Moreover, this performance advantage becomes increasingly pronounced with larger file sizes, underscoring the scalability and practicality of DART.},

  abstract     = {Passwords remain one of the most widely used forms of authentication in modern systems. However, their inherent predictability, stemming from common user behaviors in password creation, renders password-based authentication vulnerable to guessing attacks. To balance memorability and security, users often construct isomorphic variants of a base password by altering its structure, such as transforming 123abc into 1a2b3c. These variants pose significant challenges to traditional password guessing models. In particular, mainstream approaches such as Markov model and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) model struggle to capture the structural relationships among these variants. To address this challenge, we propose PassGIN, a password guessing framework based on Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By modeling a password as a graph, PassGIN captures both local adjacency and character rearrangement patterns, enabling the model to distinguish subtle structural differences between base passwords and their isomorphic variants. To further enhance performance, we introduce PassCluster, a dynamic edge-weighting mechanism that leverages adjacency frequencies observed in large-scale password datasets. This allows GIN to more effectively learn structural variations and generate accurate guesses. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that PassGIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both intra-site and cross-site password guessing scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 23.49% and 74.53%, respectively.},

To increase the scalability of TOR, researchers mainly utilize hop-by-hop routing during circuit extension. However, hop-by-hop routing has not been widely deployed since it suffers from route capture attacks, and most of the countermeasures require the source participate in the route extension indirectly, help verify the selection of next hop by intermediate nodes, thus introduces communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing scheme called Jump Routing. In jump routing, the route extension follows the jumping way, that each relay chooses the successor of the next hop rather than the next hop itself. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to route in the jumping way. In addition, to defend route capture attacks, enhance data privacy, and defend collusion attacks, we propose multiple schemes including jump verification, jump encryption, and corporative jump verification. Different from previous measures on route capture attacks, jump routing does not need the participation of the source, but deals with the attack by intermediate nodes only. We manage to realize the full jump routing prototype, and the evaluation results show that our jump routing is scalable, lightweight, and resilient.},

Considering that semantic coding is a natural protection layer, a double-layer semantic encryption method is proposed, which can improve the encryption effects in severe information leakage scenarios. The experimental results show MHSCS increases legitimate receivers’ image recovery performance by up to 18.60% under strong multipath effects compared to baselines’ optimal performance and prevents up to 81.87% of privacy leakage in severe leakage scenarios.},

While current research has predominantly focused on data source analysis for identifying known attack patterns or anomalous behaviors, three critical challenges remain inadequately addressed: 1) APTs demonstrate sophisticated concealment capabilities, embedding malicious operations within legitimate business activities; 2) The sparse nature of APT attacks leads to low-frequency malicious activities that prove exceptionally challenging to detect within massive log datasets; 3) APTs employ multi-stage attack chains, whereas existing solutions exhibit limitations in reconstructing complete attack pathways to enable effective forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the detrimental effects of the sparsity of malevolent interactions and attack intent camouflaging on anomaly detection by introducing SAURONEYES, the pioneering APT detection system tailored to resolve these challenges. SAURONEYES constructs audit logs into both knowledge and interaction views, disentangling these to learn representations through graph learning enhanced with an attention-based neighbor allocation mechanism. Additionally, we incorporate self-supervised contrastive learning to discern the subtle similarities and distinctions among disentangled samples, facilitating a deeper understanding of the inherent structures within system interactions. SAURONEYES thus boasts heightened sensitivity and granular detection capabilities. Finally, SAURONEYES reconstructs the attack chain at the node level and presents an attack-chain that is more accessible for security analysis. Our evaluations in real-world scenarios and simulated attack environments demonstrate that SAURONEYES achieves outstanding accuracy, with an average detection rate of 99% and a false positive rate below 0.1%.},

However, its design does not include protections against attacks exploiting intermediate data leakage. Since Ravi and Bruinderink introduced schemes to forge Dilithium signatures, numerous works have leveraged power analysis attack to exploit vulnerabilities in Dilithium implementations. In this paper, we revisit previous attacks and identify promising optimization strategies for hints-oriented attacks. In such attacks, an adversary first utilizes side-channel leakage to derive hint equations related to the secret key and then solves for the secret key using these equations. Our new strategy enables each signature to generate more valid hint equations, significantly reducing the number of required signatures for a successful attack. By incorporating machine learning techniques, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we can efficiently detect hint equations with high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining a lattice-based algorithm with hybrid filtering methods, our scheme can further reduce the required number of hint equations. Additionally, our attack method is applicable to Dilithium security levels 2, 3, and 5. For Dilithium-2, the proposed attack successfully recovers the complete secret key even under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions, requiring 395, 330, and 305 signatures at SNRs of 0.0167, 0.0210, and 0.0406, respectively.},

In order to reduce user overhead, the data owner stores the location information and text data on the cloud server, and the user completes the retrieval task with the help of the fog server. To protect the privacy of outsourced data, many secure spatial keyword retrieval schemes have been proposed. Most schemes use R-tree indexes to improve the efficiency of ciphertext retrieval, but the encrypted R-tree index is hard to update. Moreover, some indexes based on order-preserving encryption are vulnerable to frequency-revealing attacks. So how to balance efficiency and security is a problem. To solve the above problems, we propose an efficient and secure spatial keyword ciphertext retrieval scheme based on cloud-fog collaboration. First, we innovatively design the SK-tree. The Geohash algorithm and Simhash algorithm are used in SK-tree to compress information, achieving efficient retrieval. Secondly, our retrieval tree has the function of fuzzy order preservation, which can better hide the correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext compared to traditional index-based order-preserving encryption schemes. In addition, we design a cloud-fog-user interaction scheme for attribute-based encryption that can hide access control policies, which reduces the computational overhead for the user side. Finally, we prove through theoretical analysis that our scheme ensures cloud data security and query trap information privacy.

  abstract     = {Automated Program Repair (APR) repairs software bugs based on buggy code snippets automatically. It is instrumental in reducing the time and effort required for software maintenance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized for APR and demonstrated promising results. Existing APR approaches adopt an LLM learning paradigm of either prompt engineering or fine-tuning to perform APR tasks. However, these prompt-based approaches underutilize the extensive high-quality bug-fix datasets available in the APR community, missing out on valuable repair knowledge. Conversely, fine-tuning-based APRs rely on LLMs to autonomously understand the entire complex APR tasks without the benefit of natural language guidance through a prompt. Additionally, the crucial bug information the bug-triggering test suites provided remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while existing APRs focus only on repair effectiveness, they neglect the patch ranking effectiveness that also matters in real-world program repair scenarios. To address the above limitations, we propose InstructRepair, an innovative APR framework that integrates self-supervised instruction tuning with rich bug information to guide LLMs in generating high-quality patches. InstructRepair instructs APR tasks through detailed instructions and enhances repair performance by training LLMs over the first instructional APR dataset we construct. InstructRepair also extracts rich bug information (e.g., buggy line, bug’s context, bug’s diagnostics, test suites and meta-information) to provide fix-relevant tokens and insights into the root causes of bugs for LLMs during both instruction tuning and the repairing process. The human domain knowledge initiated instruction template that integrates this bug information is refined through prompt tuning, which learns task-specific knowledge and unleashes the hidden power stored in pre-trained LLMs automatically. We evaluate InstructRepair on the widely adopted Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks with Java programming language, demonstrating that our work outperforms seven state-of-the-art APR approaches by successfully fixing a total of 122 bugs (10 more than the best baseline) and repairing 19 unique bugs that previous work cannot. In terms of patch ranking effectiveness, InstructRepair also achieves the best performance with a fixing rate of 95.9% (60.0% as the best baseline). The ablation study further validates the contributions of each component to overall repairing performance. We also apply InstructRepair to the Python programming language and beat four state-of-the-art APR approaches, which demonstrates our method’s cross-language generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {Authentication in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted communication systems is a critical issue due to the unique characteristics of RIS, such as its passive nature, lack of built-in security mechanisms, and susceptibility to spoofing and relay attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a new physical layer authentication scheme that leverages the channel characteristics of cascaded channels in RIS-assisted systems. Specifically, we model the cascaded communication channel in the RIS-assisted communication system as an equivalent point-to-point Nakagami fading channel. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of physical layer authentication (PLA) as a binary hypothesis testing problem. To facilitate this, we employ the energy measurement of the received signal as the test statistic to achieve detecting the legality of the transmitter identity. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the false alarm probability and detection probability for single-channel and multi-channel scenarios to evaluate authentication performance, using statistical signal processing theory. Finally, we conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed authentication scheme.},

  abstract     = {With the growing complexity and diversity of network attacks, single defense methods are no longer sufficient to meet modern cybersecurity needs, necessitating comprehensive measures to manage the entire attack-defense landscape. Situational awareness systems address this by analyzing multi-source information to assess security postures and predict trends. Traditional methods suffer from low prediction accuracy due to data imbalance, reliance on expert experience, and information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deep neural network-based model for cybersecurity situational awareness. The model first extracts situational elements using a variational self-encoder with an integration strategy, trained on normal data and optimized with random weight averaging to enhance robustness and identify anomalies. It then assesses the security posture by extracting features from heterogeneous data with a neural network and applying an attention-based feature fusion method, combined with one-dimensional convolutional neural networks to reduce reliance on expert knowledge. Finally, the model predicts the security posture using a sample convolution and interaction unit, capturing temporal dependencies while mitigating information loss with a cross-channel module. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in addressing key challenges in cybersecurity situational awareness, with a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for defending against presentation attacks in complex attack types and high-security scenarios. However, existing multi-modal FAS methods encounter two main limitations: (1) Most methods rely on classification supervision, which often fails to fully capture the distinctions between real faces and presentation attacks (PAs). (2) These methods depend solely on source domain data with limited PA types, leading to significant performance degradation when encountering unseen PA types and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion framework called Fine-grained Textual Guidance Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing (FTG-FAS), which aligns natural language descriptions with multi-modal fused features to guide learning. Specifically, we propose a textual-guided token dropout module to select semantic invariant patch tokens for multi-modal fusion, thereby enhancing the model’s generalization capability. In the testing phase, we propose FTG-FAS++, which leverages a self-distillation scheme with online source-free adaptation to further enhance model’s performance in unseen scenarios. Specifically, we establish a teacher-student distillation framework, where the teacher model is fed with the complete image while the student model only receives masked tokens. During adaptation, we minimize the prediction discrepancy between the teacher and student in a unidirectional manner. Meanwhile, we propose a class-balanced sample selection strategy for stable source-free adaptation to prevent the model from overfitting to either real or spoof during the tuning process. Experiments show that FTG-FAS and FTG-FAS++ outperform SOTA methods by 6.91% and 8.72% in AUC on the cross-dataset leave-one-out protocols.

  abstract     = {Reconstruction attackers can exploit facial features to recover the original user’s face, resulting in user privacy leakage. One new strategy to enhance the “Edge-Cloud” face recognition system’s privacy is to add adversarial perturbations to facial features, preventing the attackers from high-quality user image recovery. However, the existing works following this strategy suffer from unacceptable damage to face recognition accuracy. Achieving robust privacy enhancement and face recognition accuracy simultaneously is still challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose an adversarial perturbation-based plug-and-play privacy-enhancing method (Patronus) with robustness against face image reconstruction attacks and near-lossless face recognition performance. The key insight is derived from our observation that the feature distance between two face images of the same person is significantly lower than the threshold set in the face recognition system. This leaves room for adding adversarial perturbations to the facial features without compromising face recognition accuracy. Our strategy limits the amount of adversarial perturbations in a fine-grained manner to ensure that they are within the range of not damaging face recognition accuracy. Our evaluation shows the superior performance of Patronus in robustness against reconstruction attacks and near-lossless face recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Patronus can be easily integrated into deployed face recognition systems as a plug-in privacy-enhancing module with low overhead.},

  abstract     = {Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at the automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Compared to mask or auxiliary visual features, skeletal features provide a more accurate representation during athletic movements. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results. In addition, we introduce a newly-annotated FineDiving-Pose Dataset to improve the current low-quality human pose labels. In experiments, the results on FineDiving and MTL-AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Spike camera is a neuromorphic sensor that can capture high-speed dynamic scenes by firing a continuous stream of binary spikes with extremely high temporal resolution, essentially forming a dense sampling in the temporal dimension. Due to the relative motion between camera and scene, each pixel is actually sampling at a large number of different spatial positions on the object in a short period. Converting this dense sampling from temporal dimension to spatial domain, high resolution images can be reconstructed from the spike stream. However, spike fluctuations and large motion in high-speed scenes pose great challenges for this task, especially for intensity information extraction and temporal alignment. In this paper, we propose a spike camera super resolution network to address these issues. Considering the local temporal correlation of spike stream and correlation consistency within a local region, we introduce a representation module that performs region-adaptive temporal filtering on spikes to mitigate fluctuations and extract stable intensity information from binary data. Additionally, we develop a module for multi-frame feature alignment, leveraging the long-term temporal information of spike stream. To handle large motions, we propagate the motion information from neighboring moment to current feature alignment module, which provides a prior that helps to narrow the search range for current motion offset, improving the accuracy of temporal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-captured spike data.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration, which estimates a rigid transformation matrix between two point clouds, is a fundamental process in numerous applications. While existing detector-free techniques present exceptional performance, they overlook the extraction of hybrid local features that capture correlations between points and their neighbours, thereby limiting the quality of point cloud recognition. Moreover, these approaches typically treat point clouds as sequential data and employ the transformer to integrate global context from all points, which inevitably introduces interference from irrelevant regions, hence affecting the registration accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel detector-free approach AGHL to address these challenges. For the first issue, AGHL introduces a hybrid local feature perception module that designs two parallel branches to concurrently extract low-level and high-level local features, which effectively encode the correlations between each point and its neighborhood points in both Euclidean space and high-dimensional feature space. For the second issue, AGHL develops an anchor-guided cross attention that adheres to the local geometric consistency to constrain the network’s attention on reliable anchors, thereby effectively suppressing interference from irrelevant regions. Benefiting from these techniques, AGHL achieves impressive point cloud registration accuracy across all synthetic, indoor, and outdoor datasets. Furthermore, we build an experimental platform and conduct a real-world robot localization experiment, with results showing the strong generalization ability of AGHL.},

  abstract     = {Hashing is an effective technique for large-scale image retrieval. However, traditional hashing models typically follow a closed-set assumption, which fails to satisfy the practicality of real-world tasks. In this paper, we explore a meaningful yet overlooked question: is there a hashing paradigm that not only supports rehearsal-free online incremental coding for single-pass data streams but also adapts to potentially expanding concept spaces in open environments? Instead of presetting fixed bit lengths, we suggest adjusting the bit length dynamically based on the number of encountered categories, meanwhile enabling bit extension of existing hash codes to match the adaptive code lengths without knowledge forgetting. Therefore, we propose a Bit-extendable IncremenTal haShing (BITS) method for image retrieval in open environments. Specifically, we identify a blurry incremental setup to better simulate realistic scenarios, revisiting the widely-used data-incremental and class-incremental settings. With this challenging setup, a three-phase framework is designed to efficiently perform incremental hashing, which jointly solves online continual coding and bit extension with adaptive code lengths. Through the well-designed hashing paradigm, BITS achieves comparable performance to offline hashing methods while significantly saving computational resources. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our BITS in dynamic scenarios. The source code is available at https://github.com/yxinwang/BITS.},

However, OM-RRW embeds watermarks into visually sensitive global low-frequency features, which easily leads to ring-like distortions that expose watermark locations, making them vulnerable to removal through image inpainting. To address this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to introduce an innovative strategy to eliminate these visible distortions, thereby overcoming OM-RRW’s inherent limitations. The strategy innovates on two fronts: first, it customizes varying embedding step sizes based on the stability differences of moment values to minimize distortion; second, it designs a texture-aware adaptive basis function fine-tuning strategy. This strategy adjusts the representation capability of the basis functions in different regions based on the human eye’s sensitivity to various texture areas, helping to avoid visible ring-like distortions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using Polar Harmonic Transform (PHT) moments, comprising three moments that exhibit remarkable performance in existing OM-RRW methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can embed 128-bit watermarks with no visible distortions while minimizing the loss of robustness. In addition, this paper finds that OM-RRW demonstrates satisfactory robustness against VAE watermark removal attacks.},

In this paper, we explore active learning for vision-based 3DOD for the first time. Inspired by the entropy analysis, we involve three concerns to characterize the sample informativeness: sample diversity in input space, feature informativeness in BEV space, and result distribution in prediction space. Based on these concerns, we propose a novel AL framework named HMAD, which utilizes Height Modeling and Adaptive Diversity-based sampling for comprehensive informativeness characterization. In HMAD, we first propose a novel height-guided adversarial module in BEV space, which measures the informativeness of height modeling for 2D-to-3D mapping in an adversarial manner. Furthermore, Budget-aware SpatioTemporal diversity Sampling (BSTS) and Class Balance Sampling (CBS) are proposed to adaptively measure the sample informativeness in input and prediction space, respectively. Finally, the three components are integrated into a two-stage sampling strategy, with which the most informative samples can be selected and annotated for the next iteration. Experiments evidence that HMAD achieves comparable performances by only using 50% annotated training data, and can generalize well on different conditions.},

Furthermore, most existing semi-supervised methods place limited emphasis on leveraging the data distribution. To address those challenges, we propose a Semi-Supervised SAR-to-Optical Image Translation (S3OIL) method that achieves high-quality image generation using minimal paired data and extensive unpaired data while strategically exploiting the data distribution. To this end, we first introduce a Cross-Set Alignment Matching (CAM) mechanism to create local correspondences between the generated results of paired and unpaired data, ensuring cross-set consistency. In addition, for unpaired data, we apply weak and strong perturbations and establish intra-set Multi-Scale Matching (MSM) constraints. For paired data, intra-modal semantic consistency (ISC) is presented to ensure alignment with the ground truth. Finally, we propose local and global cross-modal semantic consistency (CSC) to boost structural identity during translation. We conduct extensive experiments on SAR-to-optical datasets and another sketch-to-anime task, demonstrating that S3OIL delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Ablation studies further reveal that S3OIL can ensure the preservation of both semantic content and structural integrity of the generated images.

  abstract     = {The α-tree is an effective hierarchical image representation used for connected filtering or segmentation in remote sensing and other image applications. The α-tree constructs a tree based on the dissimilarities of the pixels in an image. Compared to other hierarchical image representations such as the component tree, the α-tree provides a better representation of the granularity of images and is easier to apply to multichannel images. The major drawback of the α-tree is its processing speed, due to the large amount of data to be processed and the lack of studies on an efficient algorithms, especially on multichannel and high dynamic range images. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptation of the hybrid component tree algorithm on the α-tree for fast parallel α-tree construction in any dynamic range of pixel dissimilarity. We tested the hybrid α-tree algorithm on Sentinel-2 remote sensing images from the European Space Agency (ESA) as well as randomly generated images, on the Hábrók high performance computing cluster. Experimental results show that the hybrid α-tree algorithm achieves the processing speed of 10–30Mpix/s and the speedup of 10–30 on a 128-core computer, proving the efficiency of the first parallel α-tree algorithm in high dynamic range, to the best of our knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Palmprint recognition offers a promising solution for convenient and private authentication. However, the scarcity of large-scale palmprint datasets constrains its development and application. Recent approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by synthesizing palmprints based on Bézier curves. Due to the lack of paired data between curves and palmprints, it is difficult to generate curve-driven palmprints with precise identity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Pixel and Feature Identity Guidance (PFIG) framework to synthesize realistic palmprints, whose IDs are strictly governed by the Bézier curves. In order to establish ID mapping, an ID Injection (IDI) module is constructed to synthesize pseudo-paired data. Two cross-domain ID consistency losses at pixel and feature levels are further proposed to strictly preserve the semantic information of the input ID curves. Experimental results demonstrate that our ID-guided approach can synthesize more realistic palmprints with controllable identities. Based on only 80,000 synthesized palmprints for pre-training, the recognition accuracy can be improved by more than 18% in terms of TAR@1e-6. When trained exclusively on synthetic data, our method achieves superior performance to existing synthetic approaches. The source code is available at https://github.com/YuchenZou/PFIG-Palm.},

We propose a sparse-to-dense stereo matching (SDSM) method to solve the challenging problem of line clustering and line matching. We design the structured light line pattern with four colors and the distances between lines of different color range from sparse to dense. Accordingly, the sparse color lines could be clustered and matched at first while the dense color lines could be matched subsequently with the constraint of the clustered and matched sparse color lines. After all the color lines are matched, a spline-function based parallax model (SFPM) is computed based on the points on the matched color lines. Then, the depths of the points in the regions between the color lines are computed by the parallax model. Experimental results show that the proposed SDSM-SFPM ASV approach is more robust than existing methods especially in reconstructing the complex 3D shapes.},

  abstract     = {Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to solve the problem of incrementally learning new classes from a non-i.i.d. and single-pass data stream. Compared to the offline setting, OCIL is much closer to a live learning experience requiring higher model update frequency at less computational budget. Due to its one-epoch training constraint, the model is likely to learn non-essential features and encounter the under-fitting issue, which severely affects the model’s stability. In this paper, we investigate how to use hard samples to improve data variability, eventually enhancing feature learning and addressing the under-fitting problem. Specifically, by introducing a scoring function assessing the sample value, we build an OCIL formulation that simultaneously generates high-value samples and optimizes the OCIL model, improving generalization ability within the constraint of single-epoch training. Empirically, we found that strong data augmentation is a simple but effective way to generate a higher proportion of high-score samples. To make the most of these augmented samples, we design an OCIL model based on mutual learning with two networks of identical structures. Moreover, a collaborative learning mechanism is developed by aligning the features and class probabilities from the two networks to promote their interaction. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets for OCIL have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, obtaining superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods generally suffer from inaccurate motion estimation and motion compensation (MEMC) problems for large motions. Inspired by recent progress in physics-informed neural networks, we model the challenges of MEMC in STVSR as a mapping between two continuous function spaces. Specifically, our approach transforms independent low-resolution representations in the coarse-grained continuous function space into refined representations with enriched spatiotemporal details in the fine-grained continuous function space. To achieve efficient and accurate MEMC, we design a Galerkin-type attention function to perform frame alignment and temporal interpolation. Due to the linear complexity of the Galerkin-type attention mechanism, our model avoids patch partitioning and offers global receptive fields, enabling precise estimation of large motions. The experimental results show that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in both fixed-size and continuous space-time video super-resolution tasks.

RSC codes are commonly used as component codes for various concatenated schemes, including the popular Turbo codes. Efficient interleaver design is crucial in improving the error-correcting performance of Turbo codes; therefore, understanding the low-weight input patterns specific to the selected RSC code is essential. Existing graph-based search algorithms face increasing complexity as the constraint length of the RSC code increases. To address this issue, we introduce a method that directly derives the critical low-weight input patterns (up to Hamming weight 4) from the generator function of the RSC code. The proposed method addresses the complexity issue and can be extended to non-recursive systematic convolutional (NRSC) codes by modifying the generator function. To validate our novel method, we compare the union bound obtained using our approach to that obtained via the transfer function method and the simulation results for selected RSC codes. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, which shows no significant counting losses.},

Quadratic permutations, which have the lowest depth, have been widely used in prior designs. In this paper, we propose a construction method that can give new quadratic permutations over Fpm, and cryptographic properties such as differential uniformity and Walsh spectrum of these permutations are also characterized. We give sufficient conditions for permutations over Fpn to attain a differential uniformity of pn−1 for n ≥ 3. Furthermore, it is proven that for these permutations, the maximal 2-norm of Walsh coefficients remains bounded by pn−1, provided either the last n − 1 entries of the input mask or the last n − 1 entries of the output mask form a nonzero vector. As an application, we design a new FHE-friendly stream cipher named YuS based on a new quadratic permutation over Fp3 and a fixed linear mapping. According to our implementation, achieves YuS faster evaluation times and higher throughput compared to Masta, Pasta, Pastav2 and HERA in almost all instances for both BGV and BFV schemes at 80-bit and 128-bit security levels.},

Conditions for uniqueness of reconstruction of signals that are sparse with respect to dictionaries or, more generally, to non-linear locally Lipschitz mappings are obtained as special cases. Furthermore, we show that a frame multiplier matrix is full superregular, i.e., that all its minors are nonzero, for almost all frame symbol vectors, provided that the underlying frames are full spark and sufficiently redundant. Since Gabor frames are full spark for almost all windows, we study Gabor multipliers in more detail and are able to derive improved constants for some scenarios. Finally, our simulation results reveal that, in many instances, subsampled frame multiplier matrices exhibit the same ℓ1-reconstruction performance as i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices.},

PCR leverages the i.i.d-ness property of the observations to obtain high-resolution p-values with a very small number of conditional randomizations. We also provide a power analysis of the PCR test, which captures the effect of various parameters of the test, the sample size and the distance of the alternative from the set of null distributions, measured in terms of a notion called ‘conditional relative density’. In addition, we propose two extensions of the PCR test, with important practical implications: (i) parameter-free PCR, which uses Bonferroni’s correction to decide on a tuning parameter in the test; (ii) robust PCR, which avoids inflations in the size of the test when there is slight error in estimating the conditional law PX|Z.},

Despite of the fact that there have been numerous encoding and decoding algorithms in the literature, most of them are not quasi-linear time algorithms for arbitrary order Reed-Muller codes. Under the decoding framework proposed by Pellikaan and Wu (IEEE TIT, 2004) which regards Reed-Muller codes as subfield subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes, we propose a new decoding algorithm for Reed-Muller codes that improves previous polynomial decoding complexity to quasilinear complexity. Our new decoding algorithm includes multivariate multipoint evaluation (MPE) and interpolation under a new basis of the multivariate polynomial space as two main steps. We show that the MPE and interpolation at certain multipoint sets can be performed in quasi-linear time as well. Our approach is based on a well-known transform between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials. We make use of the key fact that the transformation matrix between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials is sparse. Due to sparsity, MPE and interpolation of multivariate polynomials and decoding of Reed-Muller codes can be reduced to MPE and interpolation of univariate polynomials and decoding of Reed-Solomon codes without extra cost respectively, i.e, the complexity of MPE and interpolation of multivariate polynomials (and, respectively, decoding of Reed-Muller codes) is dominated by that of MPE and interpolation of univariate polynomials (and, respectively, decoding of Reed-Solomon codes). As a result of this reduction, we obtain our quasi-linear time algorithms.},

Two important scenarios are analyzed: (i) tradeoff between decoding deadline Δ and probability of error pe assuming infinite memory α = ∞; and (ii) tradeoff between α and pe assuming infinite Δ = ∞. For each scenario, this work derives the corresponding asymptotic constant ρ, power β and decay rate η that satisfy pe(x) ∼ ρxβe−ηx. The results of (i) and (ii) are then used to study an important code design problem: Under a given target deadline Δ, what is the memory length α needed for the error probability pe to be within a factor of c > 1 of the best possible p∗ e over α. Further analysis also suggests that regardless the c value being considered, the necessary memory length is approximately 3–7% of the target deadline Δ when Δ is large, the actual percentage depending on the channel model and the coding rate.

  abstract     = {The emerging problem of joint community detection and group synchronization, with applications in signal processing and machine learning, has been extensively studied in recent years. Previous research on this topic has focused predominantly on a statistical model that extends the stochastic block model (SBM) by incorporating additional group transformations. In its simplest form, a random network of size n is generated with two communities of equal size, where each node i is associated with a group element g∗ i ∈ GM for some finite group GM of order M. The nodes are connected with probability p if they are in the same community, and q otherwise. In addition, a group transformation gij is observed at each edge, where gij = g∗ i (g∗ j )−1 if the nodes i and j are in the same community, and gij ∼ Unif(GM) otherwise. The goal is to recover both the underlying communities and group elements. When p = a log n/n and q = b log n/n with a, b > 0, we establish the sharp information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery: (i) : a + b/2 − √ab/M > 1 and (ii) : a > 2 where exact recovery of communities is possible only if (i) is satisfied, and recovery of group elements is achieved only if both (i) and (ii) hold. Our theory indicates the recovery of communities greatly benefits from the group elements, and demonstrates a significant performance gap between the information limit and existing approaches.},

A classic result on these functions, called the Leftover Hash Lemma, gives an estimate of the distance from uniformity based on the assumptions about the min-entropy of the source. We prove several results concerning extensions of this lemma to a class of functions that are k*-universal, i.e., l-universal for all 2 ≤ l ≤ k. As a common distinctive feature, our results provide estimates of closeness to uniformity in terms of the α-Rényi divergence for all α ∈ (1, ∞]. For 1 ≤ α ≤ k we show that it is possible to convert all the randomness of the source measured in α-Rényi entropy into approximately uniform bits with nearly the same amount of randomness. For large enough k we show that it is possible to distill random bits that are nearly uniform, as measured by min-entropy. We also extend these results to hashing with side information.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as a promising approach to improving fuel efficiency, safety, and traffic flow. However, achieving robust and efficient control in heterogeneous CAV platoons remains challenging, especially under uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based platoon controllers often ignore model uncertainties or rely on centralized training, limiting their scalability and robustness in real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a fully distributed, model-free RL framework integrated with a robust compensator for optimal platoon control of heterogeneous vehicles with unknown dynamics. The RL agent simultaneously learns the optimal control policy and estimates control-relevant dynamic parameters using only local input-output data, without requiring explicit vehicle models. These estimates are then used in real time to construct a disturbance-rejection input that ensures robust trajectory tracking. A distributed observer based on consensus theory is embedded within the hybrid controller to estimate leader-relative reference trajectories using only local neighbor information, eliminating the need for global communication. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence and bounded tracking errors under dynamic uncertainties. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulation (MiTaS) platform, combining the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with MATLAB, demonstrating improved tracking, damping of traffic oscillations, and up to 15.8% fuel savings compared to recent RL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The trajectories of pedestrian movements involve uncertainty, requiring a predictive probability model capable of modeling the underlying multimodality. To predict the trajectory of pedestrian, most existing methods try to learn the probability distribution of real pedestrian trajectories and then independently sample multiple times from this distribution to obtain a set of possible future paths. However, naively learning the distribution of real-world trajectories leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we design a model-agnostic reinforcement learning-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. This framework models pedestrian trajectory generation as a denoising process, which is further formulated as a multi-step decision-making process. In our framework, we subtly design a reward function, which is used to optimize the diffusion model with policy-based reinforcement learning. We make evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including ETH/UCY and SDD datasets, where our approach achieves promising results.

  abstract     = {Detection and repair of pavement distress in time are crucial to maximize functional performance and service life, while minimizing maintenance costs on extensive roadway networks. Manual distress detection is labor intensive and error prone. While deep learning techniques offer unparalleled capabilities for automated and accurate pixel-level pavement distress segmentation, their reliance on extensive manual annotations remains a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose an open-ended self-supervised framework enabling flexible integration of various pretext tasks for pavement distress segmentation without manual annotations. We introduce a spatial contexts-informed pretext task that automatically generates pseudo labels by leveraging the highly consistent semantic information inherent across continuous pavement images within localized areas. Amulti-line parallel network architecture is then employed, where each line extracts a distinct deep representation aligned with the pseudo-label generation process. These representations are jointly optimized through a shared weight update scheme augmented by momentum encoders to capture long-range dependencies. Avision transformer processes the input images during inference, utilizing self-attention to highlight distressed regions based on the learned representations for precise segmentation. Extensive evaluations validate the performance of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by 0.075 mIoU on average, while remarkably surpassing weakly supervised techniques requiring manual image-level annotations. These results are far more promising given that our self-supervised approach avoids human labeling costs, striking a trade-off between model effectiveness and annotation efficiency for large-scale deployments. It helps transportation agencies to realize timely, proactive infrastructure maintenance through scalable, accurate distress monitoring over extensive road networks.},

Building on this neural network approximation under FDI attacks, a novel state observer is developed to estimate the vehicle’s state, restore the communication protocol when the communication link is attacked, and address the complex coupling issues between vehicle states. Furthermore, finite-time prescribed performance control inputs are designed based on the constructed sliding surfaces to ensure practical finite-time stability of the 2-D plane vehicle platoon. This method facilitates vehicle multi-lane fusion within a finite time while guaranteeing platoon performance and preventing collisions.

To address the complexities of data integration, we propose a Binarized Digital Image Pixels Mask (BDIPM) method integrated with a backstepping control framework. The BDIPM method enhances useful visual pixels while filtering out irrelevant signals, enabling the scalarization of high-dimensional image data into a format suitable for control design with rigorous analysis footing. By constructing an error model that maps image-derived features to real-state variables, we establish a sensory pixel-based feedback control law. CARLA results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Previous methods predominantly concentrate on optimizing passage strategies for individual intersections in isolation.

In this work, we propose a method that aims to optimize the passing order of intersections from a global and long-term perspective to enhance overall transportation efficiency. Specifically, we model the coordination of multiple unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent sequential decision problem and solve it through a two-stage method. In the planning stage, we construct fully connected undirected graphs based on vehicle conflict relationships and use the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to learn the global priorities. In the scheduling stage, the local vehicle scheduling is formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem. The learned global priorities are soft constraints, while a hybrid filtered beam search determines safe and efficient CAV passing orders. Extensive offline experiments and online tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in minimizing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency.},

The realization of VCC relies on the proper deployment and application of intelligent infrastructures, such as Roadside Units (RSUs) for communication and Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) for computation. However, the time-varying mobility characteristics of individual vehicles and uncertain service demands pose challenges for effective infrastructure deployment. This paper proposes a two-stage deployment optimization model based on real vehicle trajectory data to enhance the connected vehicles-RSUs-ECSs chain for information propagation and task offloading. In the first stage, a hybrid communication networking model is developed to design an information propagation tree, leading to a tri-objective optimization problem for RSU deployment, solved using NSGA-II to generate Pareto frontier solutions. The second stage focuses on ECS deployment through a bi-objective optimization model, incorporating chance-constrained planning to handle variability of RSU computation demand caused by dynamic vehicle distributions. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method is applied for hierarchical optimization, and an enhanced tabu search (ETS) algorithm is employed to efficiently determine optimal solutions. Subsequently, an online task reallocation and relaying mechanism based on sequential decision-making is developed to enhance system resilience under extreme scenarios. Validation on the Anhui Xuancheng dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves communication service capacity and balances computational loads. This research contributes to the continuous and optimal deployment of smart infrastructures to advance the application of ITS for sustainable urban mobility.},

This leads to critical object data being obscured by excessive background information during data fusion, complicating effective integration. Additionally, efficiently leveraging historical perception data remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free motion attribute extraction module that captures motion features between consecutive frames, enabling more efficient utilization of historical information to enhance current perception. Specifically, we design two temporal modules to comprehensively explore both ego and collaborators’ historical information. Furthermore, we propose a method that simultaneously considers the relationships between global appearance features and local motion features of shared information, thereby enabling better integration of foreground object data during collaboration. We validate our algorithm through experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world collaborative benchmarks.

In this context, the concept of Vehicular Sensing in the Dark (DarkSensing) is introduced as the use of sensing technologies and algorithms to enable vehicles to perceive, communicate and navigate under dark conditions. It encompasses both individual sensor capabilities and cooperative sensing strategies across all vehicle automation levels. This survey provides the first comprehensive and structured overview of DarkSensing in ITS, focusing on five perception sensor modalities: cameras, LiDAR, RADAR, thermal sensors, and event-based sensors. Specifically, the survey systematically examines the challenges and recent advancements in sensor hardware, perception algorithms, data enhancement methods, and collaborative sensing frameworks. Furthermore, we highlight critical open issues with case studies and outline future research directions. This work establishes the conceptual foundation for DarkSensing and aims to guide researchers and practitioners toward robust ITS performance in dark conditions.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of vulnerable targets in urban road surveillance videos is crucial in intelligent transportation systems widely used in urban roads. Since the features of vulnerable targets conflict, it is difficult for the target detection algorithm to use the complete target features fully. Therefore, it is imperative to fully mine the features of the feature conflict targets for the detector design. Although there have been methods to enhance the integrity of target features based on target edge features, the edge’s ability to emphasize the target’s internal regions is limited, and there is no guarantee that the emphasized features must be internal features of the target. To this end, we propose DEGNet, which emphasizes the internal features of the target by diffusion and superposition of the target edge in the eight neighborhoods and designs DEAM to guide the target detection network to pay more attention to the internal features of the target from the feature level. In addition, we propose CS-NMS, which adaptively adjusts the degree of influence of the category on the screening of detection boxes. We constructed an urban road vulnerable target detection dataset SC8D with feature conflict scenes and tested the performance of the proposed method in this dataset and real-world scenarios. The results show that our method outperforms existing methods and can effectively apply to fragile object detection in feature conflict scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate and trustworthy models of legal concepts and restrictions for navigating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today’s logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent’s state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent’s state space. Extending prior work on ProMis’ reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.},

We introduce a framework that blends quantum-resilient cryptographic primitives with a sharded blockchain architecture. Each shard maintains a local ledger for its vehicle group, enabling real-time transactions and efficient certificate management without overloading any single chain. A lightweight global chain periodically anchors all shards, preserving system-wide consistency and blocking malicious revocations. Vehicles register or revoke PQ credentials via a lightweight Proof-of-Stake consensus, while roadside units (RSUs) handle signature verification to offload on-board computation. We further demonstrate practicality through a federated-learning case study in which vehicles exchange signed model updates over the same secure channel. SUMO/TraCI simulations with 2 000 vehicles and 10 shards show that despite PQ overhead the system sustains near real-time delays and high throughput. The framework thus offers a decentralized, quantum-resilient solution for secure Vehicle-to-Everything communications in next-generation ITS.},

  abstract     = {The performance of existing object detection algorithms significantly degrades when applied to low-resolution infrared (IR) images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which suffers from slow inference speed, low detection precision, and redundant network parameters. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight real-time object detection network for UAV IR images, termed SGA-YOLO, which is designed based on the you only look at once version 8n (YOLOv8n) framework. First of all, the efficient SENetV2-neck enhances the correlation between different channels, which realizes efficient multi-scale feature fusion and improves detection precision. Subsequently, the lightweight S2GM backbone combines ShuffleNetV2-stride2 and C2f_Ghost modules, which significantly reduces the network parameters and increases inference speed. Finally, the adaptive fine-grained channel (AFGC) attention mechanism is coupled to further enhance detection precision and effectively mitigate background interference. Compared with the YOLOv8n, SGA-YOLO achieves a 27% reduction in network parameters, a 4.7% increment in precision, a 2.5% increment in recall rate, a 30.86% reduction in GFLOPs, a 16.3% increment in FPS, a 3.50% increment in mAP@0.5, and a 1.3% increment in mAP@0.5:0.95. In addition, it supports deployment on resource-constrained embedded system, offering a new perspective on designing lightweight UAV IR object detection networks for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicle (IV) navigation is a key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). To enhance their performance in positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), usually inputs from the exteroceptive sensors, e.g., camera (images) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (point clouds), can be used to identify the environment and objects, or help other sensors with signal quality assessment. However, the measurements from the interoceptive sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometer (ODO), are rarely considered, while they are more resilient to the environment changes and commonly equipped within the modern vehicles. Integrating the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) algorithm and centered on the inertial navigation system (INS), this paper proposes a tightly coupled (TC) GNSS PPP/INS/ODO integration algorithm that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict non-holonomic constraint (NHC) components. To further assess the online prediction quality without ground truth, a novel cross-validation method is proposed, also to adjust the corresponding measurement variance. Results of field tests show that, compared with traditional GNSS PPP/INS/ODO system, the proposed algorithm can achieve an average root mean square (RMS) improvement of (16.05%, 16.03%, 16.06%) and a maximum (MAX) improvement of (22.10%, 27.57%, 29.90%) in positioning along the north, east and down (NED) directions. More importantly, the proposed method can effectively mitigate the degradation in positioning performance caused by erroneous constraints under complex motion conditions.},

The integration of renewable generation in EVCS helps to achieve the goal of green energy. The random behaviour of EVs and uncertainty in renewable generation make EVCS energy management difficult. This paper proposes a pricing, energy management strategy and a charging coordination algorithm to address these issues. The strategy develops an incentive-based dynamic pricing for EV services based on the energy economic assessment of EVCS. The strategy introduces an uncertainty factor and an error factor to estimate the renewable generation and power bid precisely for participating in the day-ahead energy market to purchase energy for EVCS. The proposed charging coordination algorithm manages the EV services in real time and optimizes the EV cost and EVCS profit. A Battery Energy Storage (BES) is integrated into EVCS, and an algorithm is proposed to coordinate its operation to provide stable power by managing the renewable power fluctuations. The results show that the proposed strategy manages the EVCS demand efficiently and reduces the burden on the grid. The proposed coordination algorithm increases EV profit by 21.95 % and the EVCS profit increases by 32.35%.},

Advanced ACC algorithms have been applied to improve traffic efficiency and have demonstrated energy savings. Yet they have typically been deployed in a single-use case: car-following mode. In this mode, where the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) maintains an appropriate distance or time gap with the preceding vehicle, decelerating when the gap is small and accelerating when it is large, the system may struggle to guarantee safety and comfort in complex and variable driving scenarios. Although there exist mode-switching ACC and merge mode controllers, in which even involving latitude direction control have been proposed, their dynamics when driving alongside other controlled or human-driving vehicles under a Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) traffic environment remains unclear.

Although cybersecurity standards provide structured approaches to risk management, their integration into railway-specific system lifecycles remains fragmented, and their practical implementation is still underexplored in both academic and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive and methodologically grounded study addressing these limitations through two main contributions. First, it provides a detailed analysis of the primary cybersecurity standards applicable to the railway domain, with a particular focus on the risk assessment frameworks defined in CENELEC TS 50701 and IEC 62443. Second, it offers a comparative analysis of selected standards, identifying complementarities and opportunities for cross-domain synergies with other safety-critical sectors, supported by illustrative examples of practical applications. Additionally, the paper delivers a critical review of existing literature on railway cybersecurity, revealing persistent gaps in lifecycle integration, interdisciplinary alignment, and the contextual adaptation of cybersecurity measures to the specific operational and safety constraints of the railway sector. By synthesizing these findings, the study contributes a coherent foundation for aligning cybersecurity governance with the unique demands of railway systems, offering actionable insights for researchers, practitioners, and regulatory bodies working to secure next-generation railway infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Rail corrugation is a common rail surface defect in wheel–rail system and can significantly reduce the running quality of vehicles. Accurate and fast detection of corrugation is of great importance for uncovering its mechanism, predicting the evolution and planning maintenance. Traditional physical model-driven detection approaches rely on high-fidelity simulations and are poorly automated. The popular data-driven methods have good availability. However, they ignore the power of expert experience, resulting in limited accuracy. This paper presents a quantitative model for detecting rail corrugation based on measurement data and expert knowledge using deep learning (DL) algorithms. First, a data quality improvement framework is proposed to overcome the problem that conventional DL models may produce incorrect results when trained on low-quality datasets. Then, the characteristics of rail corrugation are deeply investigated and adaptive targeted loss and directed metric functions are developed according to the individual samples to build a detection model with better global feature regression and local detail convergence. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using on-site measurement data from a commercial metro line. Comparative analyses and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of targeted loss and directed metric in terms of more accurate detection and scientific evaluation of rail corrugation roughness, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Road image segmentation plays a pivotal role in traffic video surveillance for environmental perception. Precise segmentation of roads and lanes is essential for effective traffic monitoring and management. However, unlike the perspective encountered in autonomous driving, the surveillance perspective poses unique challenges due to its wider scope and susceptibility to complex environments. This complexity makes the segmentation task in road surveillance videos particularly demanding. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that leverages a CNN-Transformer architecture. Firstly, a spatial pyramid attention-style convolution (SP-AttnConv) module, built upon the Transformer is introduced, to ensure accurate segmentation across long distances while preserving fine boundary information. This module enhances local information and fosters a “global-local” feature fusion framework. Secondly, to tackle the issue of scale imbalance during segmentation, a lightweight multi-scale (LMS) module is introduced to capture multi-scale feature. Additionally, an occlusion relief branch (ORB) module is integrated into the decoder, specifically addressing occlusions caused by irrelevant objects. Recognizing the need for a dedicated benchmark dataset for road surface and lane segmentation, surface-lane (SL) for complex scenarios is built in our paper to promote the development of traffic surveillance system. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance on the SL dataset.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes SDN-MAOTRP, a multicriteria adaptive opportunistic multicast routing protocol that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and deep learning. It enables efficient Vehicle-to-Vehicle Telescreen (VVT) services, including delay-sensitive and real-time multimedia dissemination, and are critical components of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, the deployment of VVT in ITS is hindered by challenges such as high mobility, frequent topology changes, packet loss, and latency, which degrade Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). To address these challenges, SDN-MAOTRP incorporates an intelligent SDN controller which dynamically performs multicast routing decisions according to network conditions, user feedback, and historical data. In contrast to traditional multicast protocols that rely heavily on broadcasting - often resulting in network congestion and performance degradation - SDN-MAOTRP strategically decouples the control and data planes by utilizing LTE for control signaling and IEEE 802.11p for multimedia data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that SDN-MAOTRP significantly improves both QoS and QoE, providing a scalable, efficient, and ITS-compliant solution for robust multimedia communication in dynamic vehicular environments.},

  abstract     = {In the low-altitude economy, ensuring the safe and agile flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic obstacle environments is essential for expanding interactive applications like parcel delivery. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promise for UAV motion planning and control, its trial-and-error exploration often struggles to ensure both agility and safety, especially under uncertain observational noise. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep confidence-enhanced reachability policy optimization (DCRPO) framework. By integrating safe DRL with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), DCRPO achieves high-level safety decisions, complex real-time joint planning and control for UAVs. Furthermore, we develop a deep confidence-enhanced reachability guarantee that constructs a set of stochastically forward-reachable planned trajectories under uncertainty, enabling robust safety collision probability certifications. This safe reachability mechanism adaptively selects belief space actions from planned actions to interact with the environment, further enhancing safety and reducing training time. In extensive experiments of UAVs traversing a fast-moving rectangular gate, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods under varying environments in terms of operational robustness. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly reduces overall collision violations and training time, greatly improving both training safety and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control plans significantly impact transportation system efficiency by regulating traffic conditions at intersections. Adaptive traffic plans that can adjust to real-time road conditions are more effective as a result. Reinforcement learning succeeds at adapting strategies based on feedback derived from the environment, and is thus proficient in dealing with complex traffic scenarios that change dynamically. However, current RL methods rely on significant computational periods to obtain precise functioning mechanisms within the scenarios, posing barriers to their adoption for new scenarios. In addition to directly optimizing the RL model itself to enable fast learning from scratch, another idea is to make the model transferable or reusable with the learned experience. Given the diversity of migration scenarios, the underlying control algorithm should guarantee convergence and endeavor to be parameter-insensitive. From the above concern, we proposed MetaSignal, an efficient meta-reinforcement learning method for traffic signal control. Specifically, our approach utilizes the Fourier basis as the value function approximation in reinforcement learning, distinguishing it from methods like neural network approximation. This linear approximation offers advantages such as convergence facilitation, error bound achievement, and reduced parameter dependence. The meta-learning framework adopts a model-agnostic approach, enabling effective adaptation of the base model to the target scenario with limited training cost. Empirically, the proposed method shows promising and stable performance for traffic signal control through comprehensive comparison experiments in both synthetic and real-world traffic networks.},

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic spatio-temporal attention-based GNN model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), termed the dynamic graph ordinary differential equation (DGODE) model. Building upon the prior graph ordinary differential equation (GODE) framework, DGODE employs ODEs to mitigate the over-smoothing problem in GNNs and further incorporates dynamic graph structures to enhance the graph information extraction capabilities of GODE. These enhancements enable DGODE to optimize the integration of ODEs within GNNs, alleviate overfitting, and deepen the mining of spatio-temporal dependencies. The related experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing baseline models, the proposed DGODE model achieves superior performance in traffic flow prediction with a reduced prediction error rate.},

The complexity arises from the diverse and ambiguous nature of off-road conditions, coupled with the specific characteristics of the driving platform. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework for terrain traversability analysis, incorporating a contrastive label disambiguation mechanism. The proposed framework integrates traversability learning with real-time scene reconstruction. By projecting actual driving experience onto the terrain models, weakly labeled training samples with pseudo-labels can be automatically generated. Furthermore, a prototype-based contrastive representation learning method with the aid of a local window-based transformer encoder is designed to learn distinguishable embeddings, facilitating the self-supervised updating of those pseudo labels. Through the iterative interaction between representation learning and pseudo label updating, the inherent ambiguities associated with those pseudo labels are gradually eliminated. This enables the acquisition of fine-grained and platform-specific terrain traversability insights, eliminating the need for any human-provided annotations. Experimental results on the publicly available RELLIS-3D dataset and two self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and jointly predicting multimodal transportation demand is crucial for pre-allocating transport resources, enhancing the resilience of traffic systems. However, current approaches insufficiently explore inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity, resulting in undifferentiated dependency extraction. Moreover, existing research struggles to model cross-mode interactions among three or more transportation modes and adapt to dynamic relations in multimodal demand. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal demand prediction model based on a meta-parameter learning network (MMDNet), centered on characterizing multimodal traffic spatial-temporal heterogeneity and unifying the modeling of cross-mode interactions. Our model features: 1) a spatial-temporal heterogeneity meta-parameter learning method, capturing both inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity to steer more targeted dependency extraction than previous studies; 2) a spatial-temporal evolving unified graph generator, transcending prior studies’ limitations in unifying dynamic interactions across three or more modes by creating dynamic unified graphs. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (New York, Beijing and Chicago) covering four different traffic modes are carried out to evaluate the MMDNet. The model achieves a 6.65% performance gain over advanced baselines and demonstrates strong cross-city adaptability. Abundant interpretability analyses show our model can semantically encode explainable cross-mode interactions and differences between modes.

Specifically, first, we introduce a Gaussian error function to address the input saturation constraints and employ a command filter to avoid the “explosion of complexity” problem. Furthermore, we design a novel prescribed performance function to constrain the transient and steady-state indicators of the tracking error and allow switching the desired tracking trajectory. An adaptive hybrid event-triggering mechanism is subsequently proposed to mitigate redundant communication demands. Next, a switching self-tuning mechanism is constructed to compensate for the negative effects of the uncertainty term. Based on this mechanism, our scheme ensures that the error converges to a user-defined convergence domain that is independent of the uncertainty term. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through Lyapunov-based stability analysis and numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Navigation of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordinated by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is efficient and reliable for deep ocean exploration. AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming. Numerical simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.},

Thus, LaSalle's Lemma is used to design a powerful controller that certifies the global asymptotic trajectory tracking. Second, the nominal model of the quadrotor is extended to include the actuator defect and external perturbation. Global asymptotic stability of the following error is then certified by developing an adaptive fault-tolerant control method for the disturbed quadrotor. In order to strengthen the system's implementation against the unknown upper-bounded disturbance, the adaptive control process is used in the final section to estimate the external disruption's unknown upper bound. The suggested approach's primary benefits are the tracking error's global asymptotic reachability, the introduction of a fault-tolerant control strategy, and the suggestion of a chattering-free controller. Lastly, the viability and efficiency of the proposed controller for the trajectory tracking of the disrupted quadrotor with the actuator defect are verified using simulation and hardware-in-loop implementations.},

However, the design of its inner elements such as the reward function and action distribution limits its generalisation to different environments. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based expert learning algorithm that combines previous expert experiences with on-line learning to regularise and improve the policy learning effectively. This is done by following an action distribution algorithm that allows a learner agent to mix its own actions with expert ones for learning improvement and fast convergence.

  abstract     = {Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure ‘natural ordinal relation’ common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and OR tasks.},

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various natural language processing tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and generate specific-domain content. Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. However, LLMs are sequential models for textual data, but graphs are non-sequential topological data. It is challenging to adapt LLMs to tackle graph analytics tasks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) in terms of three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graphs and LLMs, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning, and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of the discussed LLM-GGA models.

  abstract     = {Clustering as a fundamental technique in data mining and machine learning, aims to partition data into meaningful groups based on the inherent relationships among data. However, traditional clustering algorithms typically assume convex hyperspherical geometry of data, where the clusters have clearly defined boundaries and do not overlap. In contrast, real-world data often exhibits complex and non-convex geometries, which makes these assumptions ineffective and lead to inaccurate clustering results that fail to capture the intrinsic structure. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a novel granular clustering based on an enhanced granularity representation, which further refines the principle of justifiable granularity. By introducing a more precise and flexible hyper-box granulation mechanism, the method dynamically adapts to the topology of data, thereby improving clustering accuracy. By defining the degree of aggregation and discreteness between data points, the importance of attributes in the feature space is quantified, leading to the design of a novel hyper-box feature selection (HBFS) algorithm. This algorithm integrates the granular clustering principle to optimize the feature selection process, reducing the impact of redundant features and noise, thus improving clustering efficiency and interpretability. To validate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on fifteen publicly available datasets, comparing the performance of HBFS algorithm with classical and state-of-art feature selection methods. The results and the statistical significance tests show that HBFS significantly outperforms existing feature selection methods across various evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval, where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED) are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region (G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e., graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference. Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph similarity.},

Nevertheless, the representation learning ability of existing TRL models are limited for a nonstandard tensor due to its inability to accurately represent the specific nature of the nonstandard tensor, i.e., mode imbalance, high-dimension, and incompleteness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a Mode-Aware Tucker Networkbased Tensor Representation Learning (MTN-TRL) model with three-fold ideas: a) designing a mode-aware Tucker network to accurately represent the imbalanced mode of a nonstandard tensor, b) building an MTN-based high-efficient TRL model that fuses both data density-oriented modeling principle and adaptive parameters learning scheme, and c) theoretically proving the MTN-TRL model's convergence.

The graph-graph relationship, revealing the deviation and similarity between graphs, offers global insights into the entire graph level for highlighting the anomalies' divergence from normal graph patterns. Thus, understanding graph-graph relationships is critical to boosting models on GLAD tasks. However, existing deep GLAD algorithms heavily rely on Graph Neural Networks that primarily focus on analyzing individual graphs. These methods overlook the significance of graph-graph relationships in telling anomalies from normal graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel model for Graph-level Anomaly Detection using the Transformer technique, namely GADTrans. Specifically, GADTrans build the transformer upon crucial subgraphs mined by a parametrized extractor, for modeling precise graph-graph relationships. The learned graph-graph relationships put effort into distinguishing normal and anomalous graphs. In addition, a specific loss is introduced to guide GADTrans in highlighting the deviation between anomalous and normal graphs while underlining the similarities among normal graphs. GADTrans achieves model interpretability by delivering human-interpretable results, which are learned graph-graph relationships and crucial subgraphs. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of GADTrans for GLAD tasks.},

However, existing approaches still face significant limitations, particularly when network structures evolve from lower-order to higher-order networks, or when the dynamical equation of the network is governed by multiple dynamical terms, such as local self-dynamics, lower-order and higher-order coupling dynamics. To this end, we propose a universal physics-informed neural network framework capable of predicting various types of dynamics on both lower- and higher-order networks. First, the framework captures and integrates more nonlinear features through the higher-order term expansion module. Second, we design a hybrid neural network module to differentially learn each dynamical term to comprehensively capture network dynamics. Finally, a physics-informed loss function construction module is introduced to integrate differential loss with prediction loss, improving the accuracy of network dynamical prediction. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in predicting network dynamics on both lower- and higher-order networks. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of each module. In addition, our method also performs well on real-world dynamical processes, which shows that it remains robust to real complex scenarios.},

This stems from a potential problem that has not been noticed and explored in existing studies: information granularity heterogeneity, which refers to the natural difference in information granularity between fast sampling rate data (high information granularity) and slow sampling rate data (low information granularity). Such an imbalance in information granularity can hinder forecasting relationships modeling and induce biased causal learning. Therefore, we propose a Mutual Information-iNspired causal Discovery framework (MIND), aiming to derive rate-agnostic features with consistent information granularity to alleviate information granularity heterogeneity problem. Technically, MIND comprises Stage 1 (pre-training) and Stage 2 (fine-tuning and causal discovery). In Stage 1, empowered by pseudo-slow sampling rate data (generated through the interleaved down sampling strategy) and mutual information, we can eliminate the influence of sampling rates and drive rate-aware encoders (RAEs) to sense key information (i.e., rate-agnostic) that remains unchanged across varying sampling rates. In Stage 2, the well-trained RAEs can extract rate-agnostic features from real multi-rate time series, thus facilitating effective forecasting relationships modeling and yield accurate causal discovery. Empirically, MIND realizes superior performance on various multi-rate scenarios, including four simulation datasets and one real-world dataset.},

Information granules, a fundamental component of Granular Computing (GrC), play a crucial role in human cognition. In this study, we develop a granular classifier called DBCGM, which facilitates delivering models with improved accuracy and efficiency in big data classification. In particular, DBCGM achieves the goal through the following four steps. First, we construct a 1-D index for each point and then utilize a context-based data bisection method to obtain non-overlapping subsets. These disjoint subsets enhance both the quality and efficiency of big data clustering and make it possible to process the entire dataset simultaneously. Next, we propose a cascade weighted clustering (CWC) algorithm to generate numeric prototypes from the obtained subsets. Then, following the principle of justification granularity (PJG), the numeric prototypes are refined into information granules. Finally, the classifier can be regarded as the weighted sum of all the values of the spatial relationship between the input instance and the information granules. We evaluate the performance of DBCGM in terms of accuracy, V-measure, and execution time. We compare DBCGM with benchmark classifiers and three big data granulating methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and public datasets show that DBCGM outperforms the existing methods. In particular, compared with the state-of-the-art method, DBCGM reduces the running time by an average of 2.55%, and improves the V-measure and accuracy by an average of 5.71% and 2.32%, respectively.},

For example, users might ask: What are the crime hotspots during [12:00-20:00]? To address this issue, we introduce ${\sf FlexiCrime}$, a novel event-centric framework for predicting crime hotspots with flexible time intervals. ${\sf FlexiCrime}$ incorporates a continuous-time attention network to capture correlations between crime events, which learns crime context features, representing general crime patterns across time points and locations. Furthermore, we introduce a type-aware spatiotemporal point process that learns crime-evolving features, measuring the risk of specific crime types at a given time and location by considering the frequency of past crime events. Together, the crime context and evolving features allow us to predict whether an urban area is a crime hotspot given a future time interval. To evaluate ${\sf FlexiCrime}$'s effectiveness, we conducted experiments using real-world datasets from two cities, covering twelve crime types. The results show that our model outperforms baseline techniques in predicting crime hotspots over flexible time intervals.},

To address this problem, recent approaches typically designate the embedding of some behaviors as primary embeddings and use the embeddings of other behaviors to enhance the primary behavior recommendation. However, these models may excel in recommending primary behaviors at the expense of degrading the performance of auxiliary behaviors. As a result, modern recommender systems often need to maintain multiple sets of collaborative filtering embeddings to achieve satisfactory recommendation performance across all behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Behavior Merging Graphs. Instead of modeling each behavior separately, BMG uses a joint graph to capture potential behavior merging sets between nodes and applies the partial order theory to model the intricate structures and relational order among behavior merging sets. Based on BMG, we introduce the Behavior Merging Graphs Convolutional Networks (BMGCN), which aggregates neighbor information by integrating convolutional weights that account for the rank transformation of Behavior Merging Order across various behavior merging sets. Furthermore, BMGCN employs behavior merging-based sampling to guide the traditional BPR sampling process, enhancing embedding training.

Specifically, patients/doctors are treated as terminal users, medical institutions are viewed as edge nodes, and medical clouds form the central storage layer. In the process of data auditing, third-party auditor can achieve integrity auditing of medical cloud storage data. Moreover, different medical institutions use private-set-intersection technology to share the common user's electronic medical data, while for other users not in intersection set, their data does not need to be shared.

However, numerous time series contain unavoidable missing data, making it challenging to model the temporal dynamics of sequential data. Various data imputation methods have been proposed to infer missing values in time series. Although sequences recorded at fixed time intervals are presented in discrete form, they possess an inherent temporal continuity, which is ignored in most existing approaches. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Attentive Continuous-Time Generative Adversarial Network (ACGANet) to estimate unobserved values in irregular sequences. ACGANet captures the temporal dynamics by transforming the discrete sequence into the continuous-time flow, thereby modeling the underlying distribution of the real data. Furthermore, ACGANet employs an adversarial learning strategy to alleviate the error introduced by imputed values, with the discriminator distinguishing between real and generated samples. Additionally, ACGANet introduces the log-density of hidden temporal states as an auxiliary loss to further optimize the generator. This allows the model to simultaneously focus on the overall temporal dynamics of the time series and the underlying distribution of the missing data. Extensive experiments on three publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that ACGANet achieves state-of-the-art performance in imputing incomplete time series. Moreover, both qualitative and quantitative analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Community Detection (CD) in weighted social networks is a highly active research field, celebrated for its profound practical implications across a multitude of disciplines. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are frequently explored to tackle CD problems, leveraging their capability to navigate the extensive discrete search space effectively. Throughout the evolutionary process, genetic operators such as crossover and mutation assume pivotal roles in effectively exploring the vast solution space. Nonetheless, prevailing GA-based approaches often ignore crucial topology information, particularly information regarding edge weights, resulting in compromised algorithm performance. In light of this, this paper introduces Edge Information-based GA (EIGA) to effectively solve CD problems in weighted networks. This is achieved specifically through the innovative designs of edgeweight-aware crossover and mutation operators. These novel edge-weight-aware operators improve the extraction of meaningful community structures, advancing knowledge discovery from social networks. Empirical findings demonstrate the superior performance of EIGA over numerous state-of-the-art algorithms across various real-world and synthetic benchmark networks.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests.},

  abstract     = {Models based on Transformer variants have consistently demonstrated leading performance in long sequence time series forecasting. However, in some complex application scenarios, Transformers tend to capture low-frequency information in the data while overlooking high-frequency information, which often contains rich non-stationary features. This unbalanced feature extraction approach limits the model's ability to effectively handle real-world time series data. To address this issue, we explicitly represent both low-frequency and high-frequency information and propose a model called STCNet, a data-driven scale-adaptive convolutional network that aims to extract diverse features and patterns from the data by learning features across different frequency bands in a balanced manner. Specifically, we propose an entropy-based adaptive wavelet basis selection algorithm, which can adaptively select appropriate wavelet bases based on the data distribution to achieve effective multi-frequency decomposition of complex time series. In addition, we designed a hierarchical scale-adaptive factor that allows for dynamic adjustment of feature weights according to different time scales through refined layered weight adjustment, significantly enhancing the model's capability in handling non-stationary time series features. To further optimize the output features of the model, we introduce a test-time training mechanism, combined with a fast weight update strategy and a weight-sharing strategy to reduce the number of model parameters, effectively mitigating the risk of overfitting. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that STCNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Recent studies have focused on designing distance or similarity metrics to provide better knowledge representation between entities and relations. However, three issues with negative sampling remain unexplored: 1) the construction of negative queries heavily relies on manual experience in selecting candidate tail entities, 2) the constructed negative queries may mislabel potential true facts, and 3) the varying difficulties of negative queries are ignored. To solve the above issues, in this paper, we introduce curriculum learning into few-shot KGC and propose a novel few-shot KGC framework empowered by an adaptive negative sampling mechanism, which can eliminate the dependence on any additional manual experience, reduce mislabeling, and generate negative queries with appropriate difficulty. Specifically, the proposed framework includes two alternating phases. In the negative sampling phase, we first design a novel positive-unlabeled learning based scoring function with a type-related candidates encoder and then build a variable-speed sliding window based pacing function to select negative queries with appropriate learning difficulty under current training step. In the meta-training phase, we develop an adapted triple-oriented knowledge encoder to provide accurate representation for queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and provides negative queries with appropriate difficulty in few-shot KGC.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models have achieved high predictive accuracy, but their opaque “black-box” nature limits practical value: educators cannot trace why predictions are made and learners cannot obtain transparent feedback. Existing explainability techniques, which aim to explain why a model makes a particular prediction and provide the evidence for it, predominantly rely on correlational analyses, often yielding unfaithful or suboptimal explanations. To address this, we propose RCKTE, a post hoc reinforcement learning-based causal deep knowledge tracing explainer. RCKTE operates through a structured workflow: First, it formulates the explanation task as a globally optimal subsequence screening problem, aiming to identify the most causally influential historical interactions from a student's learning sequence. Then, a reinforcement learning agent, guided by a causal attribution reward and a dual optimizer scheme, iteratively constructs the optimal subsequences by assessing the causal impact of each interaction. This process results in more faithful and concise explainable subsequences than those produced by correlation-based methods, achieving this within about one second to support real-time use. Finally, these explainable subsequences directly support actionable educational applications, including identifying a learner's weak knowledge for targeted review, constructing personalized knowledge structure graphs for intervention tracking, and deriving group-level knowledge structures to guide curriculum design. Extensive experiments across multiple DLKT models and datasets confirm that RCKTE consistently outperforms existing post hoc methods in both the faithfulness and readability of explanations. By integrating causal attribution with reinforcement learning, RCKTE provides accurate, efficient, and educationally meaningful explanations that enhance the usability of DLKT in real learning environments. The implementation code and related resources are available at https://github.com/codeset-XKT/RCKTE.},

In recent years, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has breathed new life into educational agents and pushed them into a new stage of intelligence. This survey tries to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of LLM-based agents in education. First, the developments of educational agents are presented as background information. Subsequently, we propose a unified architecture for LLM-based educational agents, including perception, profiling, memory, reasoning, and action modules, and summarize two primary methods (i.e., fine-tuning and prompt engineering) for equipping them with abilities. Next, we categorize the potential applications of LLM-based educational agents across the “teaching-learning-assessment-research” chain, and discover that LLM-based educational agent can play significant roles in various educational tasks. Furthermore, we reveal that when assessing the effectiveness of LLM-based educational agents, subjective evaluation remains dominant, supplemented by objective evaluation. Finally, the open issues and future research directions in this field are discussed from multiple perspectives. We hope that this survey can provide valuable insights and inspirations for researchers and practitioners to enhance the further development of educational agents in the future.},

Accurate and real-time localization is crucial for MAV swarms, but current practices lack a low-cost, high-precision, and real-time solution, especially for lightweight BMAVs. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by transforming AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures for BMAVs. However, translating this insight into a practical system is challenging due to issues in estimating locations with diverse and unknown localization errors of BMAVs, and allocating resources of AMAVs considering interconnected influential factors. This work introduces TransformLoc, a new framework that transforms AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures, specifically designed for low-cost and resource-constrained BMAVs. We design an error-aware joint location estimation model to perform intermittent joint estimation for BMAVs and introduce a similarity-instructed adaptive grouping-scheduling strategy to allocate resources of AMAVs dynamically. TransformLoc achieves a collaborative, adaptive, and cost-effective localization system suitable for large-scale heterogeneous MAV swarms. We implement and validate TransformLoc on industrial drones. Results show it outperforms all baselines by up to 68% in localization performance, improving navigation success rates by 60%. Extensive robustness and ablation experiments further highlight superiority of its design.},

This poses an even bigger problem when dealing with sensitive data. Moreover, fingerprint readers and front-facing cameras were not designed to continuously identify users. In this study, we developed MagPrint++ , a novel approach to fingerprint users based on unique patterns in the electromagnetic (EM) signals associated with the specific use patterns of users. Initial experiments showed that time-varying EM patterns are unique to individual users. They are also temporally and spatially consistent, which makes them suitable for fingerprinting. MagPrint++ has a number of advantages over existing schemes: i) Non-intrusive fingerprinting, ii) implementation both on COTS mobile phones and a small and easy-to-deploy device, and iii) high accuracy thanks to the proposed classification algorithm. In experiments involving 30 users, MagPrint++ achieves $94.3\%$ accuracy in classifying users from these traces, which represents a $10.9\%$ improvement over the state-of-the-art classification method.},

  abstract     = {Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is fundamental for the reliable, low-latency networks that will enable the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Wi-Fi has historically been considered unfit for TSN, as channel contention and collisions prevent deterministic transmission delays. However, this issue can be overcome by using Target Wake Time (TWT), which enables the access point to instruct Wi-Fi stations to wake up and transmit in non-overlapping TWT Service Periods (SPs), and sleep in the remaining time. In this paper, we first formulate the TWT Acceptance and Scheduling Problem (TASP), with the objective to schedule TWT SPs that maximize traffic throughput and energy efficiency while respecting Age of Information (AoI) constraints. Then, due to TASP being NP-hard, we propose the TASP Efficient Resolver (TASPER), a heuristic strategy to find near-optimal solutions efficiently. Using a TWT simulator based on ns-3, we compare TASPER to several baselines, including HSA, a state-of-the-art solution originally designed for WirelessHART networks. We demonstrate that TASPER obtains up to 24.97% lower mean transmission rejection cost and saves up to 14.86% more energy compared to the leading baseline, ShortestFirst, in a challenging, large-scale scenario. Additionally, when compared to HSA, TASPER also reduces the energy consumption by 34% and reduces the mean rejection cost by 26%. Furthermore, we validate TASPER on our IIoT testbed, which comprises 10 commercial TWT-compatible stations, observing that our solution admits more transmissions than the best baseline strategy, without violating any AoI deadline.},

Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving assistance. Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwell time and communication duration. This results in unfair access to network resources, potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI.

This paper introduces Secrecy Energy Efficiency (SEE) as a new performance metric for hybrid radio-optical wireless networks, enabling a quantitative assessment of secure communication under power-constrained conditions. We formulate and solve optimization problems to maximize the optical secrecy rate and SEE. We extend this analysis to a joint allocation framework for Ultra Wideband (UWB) and Near-Infrared (NIR) channels. Our approach leverages Sequential Fractional Programming (SFP), which enables to tackle the non-convex SEE maximization problem by a sequence of convex problems, addressing secure transmissions' inherent non-convexity and fractional nature with intentional jamming. Based on lab-based in-body measurements through porcine tissue and on radio and optical average synthetic phantoms, numerical evaluations demonstrate that the NIR link can achieve approximately 3 bit/Hz/Joule in SEE. Further, we show that optimal power allocation significantly outperforms random allocation methods, highlighting the potential of this approach for mission-critical healthcare applications. These findings provide a robust foundation for designing next-generation, low-power medical communication systems that balance security requirements with stringent energy constraints.},

To address this issue, we propose FedMSBA, a layer-wise privacy-preservation method that adaptively allocates privacy budgets via Rényi DP (RDP) and modified sensitivity. FedMSBA dynamically scales noise to model intricacies and adaptively choose the better applied DP mechanisms, which provides a tighter mathematical bound and finally prevents non-convergence while resisting reconstruction attacks. Experiments demonstrate superior privacy-utility trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art defenses. FedMSBA achieves an approximately 2% improvement in accuracy and a 5% enhancement in privacy preservation. Furthermore, FedMSBA's performance remains nearly unaffected by variations in the privacy budget $\epsilon$ and failure rate $\delta$.},

According to the data collection scheme and the required data granularity, data collection in IoTs can be classified into pull-based/push-based data collection as well as node-level/target-level data collection. Thus, there are four scenarios for data collection: Push-based node-level data collection (Push-Node), Push-based target-level data collection (Push-Target), Pull-based node-level data collection (Pull-Node), and Pull-based target-level data collection (Pull-Target). Energy-Harvesting IoT (EH-IoT) is an important component of IoTs and the Age of Information (AoI) minimization problem has been studied extensively for data collection in EH-IoTs. However, existing works only studied the problem under the scenario of Push-Node, Push-Target and Pull-Node. Therefore, this paper investigates the AoI minimization problem for Pull-based Target-level data collection in EH-IoTs (AoI-Pull-Target) for the first time. AoI-Pull-Target is formally defined and proved to be NP-hard. A two-stage dynamic programming-based node scheduling algorithm and a real-time schedule adjustment scheme are proposed to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically.

  abstract     = {Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices, we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service provision widely used for 5G.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) extends cloud computing to the network edge, supporting resource-intensive mobile applications. Service migration ensures seamless continuity and high-quality service (QoS) when users move between MEC servers. In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the high mobility of vehicles causes network instability, complicating the collection of system information. In addition, vehicles impose strict latency and green energy requirements, and the search for the Pareto front among conflicting objectives increases the complexity of migration. Existing service migration methods rely on centralized decision making using complete system information, which is not suitable for the user-centric IoV environment. Current multi-objective reinforcement learning approaches lack sufficient exploration randomness, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose the Adversarial Variational State Inference with Maximum Entropy Multi-Objective Policy Optimization (AVSIMEMPO) algorithm to address the partially observable and multi-objective optimization problem, optimizing migration node selection. The service migration problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To solve this, we design an encoding network, AVSI, integrating Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and adversarial learning to extract hidden state. We also introduce the Maximum Entropy Multi-Objective Policy Optimization (MEMPO) algorithm, which enhances exploration randomness through maximum entropy and dynamic weight design. Extensive experiments based on real mobility trajectories show that our method outperforms baseline algorithms and achieves nearoptimal results in various MEC scenarios.},

However, heterogeneous data distributions often hinder a single global model from performing optimally across diverse clients. In this paper, we introduce two personalized federated learning methods to address the aforementioned challenge. First, we introduce a gradient-fusion approach that merges global gradients aggregated via a learnable collaboration matrix with local gradients tailored to each client's data. This fusion harmonizes collective intelligence with device-specific knowledge, thereby improving personalization under data heterogeneity. Second, we propose a gradient-decoupling method that mitigates the limitations of relying solely on a collaboration matrix for balancing knowledge sharing and personalization. By decoupling the tasks and regularizing local updates through the incorporation of extracted collective intelligence, we introduce an inductive bias that significantly improves generalization. Extensive evaluations on four computed tomography and pathology imaging datasets covering a wide range of heterogeneity show that our frameworks substantially outperform existing baselines. We also provide theoretical analyses that establish performance bounds and convergence guarantees under mild assumptions.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an intelligent omni-surface (IOS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a base station (BS) provides simultaneous target sensing and communication services with an IOS under outdated and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Both the communication sum-rate and sensing signal-to-noise ratio are maximized through joint optimization of BS beamforming and IOS configuration. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent joint optimization scheme called meta multi-objective hybrid deep reinforcement learning (meta-MHDRL). Specifically, the meta-MHDRL framework first introduces a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that integrates double-critic-based deep deterministic policy gradient with deep double Q-network algorithms, enabling parallel optimization of both continuous-domain variables (i.e., BS beamforming, IOS reflecting phase shift, and IOS reflecting/refracting amplitudes) and the discrete-domain variable (i.e., IOS refracting phase shift). Thereafter, an objective-preference weight is incorporated into the hybrid DRL framework, such that meta-MHDRL can capture the trade-off between communication and sensing performance. To address the complex coupling relationships among different optimization variables, we further put forth a synchronized experience replay mechanism for meta-MHDRL, which maintains training synchronization among different neural networks. In addition, a meta-learning approach is developed to enhance the generalization ability of meta-MHDRL across different objective-preference weights. Simulation results show that meta-MHDRL attains more Pareto-efficient solutions than other schemes under outdated and imperfect CSI while maintaining stronger robustness across various simulation setups. Besides, we demonstrate the generalization ability of meta-MHDRL for unseen tasks},

The embedding of Bidirectional Service Function Chains (BSFCs) for these applications has been studied. However, existing BSFC embedding research only considers static users, and the prevailing Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) placement methods do not account for the impact of individual node resources on the path, thus failing to maximize node resource utilization at the network level. Considering the aforementioned issues, we introduce a framework for BSFC embedding tailored for mobile users, named Path as a Point (PAAP). This framework integrates the resources of the paths and then globally considers the impact of the computing resources of edge nodes on the paths connecting them, maximizing edge node resource utilization across the entire network. We propose a three-phase algorithm within the PAAP framework. In the first phase, we introduce a singleuser algorithm for VNFs deployment during BSFC embedding. In the second phase, this optimization is extended to multiple users by establishing inter-user association rules. In the third phase, candidate application placement positions are evaluated across the entire network, culminating in the determination of optimal placement strategies. Empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods.},

We propose DGR-FCL, an FCL framework that bounds forgetting via server-side, diffusion-based generative replay. The generator is trained with margin constraints and batch-normalization alignment to faithfully recover previously learned distributions. On each client, we introduce supervised contrastive learning with synthetic negatives to separate old and new classes, and an importance-weighted feature-distillation strategy to constrain representation drift along feature directions critical for old tasks. Theoretically, an integral probability metric (IPM) analysis shows that margin preservation on replay data ensures bounded forgetting. Empirically, DGR-FCL achieves consistent 4–5% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID benchmarks, offering a robust solution to the stability–plasticity trade-off in decentralized, continuously evolving environments.},

The communication security of IoT devices is the foundation for their large-scale development.

This framework introduces DICE technology to generate device firmware identifiers, constructs a trust chain, and realizes hardware binding of device identities and firmware integrity measurement. Meanwhile, it designs a domain-specific identifier mapping mechanism, which integrates SDN domain DPID, IP domain prefix, and firmware identifiers to make physically adjacent nodes logically adjacent on the ring. Finally, it proposes a hierarchical trust aggregation protocol, which ensures secure communication between nodes through intra-domain local verification and cross-domain global aggregation with the help of a trust mechanism. Through formal proof, TruChord can resist Sybil attacks and collusion attacks. Simulation experiments show that TruChord outperforms the comparison frameworks in core indicators such as end-to-end delay, network traffic, and convergence time, providing an efficient solution for cross-domain secure communication of IoT devices.},

Considering the CCS system aggregates information at a backbone satellite and connect to the ground station via the satellite-integrated Internet, achieving timely transmission within this bottleneck link becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose an age-optimal rate control (ARC) protocol in transport layer, where each satellite in the CCS system independently and iteratively adjusts its transmit rate (TR) according to the feedback queuing delay at the backbone satellite to approach its age-optimal rate (AR), aimed at minimizing the average age of information (AAoI) of CCS system. Specifically, we derive the upper bound AAoI by modeling an $M/M/1$ queue at backbone satellite, and formulate an AAoI minimization problem by utilizing the upper bound AAoI and solve it to obtain the AR. Then, each satellite can calculate its expected rate (ER) by calculating the queuing delay via the timestamp of Acknowledgements (ACK) from backbone satellite, which is significantly larger than AR. Further, we design an Exponential then Additive Increase Additive Decrease (EAIAD) algorithm to control the convergence position and oscillation of TR, thereby avoiding the significantly increase in AAoI resulting from TR exceeds AR. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate that our ARC protocol achieves minimum AAoI compared to the state-of-the-art transport protocols.},

However, PFL models often encounter bidirectional catastrophic forgetting.

This challenge is further amplified in edge computing settings, where devices must adapt to fast-changing heterogeneous data. To address this issue, we propose FedSSM, a novel framework that leverages state-space models to mitigate forgetting in PFL. By capturing the temporal evolution of local model parameters through hidden states, the framework enhances the retention of critical knowledge throughout training rounds.

  abstract     = {Cross-edge video analytics is a technology that involves collaborative processing of video data among multiple edge devices. To handle increasingly complex video analytics tasks on edge devices with higher frame rates or improved accuracy, cross-edge video analytics leverages model partitioning techniques to divide Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models into multiple sub-models deployed across different computing nodes. This approach enables the efficient utilization of heterogeneous edge computing resources for compute-intensive CNN inference. Nonetheless, several challenges persist in cross-edge video analytics. These include the partitionability of CNN models requiring a lot of manual work, excessive transmission of intermediate features leading to performance degradation, and high computational complexity in partitioning decision-making. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Pao-Ding, a framework to accelerate cross-edge video analytics. Pao-Ding employs gradient information to automatically parse the structure of CNN models, thereby enabling partitionability for chain, simple Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and complex DAG models. By incorporating a skip-layer design, Pao-Ding is able to compress redundant intermediate features more accurately. Additionally, a layer-pruning-based algorithm is proposed in Pao-Ding which effectively reduces the computational overhead associated with partitioning decision-making. Experimental results on real hardware show that Pao-Ding supports automated model partitionability for 67 CNN models with a model coverage rate of 94.37%. Compared to state-of-the-art, Pao-Ding reduces total prediction error by 47.43%, lowers the partitioning decision time by 37.5%–58.35%, and decreases the average video frame processing time by 5.75%–22.18%. Furthermore, a cross-edge video analytics simulation platform developed using Docker and Pumba verifies the robustness of Pao-Ding under various conditions involving different number of nodes, computing capacities, and network environments.},

  abstract     = {In ultra-dense multi-access edge computing (MEC), efficient task offloading and resource allocation are critical to meeting stringent delay and energy constraints. However, the rapid growth in terminal devices poses a significant challenge to traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods, which struggle to maintain efficient task offloading and resource allocation due to increased computational complexity and decision latency. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a mean field theory (MFT)-guided DRL approach which leverages the statistical characteristics of a large population of terminal devices to reduce the computational complexity of decision-making. Firstly, we formulate the joint task offloading and resource allocation problem as a mean field Markov decision process (MFMDP) with the objective of minimizing the overall system energy consumption while satisfying the task delay requirements and resource constraints. Secondly, by leveraging the inherent structure of the MFMDP, which represents the system dynamics using state and action distributions rather than joint action spaces, we achieve significant dimensionality reduction and improved scalability. Thirdly, we prove that the Q-function of MFMDP satisfies the fixed point theory, and considering the continuity of task offloading and resource allocation variables, we develop an MFT-guided deep deterministic policy gradient (MFT-DDPG) algorithm to solve the proposed problem. Experimental results show that MFT-DDPG significantly outperforms conventional DRL baselines in convergence speed and scalability. Specifically, for 50 terminal devices, the training time of proposed MFT-DDPG is reduced by up to 86.1%, 92.1%, and 94.6% compared to those of MADDPG, QMIX, and DDPG, respectively. In comparison with the Edge Server Computing Only (ECO) scheme and Device and Edge Server Collaborative Computing (DECC) scheme, the proposed method consistently yields lower energy consumption and delay across varying numbers of terminal devices, transmission power, and edge server computing resources compared to benchmark solutions, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in ultra-dense MEC scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequency bands in 5G and future 6G networks promises an unprecedented capacity enhancement at the air interface driven by highly directional transmissions. While this facilitates interference suppression and increased deployment density, it also presents challenges in multicast service delivery, particularly due to the use of directional antennas and environmental factors that can cause signal blockage. Technologies such as Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged to address these challenges and reduce capital expenditure. This study comprehensively compares IAB- and RIS-based designs for cost-efficient densification in mmWave and sub-THz 5G/6G systems, focusing on both unicast and multicast traffic in roadside-type deployments. Two deployment scenarios with tunable parameters are analyzed, and optimization frameworks are formulated for each approach, accounting for propagation characteristics, radio properties, and antenna directionality. The evaluation metrics not only assess the performance of each technology (IAB and RIS) but also consider the deployment costs required to achieve equivalent performance levels. Numerical results show that both RIS- and IAB-based deployments can effectively support multicast and unicast traffic, with IAB systems demonstrating superior performance in terms of overall resource utilization up to 50% in sparse deployment scenarios. Instead, in highly dense deployment scenarios, RISs exhibit superior scalability and resource efficiency compared to IABs, achieving up to a 3 times improvement factor. Furthermore, unlike IAB deployments, the performance of RIS-based systems continuously improves as the number of RIS nodes increases. From a capital expenditure perspective, RIS deployments prove to be more cost-efficient than IAB systems, provided that the unit cost of RIS is lower.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of mobile devices within Internet of Things (IoT) has substantially heightened the demand for mobile edge computing (MEC). Fog computing (FC) is a more advanced form of edge computing that allows computing nodes to cooperate with each other. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a critical technology for optimizing wireless communication environments, attracting considerable attention. In this paper, we develop an online optimization problem for RIS-aided mobile FC deployed across wireless networks with computing nodes at the base stations (BS). We propose a Lyapunov-drift-plus-penalty-based, space aggregation-assisted proximal policy optimization (LSAPPO) algorithm to tackle the challenges in online optimization problem in RIS-aided mobile FC system. Our technique integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm employing the proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent, further enhanced by Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization. The space aggregation technique effectively consolidates excessive decision variables and channel state information (CSI) into a manageable set of parameters to streamline the computing framework. Numerical simulation result shows that our proposed algorithm surpasses the benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness in complicated wireless networks. Furthermore, we introduce the multi-agent LSAPPO algorithm to address the distributed demands of practical scenarios. The multi-agent LSAPPO algorithm enhances convergence speed and performs better in large-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) can be often distributed, owing to the need to harness more resources and/or to preserve privacy. Accordingly, distributed learning has received significant attention from the literature; however, most works focus on the expected learning quality (e.g., loss) attained and do not consider the distribution thereof. It follows that ML models are not dependable, and may fall short of the required performance in many real-world cases. In this work, we tackle this challenge and propose DepL, a framework attaining dependable learning orchestration. DepL efficiently makes joint, near-optimal decisions concerning (i) which data to use for learning, (ii) the ML models to use – chosen within a set of full-size models and compressed versions thereof – and when to switch from one model to another, and (iii) the clusters of physical nodes to use for the learning. DepL improves over previous works by guaranteeing that the learning quality target (e.g., a minimum loss) is achieved with a target probability, while minimizing the learning (e.g., energy) cost. DepL has provably low polynomial computational complexity and a constant competitive ratio. Further, experimental results using the CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets show that it consistently matches the optimum and outperforms state-of-theart approaches (30% faster learning and 40–80% lower cost).},

However, STIN features a dynamic terrestrial access layer and an inter-satellite layer; it's complex to orchestrate the SFC in such a dynamic network. In this paper, we provide the Virtual Multi-Resource Storage Time Aggregated Graph (VMR-STAG) model and SFC orchestration algorithms for SFC orchestration in STIN. Inspired by the Virtual Topology (VT) method, VMR-STAG aggregates the dual-layer dynamic topology and time-varying resources into a single virtual graph, thus reducing the complexity of the STIN model. Based on VMR-STAG, we propose the Offline Request Orchestration (ORO) and Online Request Orchestration (OLRO) algorithms, designed to minimize SFC migration frequency, service delay, service jitter, and enhance load balancing. Leveraging resource distribution across multiple time slots, these algorithms schedule the long-lasting, high-performance SFC within STIN. Evaluation and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model and algorithms significantly outperform conventional solutions, achieving significant improvements in model complexity, SFC migration frequency, workload balancing, service delay, and jitter.},

  abstract     = {In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is a continuing concern within autonomous vehicles. Psychological research shows that pedestrian traveling is a cyclic alternation. Pedestrians constantly interact with their surroundings, including social agents and physical environments, and plan paths to achieve goals. Nevertheless, most existing trajectory prediction methods are based on a single-stage design, which runs counter to traffic psychology principles. In this work, we present MPNet, a novel multi-stage progressive convolutional neural network that decomposes complicated trajectory prediction into multiple manageable components, where lightweight sub-networks handle each stage with a divide-and-conquer methodology. Specifically, our sub-networks are based on the encoder-decoder architecture, in which we capture interactive information and estimate goals to achieve trajectory prediction. The communication among sub-networks depends on a novel cross-stage fusion design. We introduce a feedback channel mutual attention mechanism and a cross-sub-network fusion unit to enable efficient information sharing across different stages. At each stage, we develop a symmetric gated supervision module to supervise future trajectory generation from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) by 5.6%/7.4% on the ETH and UCY Datasets, 7.5%/7.7% on the Stanford Drone Dataset, and 7.1%/22.5% on the Intersection Drone Dataset, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Additionally, our MPNet-Tiny variant reduces parameters by 90.5% and inference time by 1.83 seconds with competitive accuracy.},

In response, existing research seeks to identify the unique fingerprints on the images they generate, which can be leveraged to attribute the generated images to their source models. However, existing methods are restricted to identifying models within a static set included in classifier training, incapable of adapting dynamically to newly emerging unseen models. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to develop a generalized model fingerprint extractor capable of zero-shot attribution that effectively attributes unseen models without exposure during training. Central to our method is a model synthesis technique, which generates numerous synthetic models that mimic the fingerprint patterns of real-world generative models. The design of the synthesis technique is motivated by observations on how the basic generative model's architecture building blocks and parameters influence fingerprint patterns, and it is validated through designed metrics to examine synthetic models' fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that the fingerprint extractor, trained solely on synthetic models, achieves impressive zero-shot generalization on a wide range of real-world generative models, improving model identification and verification accuracy on unseen models by over 40% and 15%, respectively, compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Retinal surgery typically requires bimanual manipulation of tools in the eye. Freehand retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a highly challenging operation mainly due to typical hand tremors relative to the small size of retinal veins. Robot-assisted technology resolves hand tremor issues and gives ophthalmologists higher positioning resolution to enable RVC. Bimanual robot manipulation of the eyeball typically requires kinematics-based control to maintain each robotic tools remote center of motion (RCM) constraint and registration between the two robots to avoid scleral injury. Any potential relative movement of the robot base can impact patient safety. To avoid these problems, we developed a bimanual adaptive cooperative (BMAC) control framework. Each robot is independently controlled via a hybrid adaptive position-force control algorithm using fiber Bragg grating-based force-sensing surgical instruments. This algorithm minimizes the tool-sclera interaction forces automatically, resulting in maintaining the sclera forces within a safe threshold and avoiding over-stretch of the sclera, which guarantees patient safety despite the absence of kinematic RCM constraint and registration of the two robots. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through a pilot study with five users in a vessel-following experiment on an eye phantom under a surgical microscope.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic manipulation demonstrates significant potential for biomedical applications. When manipulating miniature robots with considerable mass, either a large electromagnetic system (EMS) or an actuated permanent magnet (ActPM) is typically required to generate sufficient magnetic force to counteract the effects of gravity. However, EMS suffers from low energy efficiency, and ActPM struggles with providing robust control due to the nonlinear nature of the magnetic force generated by the permanent magnets. In this study, we propose a magnetic navigation paradigm that employs an ActPM as the primary actuator, complemented by EMS. This approach enables effective levitation of macroscale magnetic robots in unconfined, low-viscosity Newtonian fluids, significantly improving the stability of magnetic force and reducing the power consumption by EMS. Besides, we design a hybrid-driven strategy and construct a magnetic model for collaborative magnetic manipulation. The required minimal number and the configuration of electromagnets have been optimized. Taking a capsule endoscope as a case study, we introduce a weight selection method for controlled objects, ensuring full controllability across all positions and attitudes within the working range. Furthermore, levitation control for capsules is realized using a specifically designed control framework featuring a dual PID controller, an extended state observer, and a Kalman filter. The simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid-driven method enhances the force stability and control robustness, while simultaneously reducing the requirements for high-frequency position feedback.},

Ex vivo HIFU sonication validated the transparency of sensorized membrane, showing no statistically significant impact on lesion formation.

An ergonomic evaluation of the robot during the handling of the robot by expert urologists, as well as non-clinicians, showed better ergonomics than standard hand-held PCNL devices. Additionally, closed-loop position control of the distal end of the CTR was implemented based on resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics. The performance of the robot was empirically validated through experiments on a life-size abdominal phantom.

A pivotal limitation of this integration is its performance decoding motor imagery (MI) in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing methods for MI decoding predominantly rely on handcrafted features or ignore key spatial and temporal information, thereby extracting redundant information and eventually reducing the decoding precision. To address these issues, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based multi-scale feature extraction network, named STANet. STANet consists of three critical modules. The multi-spatial attention module and temporal attention module enable the STANet to capture more key spatial features and temporal features, respectively. Additionally, the multi-scale feature extraction module can integrate effective features from different scales, increasing the MI decoding precision. To evaluate the effectiveness of STANet, experiments have been performed on two public datasets, namely, the BCI-IV-2a dataset and the High Gamma dataset. STANet exhibits notable classification accuracy of 80.56% and 96.87% on two datasets, outperforming the current state-of-the-art algorithms. These findings suggest that incorporating spatial-temporal attention can enhance MI decoding performance, with the potential to improve the efficiency of controlling neurorobotic applications.},

Methods: For six months, surgical residents participated in three training sessions once a month, surrounding a single 26-hour hospital shift. In each shift, they participated in training sessions scheduled before, during, and after the shift. In each training session, they performed three dry-lab training tasks: Ring Tower Transfer, Knot-Tying, and Suturing. We collected a comprehensive dataset, including videos synchronized with kinematic data, activity tracking, and scans of the suturing pads. Results: We are releasing the dataset resulting in 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical specializations. Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement across all tasks. In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning and forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of fatigue. Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the long-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals and varying levels of fatigue.

The device features a direct-drive configuration, ensuring fast actuation, zero backlash, and a compact design. It also integrates a stylus-based user interface for intuitive laser control, and an adaptive control architecture with feedforward compensation for accurate trajectory tracing. Experimental validation demonstrates micrometric precision, 16 μm accuracy, setting time below 25ms, and a 16.7Hz actuation bandwidth, which enable the device to accurately follow user commands with unnoticeable delay. Furthermore, results of user trials are reported, demonstrating the intuitiveness and high usability of the new device, which make even naive users able to achieve accurate laser steering control (27±73μm) with practically no training on the device.

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) images remains challenging due to speckle noise, multi-layer anatomical boundaries, and scanning variability. For the robotic ultrasound system, the quality of captured ultrasound images highly depends on the force and angle applied to the tissue during autonomous scanning. Consequently, how the autonomous scan is performed influences the subsequent image segmentation task. Particularly, segmentation algorithms for bone structures are relatively less affected by variations in applied force. In contrast, muscle segmentation remains particularly challenging due to tissue deformation caused by variations in applied force during robotic scanning. Existing algorithms typically focus on either bone or muscle, rather than addressing both structures simultaneously. To address those challenges, we proposed an autonomous robotic ultrasound system that integrates precise force control with a cascaded deep learning framework in this paper. Specifically, the Hybrid Channel and Coordinate Enhanced Cascaded U-Net (HCCE-CUNet) was designed to enable simultaneous segmentation of bone and multi-layer muscle structures with improved accuracy. Experimental evaluations on two customized forearm phantoms demonstrated the system’s reliability, achieving a root-mean-square error in force tracking below 0.14N, and showed significant segmentation improvements, with Dice coefficients of 0.8915 (single-layer phantom) and 0.9175 (multi-layer phantom). The proposed segmentation method extends the image processing capability of the robotic ultrasound to deal with hard tissues (i.e. bones) and multiple muscles simultaneously. In the future, it could have great potential to provide a reliable solution for operator-independent musculoskeletal diagnostics and interventions.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiography is essential in cardiology, with the parasternal long axis (PLAX) view key to evaluating cardiac geometry and diagnosing ventricular hypertrophy. Measurements of cardiac structures—including ventricular dimensions and wall thickness, obtained by placing calipers on the walls—are often influenced by significant inter-and intra-clinician variability. The design of automated deep learning (DL) algorithms to address this issue and support clinician with measurements remains constrained by the limited availability of annotated echocardiographic datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to synthesize PLAX images by using spatial information from caliper positions. Our approach uses conditional latent diffusion models, guided by geometric-anatomical priors encoded through heatmap, ensuring alignment with cardiac anatomy. We evaluate the proposed method through a comprehensive comparison of conditioning strategies using specific metrics to quantify anatomical agreement between synthetic and real images. Our method shows superior performance, achieving the best image quality (Frechet Inception Distance:21.08) and anatomical consistency (Davies-Bouldin score:22.97). Synthetic images from our model enhanced the performance of DL models for caliper identification, showing their value in augmenting training datasets. By addressing variability and standardizing measurements, this approach paves the way for objective and reliable echocardiographic analysis, with promising implications for medical imaging analysis.},

  abstract     = {Natural orifice diagnostic surgery require manipulators that remain slender yet sufficiently stiff to preserve positioning accuracy under contact. Stiffness performance directly affects the precision and stability. In this paper, a staggered continuum manipulator and a multi-layer stiffness-optimization method is proposed. First, the structure of unit was optimized using topology optimization to maximize performance. Then, a multi-layer stiffness-optimization model with an end-effector accuracy constraint was formulated to jointly optimize local joint and global manipulator parameters across levels. The global layer builds a virtual-joint-model (VJM) stiffness map over the design space, while the local layer refines joint structure to reshape load paths. Finally, prototypes and simulations show that, the optimized manipulator achieves a 66% increase in tip stiffness while reducing mass by 62%, and supports omnidirectional bending up to 170 angle without loss of controllability. In bench tests with externally applied moments and axial tip loads representative of diagnostic maneuvers, the 3D End-Effector position error is 0.72 mm, confirming that stiffness gains translate into reduced load-induced deflection. The results demonstrate that integrating staggered joint layout with multi-layer stiffness optimization provides a practical route to co-optimize flexibility, spatial efficiency, and accuracy for natural-orifice diagnostics.},

Thus, developing additional, biomechanically meaningful input parameters from these sensors and subsequently informing joint angle estimation models with these features may further reduce model error for limited sensor applications. As such, this study explored the effects of including simple, kinematically extrapolated joint angle estimations as Random Forest model input features when using only historical sagittal ankle angles to predict future ankle angles. Results indicated that including N ≥ 1 KE estimations significantly reduced the joint angle estimation error of the Random Forest models across a variety of estimation horizons without meaningfully increasing the model runtime for exoskeleton applications (N = 0: trun = 1.89 ms; N= 25: trun = 2.91 ms). Near future horizons (thzn = 50 -100 ms) only saw increased benefit from a small number of KEs, while larger estimation horizons (thzn = 200 -250 ms) saw benefit from the inclusion of higher counts of KEs. Such results indicate that this simple methodology may be implemented into some single sensor ankle exoskeleton applications to reduce model error without meaningfully increasing computational demand.},

However, most existing approaches remain limited to in-processing strategies—injecting fairness constraints into predictive models—while largely overlooking the potential of data preprocessing to mitigate inherent biases. Moreover, few methods address the critical challenge of real-world distribution shift, which can compromise the generalizability of fair models across domains. In this article, we propose the counterfactual reflux variational autoencoder (CRVAE), a novel framework for generating counterfactual samples and learning fair representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly consider counterfactual fair representation learning under covariate shift, enabling both single-domain and covariate shift prediction tasks. For fairness, we introduce a Reflux technique that enforces consistency between factual and counterfactual representations. For transferability, we incorporate a domain discriminator to align fair representations across domains. Experimental results show that our approach improves fairness with minimal performance loss and maintains generalization across domains. Furthermore, CRVAE can be flexibly combined with existing in-processing fairness methods. Future work may explore extending this framework to settings with limited causal graph knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot segmentation (FSS) has garnered significant attention. Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the segment anything model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in FSS. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an unbiased semantic decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual–text target prompt generator (VTPG) is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring retraining of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information. Experiments on both the PASCAL- $5^{i}$ and COCO- $20^{i}$ show that our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performances.},

However, due to the complexity of the environment, existing methods still face many challenges when dealing with long-distance objects, partial occlusions, and interference from similar categories. To tackle these challenges, we propose a 3-D MOT framework based on a voxel masking encoder (VME) and a deep hashing paradigm (DHP). We introduce a masking strategy that processes voxel features from near to far while maintaining feature sparsity, effectively capturing global contextual information between spatial features. Simultaneously, DHP is utilized to generate image hash codes and compute their hamming distance from the category hash codes. This process effectively distinguishes between object categories and thus avoids cross-category object dissociation. In addition, we propose a distance optimization matching (DOM) method that uses geometric dimensions and spatial distances to build a cost matrix, achieving more efficient and precise object associations. Results from experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset reveal that our framework delivers outstanding tracking performance, surpassing other advanced methods in tracking accuracy.

The algorithm accepts a pair of ambient and flash images as inputs, and a flash-only image, which corresponds to the one captured with flash as the sole illumination source, is derived from the inputs. In light of the reflection-free nature of the flash-only image, we use it to guide the diffusion model to reconstruct the structures of the transmission image. A feature distillation scheme is designed to infer the chromatic attributes of the transmission image from the ambient image, and the features are used to modulate the generative priors learned by the diffusion model. We use time-aware strategies to ensure the synchronization between feature distillation and the dynamic image generation process of the diffusion model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is sequentially optimized in latent and pixel spaces. We also develop a plug-and-play fidelity-enhancing module (FEM) and integrate it into the proposed model to enable the faithful reconstruction of fine-granular visual characteristics of the target scene and reduce artifacts. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows superior quantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-art methods in real-world scenarios. By leveraging the optical cue and the generative capability of the diffusion model, the algorithm can accurately restore the visual details of the transmission image even in the presence of strong reflections, and it also exhibits satisfactory robustness against nonlinear image representation and misalignment.},

To address these issues, this article studies a self-clustering particle swarm optimization algorithm with modal detection informed classification evaluation (MDICE) to solve ECMMOPs. To deal with multimodality, a surrogate-assisted self-clustering update mechanism is first designed to update individuals in each modality. Following that, a novel modal detection strategy is proposed based on the awareness of fitness landscapes to identify all potential modal seeds. For better utilization of FEs, a modality-guided classification evaluation strategy is designed to efficiently generate infilling samples for each constraint and modality. Moreover, to address the complex constraints, a surrogate-assisted feasibility search strategy is developed to quickly search for feasible solutions at a lower evaluation cost. Experimental results on 33 benchmark functions with various characteristics indicate that MDICE outperforms four state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative training among multiple clients while preserving data privacy by eliminating raw data transmission. However, the inherent data heterogeneity among participants induces bias during collaborative learning, significantly degrading the performance of local models. Existing FL solutions face critical challenges in achieving efficient knowledge transmission, particularly with respect to insufficient information extraction or excessive communication costs, which result in slow convergence and inferior performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel FL framework in a synergy of multi-level prototype-based contrastive learning (CL) and soft label generation, named FedMPS. The proposed method first constructs multi-level prototypes from different layers of the model to capture semantic information in high-level features and detailed information in low-level features. These prototypes are then utilized through CL to enhance intra-class discriminability and intra-class consistency in the feature space. In addition, a prototype-guided soft label generation module is introduced to model latent interclass relationships in the output space. Instead of exchanging model parameters, FedMPS transmits only prototypes and soft labels, effectively reducing global knowledge shift and communication costs. Extensive experimental studies on six publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared to the current state-of-the-art FL approaches.

  abstract     = {The vast availability of free data has been critical to the success of large language models (LLMs). With the widespread use of LLMs, more and more concerns have been raised about the unauthorized use of publicly available data. To protect data from unauthorized use for training models, researchers have proposed adding imperceptible perturbations into image data so that models would be misled by the generated shortcut features and cannot mine information from these images. However, due to the inherent discrete property and semantic complexity of texts, directly applying these methods to text will cause semantic changes, resulting in meaningless shortcut features being constructed. To tackle this problem, in this article, we design a novel Unlearnable text examples generation algorithm via syntax-oriented shortcut (UTE-SS) by incorporating the syntactic structure of texts. Specifically, we propose a syntax template generator (STG) to generate the optimal perturbing syntax for a given category, which will realize imperceptible perturbations. Then, a perturbing text generator (PTG) is designed to perturb the in-class texts with the selected syntax template to stably deviate from the original texts. Along this line, models will be misled to learn the shortcut between the syntax template and the category, so as to keep text examples unlearnable. Extensive experiments over eight advanced Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) on four different natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed algorithm. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is publicly available at https://github.com/libolb/UTE-SS.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have achieved promising progress in signal modulation classification (SMC), playing an essential role in a variety of applications such as cognitive radio networks, cyber defense, and electronic surveillance. However, most existing SMC methods still follow the traditional machine learning paradigm that trains on static closed datasets, lacking the ability to cope with the challenge of continuous data distribution shifts in real communication scenarios. Directly applying the model to a new environment may lead to severe degradation of classification performance on previous scenarios, i.e., catastrophic forgetting. To address this, this article proposes the first domain-incremental learning (DIL) paradigm for SMC and designs a parameter-efficient isolation DIL (PID) method, which enables SMC models to rapidly adjust to new scenarios by extending only a few parameters, while significantly retaining classification capabilities on previous scenarios. Specifically, we first propose a parameter space decomposition-based classifier (PSD), separating the model parameters into a set of bases and corresponding coefficients. By freezing the bases and fine-tuning the low-dimensional coefficients, the catastrophic forgetting problem can be efficiently eliminated. Furthermore, we design a scene-aware domain controller (SDC) to select the most suitable domain-specific coefficients for each sample, thereby maintaining the SMC model’s classification capabilities across all domains. The extensive experimental results show the superiority of the proposed PID, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall performance. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SMC-IL/PID},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have caught more and more attention in recent years. Currently, in some practical scenarios, KG embedding (KGE) models are expected to reduce their spatial complexity without losing much performance to address the challenges of storage limitations and knowledge reasoning efficiency. To achieve this, existing works use one or more large and high-performance teacher models to improve the performance of a lightweight student model via knowledge distillation (KD), thus meeting the requirements of some practical complicated applications. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, obtaining high-performance teacher models is challenging due to high training costs and significant storage requirements. Thus, enhancing the student model’s performance without large teacher models is crucial. To address this issue, we propose Dual-View Mutual Distillation Framework for Knowledge Graph Embeddings (DMutDE), a distillation framework leveraging mutual learning for peer-to-peer distillation between two KGE models with different architectures. In KGE models, we notice that the way of modeling relational directed edges determines the model view of KGE model for learning KG data. Thus, integrating the model views from two different KGE models by KD into a student KGE model can improve its generalization, so as to increase its performance. To identify an effective dual-view fusion method, we design two modules in the DMutDE framework. Specifically, we design a novel soft-label fusion (SLF) module for noise filtering and response knowledge transfer. Then, we propose an entity embedding distillation (EED) module to distill structural features from each other. Finally, we conduct several comprehensive experiments on the standard open-source benchmarks to demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art results.

  abstract     = {In the era of information explosion, clustering analysis of graph-structured data and empty graph-structured data is of great significance for extracting the intrinsic value of data. From the perspective of spatial information, empty graph-structured data and graph-structured data are essentially the same type of data, both containing rich spatial information. However, there is currently no general clustering method that can handle both types of data, and the clustering methods applicable to empty graph-structured data pay little attention to the spatial information they contain. Meanwhile, graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have made significant progress in processing graph-structured data, but applying them to empty graph-structured data still faces challenges because the latter lacks an explicit topological structure. To address these problems, this study proposes a multigranularity deep GCN node clustering method leveraging spatial information (CMDGCN). It converts empty graph-structured data into graph-structured data using the $k$ -nearest neighbor (k-nn) algorithm and constructs multigranularity graph structures based on feature segmentation to extend the network depth to deep layers, thereby addressing the issue of shallow network layers in traditional GCN models. In addition, this study improves the self-expressiveness principle, ensuring that the learned similarity matrix not only depends on the node embedding representation but also incorporates the original structural information of the graph, resulting in a high-quality and interpretable similarity matrix. Furthermore, through experimental verification on multiple graph-structured datasets and empty graph-structured datasets, our method outperforms existing methods in several key indicators, proving its effectiveness and robustness. This achievement not only provides new methods and perspectives for graph node clustering but also offers new effective tools for processing empty graph-structured data.},

  abstract     = {Soft-thresholding (ST) has been widely used in deep neural networks. Its fundamental network structure is a deep soft-thresholding fully connected network (ST-FCN). However, training deep ST-FCN to achieve convergence remains time-consuming or even encounters gradient explosion, in part because the convergence behavior is not fully understood. To address this issue, this article proves the relationship between the convergence of deep ST-FCN and the values of network weights and biases. Theoretical analysis shows that, as the number of network layers approaches infinity, deep ST-FCN converges when the network weights tend to an identity matrix, while the biases tend to zero. Following this guidance, we initialize the network weights as the identity matrix, compare it with other representative initialization methods (Gaussian, He, LeCun, Xavier, and Uniform), and quantify their effects on network convergence. Extensive results on a synthetic spectrum dataset and real-world datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10) demonstrate that initializing the weights to the identity matrix and the bias to zero leads to fast and stable convergence. These conclusions are further supported by additional experiments and statistical analysis on deeper ST networks (with more than ten layers) and other representative architectures (DenseNet-161, ResNet-152, and VGG-19), and more challenging benchmarks (CIFAR-100, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet). This work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the convergence of ST neural networks.

These often overlook fine-grained data features, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that degrade model performance. To overcome this limitation, we develop a new method called fine-grained pseudo-labeling and feature alignment (FGPLFA) to enhance SFUDA’s performance. FGPLFA starts with a gradient-based metric that integrates insights from both model knowledge and data features, creating a more reliable sample metric. To enhance fine granularity, the fine-grained pseudo-labeling (FGPL) module was introduced. This module clusters data based on the magnitude and direction of gradients, allowing for dataset partitioning into subsets at the sample level. The subsets are pseudo-labeled with category-specificity and domain specificity, establishing a multilevel granularity structure that reduces noisy pseudo-labels. Subsequently, the mean-covariance adjustment feature alignment (MCAFA) method was introduced. Features from the subsets are aligned in a specified sequence, enhancing model adaptability in the target domain.

This article studies the continuous optimization problem involving large-scale variables, many objectives, and intricate constraints, which is rarely comprehensively discussed in existing works, due to the coexisting difficulties posed by the curse of dimensionality, selection pressure, and feasibility restrictions. To address these problems, this work pioneers a novel optimization framework, optimization pattern learning, embedded with machine learning (ML) techniques. Within this framework, the concept of measurable order and its corresponding learning mechanism are proposed to extract valuable knowledge from solutions. This measurable order is a general form of those orders used explicitly or implicitly in the existing studies, providing a more flexible means to evaluate solutions for efficient optimization adaptively. By substituting original solutions with their measurable orders, this framework effectively avoids the selection pressure from many objectives and the feasibility restrictions from intricate constraints. Furthermore, two novel ML models based on measurable orders are developed to progressively learn effective optimization patterns from iterative data in high-dimensional search spaces. Leveraging these learned patterns, this framework successfully addresses the curse of dimensionality from large-scale variables and thus achieves efficient optimization. Owing to the strong adaptability and search capabilities of this framework, it also demonstrates excellent scalability as the number of variables, objectives, and constraints increases.

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning has garnered increasing attention in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) due to its potential to reduce dependency on labor-intensive and costly labeled data. However, most existing methods are constrained to feature extraction using a single image patch of fixed size, and typically neglect the pivotal role of the central pixel in feature fusion, leading to inefficient information utilization. In addition, the correlations among sample features have not been fully explored, thereby weakening feature expressiveness and hindering cross-domain knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel few-shot HSIC framework incorporating dynamic fusion and hierarchical enhancement. Specifically, we first introduce a robust feature extraction module, which effectively combines the content concentration of small patches with the noise robustness of large patches, and further captures local spatial correlations through a central-pixel-guided dynamic pooling strategy. Such patch-to-pixel dynamic fusion enables a more comprehensive and robust extraction of ground object information. Then, we develop a support–query hierarchical enhancement module that integrates intraclass self-attention and interclass cross-attention mechanisms. This process not only enhances support-level and query-level feature representation but also facilitates the learning of more informative prior knowledge from the abundantly labeled source domain. Moreover, to further increase feature discriminability, we design an intraclass consistency loss and an interclass orthogonality loss, which collaboratively encourage intraclass samples to be closer together and interclass samples to be more separable in the metric space. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method substantially improves classification accuracy and consistently outperforms competing approaches.

  abstract     = {Link prediction (LP) is fundamental to graph-based applications, yet existing graph autoencoders (GAEs) and variational GAEs (VGAEs) often struggle with intrinsic graph properties, particularly the presence of negative eigenvalues in adjacency matrices, which limits their adaptability and predictive performance. To address this limitation, we propose Hyperspherical Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks for LP (HKANLP), a novel framework that combines multiple graph neural network (GNN)-based representation learning strategies with Kolmogorov–Arnold networks (KANs) in a hyperspherical embedding space. Specifically, our model leverages the von Mises–Fisher (vMF) distribution to impose geometric consistency in the latent space and employs KANs as universal function approximators to reconstruct adjacency matrices, thereby mitigating the impact of negative eigenvalues and enhancing spectral diversity. Extensive experiments on homophilous, heterophilous, and large-scale graph datasets demonstrate that HKANLP achieves superior LP performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, visualization analyses illustrate the model’s effectiveness in capturing complex structural patterns.

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve competitive performance on large-scale speech processing tasks. Two key challenges hinder progress: 1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multitimestep spike firing and 2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce the input-aware multilevel spikeformer (IML-Spikeformer), a spiking transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the input-aware multilevel spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulates multitimestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a reparameterized spiking self-attention (RepSSA) module with a hierarchical decay mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multiscale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates (WERs) of 6.0% on AiShell-1 and 3.4% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by $4.64\times $ and $4.32\times $ , respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency.

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn effective agents from previously collected datasets, facilitating the safety and efficiency of RL by avoiding real-time interaction. However, in practical applications, the approximation error of the out-of-distribution (OOD) state–actions can cause considerable overestimation due to error exacerbation during training, finally degrading the performance. In contrast to prior works that merely addressed the OOD state–actions, we discover that all data introduces estimation error whose magnitude is directly related to data sparsity. Consequently, the impact of data sparsity is inevitable and vital when inhibiting the error exacerbation. In this article, we propose an offline RL approach to inhibit error exacerbation with data sparsity (IEEDS), which includes a novel value estimation method to consider the impact of data sparsity on the training of agents. Specifically, the value estimation phase includes two innovations: 1) replace Q-net with V-net, a smaller and denser state space makes data more concentrated, contributing to more accurate value estimation and 2) introduce state sparsity to the training by design state-aware-sparsity Markov decision process (MDP), further lessening the impact of sparse states. We theoretically prove the convergence of IEEDS under state-aware-sparsity MDP. Extensive experiments on offline RL benchmarks reveal that IEEDS’s superior performance.},

However, the task of breast segmentation remains challenging, due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of acquiring precise labeled data, as well as severely ambiguous lesion boundaries and low contrast in BUS images. In this article, we propose a novel semi-supervised breast segmentation framework based on confidence-ranked features and bi-level prototypes (CoBiNet) to alleviate these issues. Our outputs are derived from two branches: classifier and projector. In the projector branch, we first rank the features by multilevel sampling to obtain multiple feature sets with different confidence levels. Then, these sets are progressed in two directions. One is to acquire local prototypes at each level by local sampling and perform trans-confidence level (TCL) contrastive learning. This encourages the low-confidence features to converge to the high-confidence features, which enhances the model’s ability to recognize ambiguous regions. The other process is to generate more representative global prototypes by global sampling, followed by generating more reliable predictions and performing cross-guidance (CG) consistency learning with the classifier output predictions, facilitating knowledge transfer between the structure-aware projector and the category-discriminative classifier branches. Extensive experiments on two well-known public datasets, BUSI and UDIAT, demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Codes will be released upon publication.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal cross-city semantic segmentation aims to adapt a network trained on multiple labeled source domains (MSDs) from one city to multiple unlabeled target domains (MTDs) in another city, where the multiple domains refer to different sensor modalities. However, remote sensing data from different sensors increases the extent of domain shift in the fused domain space, making feature alignment more challenging. Meanwhile, traditional fusion methods only consider complementarity within MSDs (or MTDs), which wastes cross-domain relevant information and neglects control over domain shift. To address the above issues, we propose a similarity-inspired fusion and invertible transformation learning network (SFITNet) for multimodal cross-city semantic segmentation. To alleviate the increasing alignment difficulty in multimodal fused domains, an invertible transformation learning strategy (ITLS) is proposed, which adopts a topological perspective on unsupervised domain adaptation. This strategy aims to simulate the potential distribution transformation function between the MSD and the MTD based on invertible neural networks (INNs) after feature fusion, thereby performing distribution alignment independently within the two feature spaces. A cross-domain similarity-inspired information interaction module (CDSiM) is also designed, which considers the correspondence between the MSD and the MTD in the fusion stage, effectively utilizes multimodal complementary information and promotes the subsequent alignment of fused domain shifts. The semantic segmentation tests are completed on the public C2Seg-AB dataset and a new multimodal cross-city Su-Wu dataset. Compared with some state-of-the-art techniques, the experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed SFITNet.},

  abstract     = {Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from an already trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes, edges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to comply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten), adapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint by avoiding repetitive retraining. Removing specific graph elements from graph data is challenging due to the inherent intricate relationships and neighborhood dependencies. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based methods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies and additional overhead costs. Our work takes a novel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through knowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is an efficient model-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is divided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with response-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing KL-divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of the deleted graph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements. D2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various real-world graph datasets by up to $\mathbf {43.1\%}$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning tasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance in removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained elements, and zero overhead costs.

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its capability to design neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies (i.e., computationally reduced search configurations). To solve the search stability and searched architecture's generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (referred as $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided, and comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and make the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the proxy robustness problem, we first benchmark differentiable NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers, and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxy settings. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $\beta$-DARTS (termed as Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS. In summary, our search scheme shows lots of outstanding properties for practical applications,},

To prevent such fraud at its source, proactive defense methods have been proposed that embed invisible adversarial perturbations into images, disrupting the manipulation process and rendering the forged output unconvincing to observers. However, non-targeted disruption of the output may leave identifiable facial features intact, potentially leading to the stigmatization of individuals. In this work, we propose a universal framework for combating facial manipulation, termed ID-Guard. The framework employs a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to generate cross-model transferable adversarial perturbations. We introduce a novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) to suppress identifiable features in manipulated faces. The perturbation generation is optimized by formulating the disruption of various manipulation types as a multi-task learning problem, with a dynamic weighting strategy designed to enhance cross-model performance. Experimental results show that ID-Guard effectively defends against diverse facial manipulation models while degrading identifiable regions in manipulated images. It also enables disrupted images to evade facial inpainting and facial recognition systems. Moreover, ID-Guard can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component into other tasks, such as adversarial training.},

Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back propagation. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Disentangled Transfer Learning (DTL), which disentangles the trainable parameters from the backbone using a lightweight Compact Side Network (CSN). By progressively extracting task-specific information with a few low-rank linear mappings and appropriately adding the information back to the backbone, CSN effectively realizes knowledge transfer in various downstream recognition tasks. We further extend DTL to more difficult tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation by employing a more sparse architectural design. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DTL, which not only reduces a large amount of GPU memory usage and trainable parameters, but also outperforms existing PETL methods by a significant margin in accuracy.},

We refer to this missing mechanism as structural missingness, and traditional MC and TC schemes suffer from drastic degradation under these circumstances. This work addresses the challenge of restoring structural missingness by introducing a novel framework for simultaneously reconstructing multiple matrices, called multi-matrix completion (MMC). In MMC, tri-factorization across matrices captures the correlation between matrices, and Tikhonov regularization on each matrix exploits its correlation. This design enables MMC to efficiently handle both random and structural missingness. In addition, MMC is not affected by the smoothness along matrices which makes it suitable for a wider variety of data compared to Fourier transform based TC methods. The alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to solve the resultant optimization problem. The global convergence of the algorithm is supported by comprehensive theoretical analyses. We demonstrate the versatility of MMC through extensive experiments in image and video restoration, and showcase its superior performance in comparison to traditional MC and TC methods.

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images.

Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in vision foundation models (VFMs) have revolutionized visual perception in 2D, yet their potential for 3D scene understanding, particularly in autonomous driving applications, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.},

However, the intricate nature of 3D data representations poses significant challenges in restoring diverse 3D surfaces while capturing fine-grained geometric details at a low cost. This paper introduces an efficient multimodal normal-based 3D surface super-resolution (mn3DSSR) framework, designed to address the challenges of microgeometry enhancement and computational overhead. Specifically, we have constructed one of the largest normalbased multimodal dataset, ensuring superior data quality and diversity through meticulous subjective selection. Furthermore, we explore a new two-branch multimodal alignment approach along with a multimodal split fusion module to mitigate computational complexity while improving restoration performances. To address the limitations associated with normal-based multimodal learning, we develop novel normal-induced loss functions that facilitate geometric consistency and improve feature alignment.

Although existing CL algorithms have introduced various practical techniques for combating forgetting, little attention has been devoted to studying how data schedules – which dictate how the sample distribution of a data stream evolves over time – affect the CL problem. Empirically, most CL methods are susceptible to schedule changes: they exhibit markedly lower accuracy when dealing with more “difficult schedules over the same underlying training data. In practical scenarios, data schedules are often unknown and a key challenge is thus to design CL methods that are robust to diverse schedules to ensure model reliability. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of schedule robustness for CL and propose Schedule-Robust Continual Learning (SCROLL), a strong baseline satisfying this desirable property. SCROLL trains a linear classifier on a suitably pre-trained representation, followed by model adaptation using replay data only. We connect SCROLL to a meta-learning formulation of CL with provable guarantees on schedule robustness. Empirically, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing CL methods and we provide extensive ablations to highlight its properties.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras offer significant advantages for low-light video enhancement, primarily due to their high dynamic range. Current research, however, is severely limited by the absence of large-scale, real-world, and spatio-temporally aligned event-video datasets. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 30,000 pairs of frames and events captured under varying illumination. This dataset was curated using a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory, achieving spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm and temporal alignment with errors under 0.01s for 90% of the dataset. Based on the dataset, we propose EvLight++, a novel event-guided low-light video enhancement approach designed for robust performance in real-world scenarios. Firstly, we design a multi-scale holistic fusion branch to integrate structural and textural information from both images and events. To counteract variations in regional illumination and noise, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection, enhancing features from high SNR regions and augmenting those from low SNR regions by extracting structural information from events. To incorporate temporal information and ensure temporal coherence, we further introduce a recurrent module and temporal loss in the whole pipeline. Extensive experiments on ours and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate that EvLight++ significantly outperforms both single image- and video-based methods by 1.37 dB and 3.71 dB, respectively. To further explore its potential in downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, we extend our datasets by adding pseudo segmentation and depth labels via meticulous annotation efforts with foundation models. Experiments under diverse low-light scenes show that the enhanced results achieve a 15.97% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation.},

In the first stage, a global choreography network is designed to generate coarse-grained dance primitives that capture complex global choreography patterns. In the second stage, guided by these dance primitives, a primitive-based dance diffusion model is proposed to further generate high-quality, long-sequence dances in parallel, faithfully adhering to the complex choreography patterns. Additionally, to improve the physical plausibility, Lodge++ employs a penetration guidance module to resolve character self-penetration, a foot refinement module to optimize foot-ground contact, and a multi-genre discriminator to maintain genre consistency throughout the dance. Lodge++ is validated by extensive experiments, which show that our method can rapidly generate ultra-long dances suitable for various dance genres, ensuring well-organized global choreography patterns and high-quality local motion.

Most existing methods for OOD detection learn a fixed decision criterion from a given in-distribution dataset and apply it universally to decide if a data point is OOD. Recent work [1] shows that given only indistribution data, it is impossible to reliably detect OOD data without extra assumptions. Motivated by the theoretical result and recent exploration of test-time adaptation methods, we propose a Non-Parametric Test Time Adaptation framework for Out-OfDistribution Detection (AdaODD). Unlike conventional methods, AdaODD utilizes online test samples for model adaptation during testing, enhancing adaptability to changing data distributions. The framework incorporates detected OOD instances into decisionmaking, reducing false positive rates, particularly when ID and OOD distributions overlap significantly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaODD through comprehensive experiments on multiple OOD detection benchmarks, extensive empirical studies show that AdaODD significantly improves the performance of OOD detection over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, AdaODD reduces the false positive rate (FPR95) by 23.23% on the CIFAR-10 benchmarks and 38% on the ImageNet-1k benchmarks compared to the advanced methods. Lastly, we theoretically verify the effectiveness of AdaODD.},

Due to the nature of their partition strategies, partition processes can often create many unnecessary divisions in sparse regions when trying to describe data in dense regions. To avoid this problem we introduce a parsimonious partition model – the Rectangular Bounding Process (RBP) – to efficiently partition multi-dimensional spaces, by employing a bounding strategy to enclose data points within rectangular bounding boxes. The RBP is self-consistent and as such can be directly extended from a finite hypercube to an infinite (unbounded) space. We extend the RBP to establish a data-dependent RBP (data-RBP) to generate bounding boxes only over existing data points in a sequential manner, which can effectively reduce model complexity and enable online learning. To achieve this, we design an alternative way to generate bounding boxes and prove the distributional equivalence between the data-RBP and the RBP when empty boxes are removed. We demonstrate application of the RBP and the data-RBP in three scenarios: regression trees, relational modelling, and random feature construction for online learning. Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the RBP and the data-RBP for both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {3D mask presentation attack detection is crucial for protecting face recognition systems against the rising threat of 3D mask attacks. While most existing methods utilize multimodal features or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals to distinguish between real faces and 3D masks, they face significant challenges, such as the high costs associated with multimodal sensors and limited generalization ability. Detection-related text descriptions offer concise, universal information and are cost-effective to obtain. However, the potential of vision-language multimodal features for 3D mask presentation attack detection remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based prompt learning framework to explore the strong generalization capability of vision-language models for 3D mask presentation attack detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates entities and triples from knowledge graphs into the prompt learning process, generating fine-grained, task-specific explicit prompts that effectively harness the knowledge embedded in pretrained vision-language models. Furthermore, considering different input images may emphasize distinct knowledge graph elements, we introduce a visual-specific knowledge filter based on an attention mechanism to refine relevant elements according to the visual context. Additionally, we leverage causal graph theory insights into the prompt learning process to further enhance the generalization ability of our method. During training, a spurious correlation elimination paradigm is employed, which removes category-irrelevant local image patches using guidance from knowledge-based text features, fostering the learning of generalized causal prompts that align with category-relevant local patches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art intra- and crossscenario detection performance on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods typically leverage augmentation techniques to generate different graph views for comparison, thereby learning corresponding representations for graph-related tasks in label-scarce scenarios. However, existing GCL methods suffer from two primary limitations: 1) they use predefined or one-time perturbations for augmentation, ignoring adaptive noise injection during forward propagation and thus leading to suboptimal model robustness; 2) their contrast mechanisms mainly focus on the agreement of inter-graph representations while neglecting the dimensional feature redundancy within intra-graph representations. To solve these issues, we propose Layer-adaptive-augmentation-based Graph Contrastive Learning with feature Decorrelation (LGCLD). Firstly, the designed layer- wise adaptive augmentation method performs dynamic perturbations while maintaining the semantic similarity between augmented and original graphs, which can improve model robustness. Secondly, we introduce an Agreement-Decorrelation loss (AD loss) that simultaneously optimizes the agreement between graph-level representations and the feature correlation among different dimensions within each graph-level representation, promoting the model to learn informative and non-redundant graph-level representations. Furthermore, we analyze the reasonableness of AD loss through the graph information bottleneck principle. Experiments on various-domain graph datasets demonstrate that LGCLD achieves better or competitive performance compared with a series of state-of-the-art baselines.},

Nevertheless, this premise is frequently compromised in certain applications, where each view is organized and transmitted independently, resulting in the view-unaligned problem (VuP). Restoring CVC of unaligned multi-view data is a challenging and highly demanding task that has received limited attention from the research community. To tackle this practical challenge, we propose to integrate the permutation derivation procedure into the bipartite graph paradigm for view-unaligned clustering, termed Probabilistically Aligned View-unaligned Clustering with Adaptive Template Selection (PAVuC-ATS). Specifically, we learn consistent anchors and view-specific graphs by the bipartite graph, and derive permutations applied to the unaligned graphs by reformulating the alignment between two latent representations as a 2-step transition of a Markov chain with adaptive template selection, thereby achieving the probabilistic alignment. The convergence of the resultant optimization problem is validated both experimentally and theoretically. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PAVuC-ATS over the baseline methods.},

Despite encouraging progress, current state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural designs on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of scaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we achieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data sources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to ViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To exclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two minimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for hand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces the network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the capture of articulated hands. With big data and the large model, the foundation models exhibit strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turns the generalist into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation models consistently deliver state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA, UBody, EgoBody, and our proposed SynHand dataset for comprehensive hand evaluation.

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce Wonder3D++, a novel method for efficiently generating high-fidelity textured meshes from single-view images. Recent methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have shown the potential to recover 3D geometry from 2D diffusion priors, but they typically suffer from time-consuming per-shape optimization and inconsistent geometry. In contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric details. To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of single-view reconstruction tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To ensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and modalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that drives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only about 3 minute in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency compared to prior works.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) remains a significant challenge due to the sensitivity of models to both hyperparameter selection and weight initialization. Existing approaches typically address these two factors independently, which often leads to limiting adaptability and overall effectiveness. In this paper, we present a novel meta-learning framework that jointly recommends hyperparameters and initial weights by leveraging dataset similarity. Our method begins by extracting meta-features from a collection of historical datasets. For a given query dataset, similarity is computed based on distances in the meta-feature space, and the most similar historical datasets are used to recommend the underlying parameter configurations. To capture the diverse characteristics of image datasets, we introduce two complementary types of meta-features. The first, referred to as shallow or visible meta-features, comprises five groups of statistical measures that summarize color and texture information. The second, termed deep or invisible meta-features, consists of 512 descriptors extracted from a convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. We evaluated our framework in 105 real-world image classification tasks, using 75 datasets for historical modeling and 30 for querying. Experimental results with both vision transformers and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of dataset-driven parameter recommendation in deep learning.},

Previous works have typically relied on domain-specific solutions to address accuracy and robustness issues in those applications. In this paper, we present a unified framework for a number of foreground segmentation tasks without any task-specific designs. We take inspiration from the widely-used pre-training and then prompt tuning protocols in NLP and propose a new visual prompting model, named Explicit Visual Prompting (EVP). Different from the previous visual prompting which is typically a dataset-level implicit embedding, our key insight is to enforce the tunable parameters focusing on the explicit visual content from each individual image, i.e., the features from frozen patch embeddings and high-frequency components. Our method freezes a pre-trained model and then learns task-specific knowledge using a few extra parameters. Despite introducing only a small number of tunable parameters, EVP achieves superior performance than full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Experiments in fourteen datasets across five tasks show the proposed method outperforms other task-specific methods while being considerably simple. The proposed method demonstrates the scalability in different architectures,pre-trained weights, and tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/NiFangBaAGe/Explicit-Visual-Prompt.},

Recent advancements have aimed to accelerate SpMM by harnessing the powerful Tensor Cores found in modern GPUs. However, despite these efforts, existing methods frequently encounter performance degradation when ported across different Tensor Core architectures. Recognizing that scalable SpMM across multiple generations of Tensor Cores relies on the effective use of general-purpose instructions, we have meticulously developed a SpMM library named SSpMM. However, a significant conflict exists between granularity and performance in current Tensor Core instructions. To resolve this, we introduce the innovative Transpose Mapping Scheme, which elegantly implements fine-grained kernels using coarse-grained instructions. Additionally, we propose the Register Shuffle Method to further enhance performance. Finally, we introduce Sparse Vector Compression, a technique that ensures our kernels are scalable with both structured and unstructured sparsity. Our experimental results, conducted on four generations of Tensor Core GPUs using over 3,000 sparse matrices from well established matrix collections, demonstrate that SSpMM achieves an average speedup of 2.04×, 2.81×, 2.07×, and 1.87×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SpMM solution. Furthermore, we have integrated SSpMM into PyTorch, achieving a 1.81× speedup in end-to-end Transformer inference compared to cuDNN.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing allows app vendors to store popular data on edge servers, enabling users to retrieve data with low latency. However, edge servers may become unavailable at runtime due to expected exceptions. Data requests are routed to cloud servers, resulting in increased data retrieval latency. To address this issue, erasure coding (EC) has been employed to improve data availability, aiming to ensure full data access for all the users in an edge storage system (ESS). However, in real-world scenarios, data popularity differs and varies. Existing approaches for edge data placement place coded blocks across the entire system without considering data popularity. As a result, they often suffer from high data retrieval latency. In addition, they are designed to process data items individually. Data placed earlier will limit the placement options for subsequent files because edge servers with the most neighbors in the system can be easily exhausted. Some files cannot be placed properly to accommodate user demands. This increases users' data retrieval latency further. This paper tries to study the placement of multiple files in an edge storage system, considering their popularity. We first model the edge data placement (EDP) problem as a mixed-integer programming problem and prove its $\mathcal {NP}$-hardness. Then, we present an optimal algorithm named EDP-O, decoupling the EDP problem into three convex optimization subproblems for solving with an iterative algorithm. In addition, we propose an approximation algorithm named EDP-A that quickly solves the EDP problem in large-scale scenarios with a guaranteed approximation ratio of $\ln N$. The results of experiments conducted on a real-world dataset show that EDP-O and EDP-A reduce the average data retrieval latency against four representative approaches by an average of 18.4% and 15.6% in small-scale scenarios. EDP-A reduces the average data retrieval latency against four representative approaches by an average of 54.7% and reduces the data discard rate by an average of 34.9% in large-scale scenarios.},

  abstract     = {NVMe SSDs have become mainstream storage devices thanks to their compact size and ultra-low latency. It has been observed that the impact of interference among all concurrently running streams (i.e., I/O workloads) on their overall responsiveness differs significantly, thus leading to unfairness. The intensity and access locality of streams are the primary factors contributing to interference. A small-sized data cache is commonly equipped in the front-end of SSDs to improve I/O performance and extend the device's lifetime. The degree of parallelism at this level, however, is limited compared to that of the SSD back end, which consists of multiple channels, chips, and planes. Therefore, the impact of interference can be more significant at the data cache level. In this paper, we propose a cache division management scheme that not only contributes to fairness but also boosts I/O responsiveness across all workloads in NVMe SSDs. Specifically, our proposal supports long-term data cache partitioning and short-term cache adjustment with global sharing, ensuring better fairness and further enhancing cache utilization efficiency in multi-stream scenarios. Trace-driven simulation experiments show that our proposal improves fairness by an average of 66.0% and reduces overall I/O response time by between 3.8% and 18.0%, compared to existing cache management schemes for NVMe SSDs.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of AIoT devices brings huge demands for DNNs deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, the intensive computation and high memory footprint of DNN inference make it difficult for the AIoT devices to execute the inference tasks efficiently. In many widely deployed AIoT use cases, multiple local AIoT devices launch DNN inference tasks randomly. Although local collaborative inference has been proposed to accelerate DNN inference on local devices with limited resources, multitasking local collaborative inference, which is common in AIoT scenarios, has not been fully studied in previous works. We consider multitasking local client-server collaborative inference (MLCCI), which achieves efficient DNN inference by offloading the inference tasks from multiple AIoT devices to a more powerful local server with parallel pipelined execution streams through Wi-Fi 6. Our optimization goal is to minimize the mean end-to-end latency of MLCCI. Based on the experiment results, we identify three key challenges: high communication costs, high model initialization latency, and congestion delay brought by task interference. We analyze congestion delay in MLCCI and its stochastic fluctuations with queuing theory and propose Chorus, a high-performance adaptive MLCCI framework for AIoT devices, to minimize the mean end-to-end latency of MLCCI against stochastic congestion delay. Chorus generates communication-efficient model partitions with heuristic search, uses a prefetch-enabled two-level LRU cache to accelerate model initialization on the server, reduces congestion delay and its short-term fluctuations with execution stream allocation based on the cross-entropy method, and finally achieves efficient computation offloading with reinforcement learning. We established a system prototype, which statistically simulated many virtual clients with limited physical client devices to conduct performance evaluations, for Chorus with real devices. The evaluation results for various workload levels show that Chorus achieved an average of $1.4\times$, $1.3\times$, and $2\times$ speedup over client-only inference, and server-only inference with LRU and MLSH, respectively.},

However, existing blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and efficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly complex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select appropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing perception-based controllers still present several practical limitations, including a complex multisensor deployment system and expensive computing resource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering Risky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to dynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks. During the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by selectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass, friction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable directly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed three foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds. More importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce the drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one LiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The experimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky terrain tasks.},

Many methods directly filter out dynamic objects, resulting in incomplete scene reconstruction and limited accuracy of camera localization. The other works express dynamic objects by point clouds, sparse joints, or coarse meshes, which fails to provide a photo-realistic representation. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a photo-realistic and geometry-aware RGB-D SLAM method based on Gaussian splatting. Our method is composed of three main modules to 1) map the dynamic foreground including non-rigid humans/quadrupeds and rigid items, 2) reconstruct the static background, and 3) localize the camera. To map the foreground, we focus on modeling the deformations and/or motions. We consider the shape priors of humans/quadrupeds and exploit the geometric and appearance constraints of dynamic Gaussians. For background mapping, we design an optimization strategy between neighboring local maps by integrating appearance constraint into geometric alignment. As to camera localization, we leverage both static background and dynamic foreground to increase the number of observations and introduce more constraints. We explore the geometric and appearance constraints by associating 3D Gaussians with 2D optical flows and pixel patches. Experiments on extensive realworld datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms stateof-the-art approaches in terms of camera localization and scene mapping.},

The proposed methodology features the development of a Collaborative Climbing Robot Squad (CCRobot-S), which builds upon the design principles of the previous CCRobot series. In this study, CCRobot-S implements a parallel-type cable-driven manipulation design, allowing for reconfigurable kinematic morphology by its movable anchor bases and realizing the capacity of crossing over the stay cables for its flying platform. The collaborative robot squad design liberates the dimensions and scales of the robot's reachable workspace and moves the part of the robotic system that indeed needs to be moved, enhancing the working efficiency and climbing agility. This strategy also utilizes controllable adhesion instead of friction to interact with the bridge cable surface for the flying platform, realizing force multiplication for forceful manipulation. Toward bringing high efficiency and heavy-duty capacity, we propose the applicable climbing frameworks (zero-downtime climbing gait for cable inspection and spider-like climbing gait for cable maintenance) and the optimization frameworks (optimal anchor configuration for the movable anchor bases and optimal grasp arrangement for the flying gripper). This article includes the exploration of the design and climbing gaits of CCRobotS, the formulation of the CCRobot-S model, a comprehensive analysis of its workspace, and its climbing strategy and optimization.

  abstract     = {LiDAR point cloud is essential for autonomous vehicles, but motion distortions from dynamic objects degrade the data quality. While previous work has considered distortions caused by ego motion, distortions caused by other moving objects remain largely overlooked, leading to errors in object shape and position. This distortion is particularly pronounced in high-speed environments such as highways and in multi-LiDAR configurations, a common setup for heavy vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce HiMo, a pipeline that repurposes scene flow estimation for non-ego motion compensation, correcting the representation of dynamic objects in point clouds. During the development of HiMo, we observed that existing self-supervised scene flow estimators often produce degenerate or inconsistent estimates under high-speed distortion. We further propose SeFlow++, a real-time scene flow estimator that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scene flow and motion compensation. Since well-established motion distortion metrics are absent in the literature, we introduce two evaluation metrics: compensation accuracy at a point level and shape similarity of objects. We validate HiMo through extensive experiments on Argoverse 2, ZOD and a newly collected real-world dataset featuring highway driving and multi-LiDAR-equipped heavy vehicles. Our findings show that HiMo improves the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of dynamic objects in LiDAR point clouds, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation and 3D detection.

  abstract     = {To empower mobile robots with usable maps as well as highest state estimation accuracy and robustness, we present OKVIS2-X: a state-of-the-art multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system building dense volumetric occupancy maps, while scalable to large environments and operating in realtime. Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities: visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against stateof-the-art alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark, while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the art accuracy in the diverse and large-scale sequences from the VBR dataset.

  abstract     = {Most of today's SLAM approaches learn the map of the environment in the first stage (referred to as mapping) and subsequently use this static map for planning and navigation. This method is suboptimal in dynamic contexts because changes in the environment can result in poor performance of the localization components essential for loop closure detection and relocalization. To address the limitations of the mapping-navigation dualism, continual SLAM has been proposed, which focuses on methods that can continually update the knowledge of the environment and the corresponding map. However, continual SLAM poses challenges, particularly for real-time navigation of large maps, and many of the existing techniques are not yet mature for practical application. In this paper, we present a continual learning approach aimed at accurate and efficient robot localization on large maps, advancing the goal of continual SLAM. Our approach incrementally trains a region prediction neural network to recognize familiar places and preselect a subset of map nodes for localization and map optimization. We integrate this method into RTAB-Map, a well-known graph-based SLAM system, and validate its practical applicability through assessments on several real-world SLAM datasets.},

To address the NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature analyses.

  abstract     = {Impedance control is a widely adopted approach that ensures the compliant behavior of robot manipulators as they interact with their environment according to specifically designed dynamics. For tasks involving six degrees of freedom (DoF), it is crucial to appropriately manage the position and orientation of the end-effector by controlling dynamic behavior. However, describing orientational displacement and designing the corresponding rotational impedance can be challenging, especially when we use a minimal representation. The well-known minimal representation for orientation, the Euler angle, suffers from representation singularity. As a remedy, the quaternion or dual quaternion can be an alternative, but with non-minimal representations. This lack of minimal representation, which does not suffer from the representation singularity, often leads to handling the impedance design by directly defining the potential energy function in the matrix Lie group. This paper proposes a framework for the six-DoF impedance control design that takes advantage of Lie group theory with minimal representation, known as the exponential coordinate. Since the exponential coordinate can be treated as the Euclidean variable within the injectivity radius, it allows for the formulation of the impedance control more systematically and familiarly. In our framework, a detour strategy is utilized; the impedance is designed in the Lie group $SE(3)$, and the control is designed in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak {se}(3)$, which is isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb {R}^{6}$. The group structure of $SE(3)$ can be maintained using the proposed conversion formula between the Lie group and the Lie algebra, called the differential of the exponential map and its time derivative, with a closed-form expression. Experiments with a 6-DoF robot manipulator verified that the proposed impedance control framework effectively reflects the $SE(3)$ group structure and achieves the desired dynamic behavior as the functionality of the impedance control with minimal parameters.},

Existing multi-contact planners often fail to find feasible sequences within a limited time in complex scenarios and to ensure physical possibility. We propose a parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based planner that leverages multi-constraint reachability to efficiently generate physically valid contact sequences. The method accelerates planning through a hash-driven parallel approach, prioritizing promising candidates while pruning trapped nodes via valueless node evaluation. It employs depth-first backup for long-horizon planning and uses virtual loss to balance parallel exploration. To ensure feasible transitions between contact states, we establish comprehensive reachability conditions for multi-legged robots, incorporating stability, collision avoidance, kinematics, joint torques, and contact constraints into the planning framework. In experiments in sparse foothold environments, our planner outperforms mainstream contact planning approaches in traversability, solution quality and physical feasibility, while achieving a competitive planning speed. Furthermore, simulation and hardware validation on hexapod and humanoid robots exhibit successful locomotion across various terrains while satisfying constraints.},

The decision-making network employs the trained feature encoder to extract structural information of the environment and integrates it with a topological map constructed based on geometric distance. By leveraging this topological map representation, we apply topological graph matching to assign corresponding boundary points to each robot as long-term goal points.

The GNN enables collaboration in the robot swarm by computing what information to communicate with nearby robots and how to incorporate received information. Evaluations show that the LPAC models—trained using imitation learning—outperform standard decentralized and centralized coverage control algorithms. The learned policy generalizes to environments different from the training dataset, transfers to larger environments with more robots, and is robust to noisy position estimates.

The presence of such transitions results in all subnet systems being divided into two types: dangerous subnet systems and nondangerous subnet systems. Second, based on the number of nondangerous subnets consistently operated, the more general definitions of strongly robust, weakly robust, and nonrobust markings are established. Third, generalized reduced reachability graphs (R2Gs) are constructed to provide a formal tool for robustness analysis. An algorithm is formulated to compute the maximum nondangerous elementary circuits (NDE circuits) for each marking in generalized R2G. Subsequently, by analyzing the transitions involved in the maximum NDE circuits, we derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the robustness of markings.

  abstract     = {The increasing structural and operational interdependencies between power distribution networks (PDNs) and district heating networks (DHNs) have intensified the need for integrated and resilient contingency management strategies. This necessitates the development of advanced analytical frameworks for probabilistic N-1 and N-k security assessments that capture the temporal and spatial coupling of these networks throughout all phases of resilient operations. Owing to this necessity, this article proposes a novel contingency multicriteria assessment framework to quantify the interdependencies between the resilience of PDNs and DHNs, incorporating various phases of contingency chains. The methodology utilizes the simultaneous evaluation of criteria and alternatives (SECA) approach to systematically rank critical contingencies, thereby revealing the most severe potential cascading failures that threaten energy security. The following stage entails the presentation of a pioneering spatiotemporal cascading failure analytical model, which is developed to coordinate the withstand-and-recover phases across interdependent PDNs and DHNs. This model is supported by tailored operational resilience key performance indicators (KPIs) that trace power-induced heating service degradation across diverse backup configurations, including line-pack storage, energy storage systems (ESSs), and integrated demand–response programs (DRPs). As another unattainable novelty, the developed decision-making framework integrates static and dynamic resilience analyses to provide an all-encompassing comprehension of the integrated PDNs and DHNs’ resilience. The proposed framework is validated through co-simulation of a modified IEEE 33-bus PDN and a 32-node DHN, employing analytical and empirical methodologies. The results indicate that the strategic implementation of backup flexibility resources, when synchronized with DHN service provision, can enhance DHN service continuity by up to 29%, while concurrently reducing the full recovery time by nearly 41%. Dynamic resilience analyses are further conducted in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to evaluate the real-time transient response under top-ranked contingency scenarios.},

Unlike existing results, the discontinuous constraints considered here exhibit two salient characteristics: 1) the bounded constraint boundary function undergoes a jump discontinuity at a specific instant during the initial operational period and 2) the system output becomes unconstrained thereafter. These features render traditional methods inadequate because the derivatives of the constraint boundary function do not exist. To address this problem, we propose a systematic neuroadaptive control framework for nonlinear systems that integrates two novel shift functions with a new barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). The presented control scheme not only ensures good tracking performance under such piecewise and discontinuous output constraints but also can be applied to several other common yet critical constraint scenarios without involving any adjustment to the controller structure.

  abstract     = {The shadowed set, as a three-way approximation model for a fuzzy set, has been extensively studied in model construction, theoretical analysis, data analysis, and applications. However, the current research on the construction of a shadowed set is all based on a single attribute to complete the approximate partition of a simple target concept, i.e., single-granularity-layer space. Multiple attributes are not considered comprehensively to achieve an approximate partition of the complex target concept, i.e., multigranularity-layer space. In addition, the current evaluation criteria of the shadowed set are all reasonable explanations for model construction and threshold determination, lacking an effective evaluation of approximate partition results. Therefore, the multigranularity-layer shadowed set (MGLSS) is proposed in this article, which aims to extend the construction of the shadowed set from single-granularity-layer space to multigranularity-layer space. First, MGLSS is analyzed based on information systems and divided into two models: optimistic-MGLSS (OPT-MGLSS) and pessimistic-MGLSS (PES-MGLSS). Second, the expression form, threshold selection, semantic interpretation, partition rules, basic mathematical theorems, and the definition of fusion operators of MGLSS are analyzed and discussed.

Existing linear or nonlinear internal model designs are inadequate for the output regulation problem in TV situations. Therefore, we first transform this control problem into a global robust stabilization problem (GRSP) for a more complex MIMO TV augmented nonlinear system by constructing a TV internal model. Under a series of standard assumptions, this system can be globally stabilized by a recursive state feedback controller. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the disturbance rejection problem of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) position servo system, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is an emerging and advanced methodology for problem-solving. A critical aspect of RBC theory is agent evaluation, which aims to assess agents’ abilities through a qualification value derived from a comprehensive analysis of their characteristics. This evaluation directly impacts the quality of role assignments. Existing research typically assumes that the qualification value is either predetermined, based on multiscale criteria, or following a predefined distribution. These assumptions, however, are overly idealistic and difficult to generalize, failing to capture the inherent volatility of the qualification value. To address this challenge, this article introduces a Wasserstein-based ambiguity set to model potential fluctuations in the qualification value, drawing on empirical distributions derived from historical sample data. Building upon the RBC framework and its abstract model environments, classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO), we propose two data-driven models: distributionally robust group role assignment (DRGRA) and group multirole assignment (DRGMRA). These models aim to achieve more robust and optimal role assignments under uncertainty in agent evaluation. Leveraging strong duality, we reformulate DRGRA and DRGMRA as tractable finite mixed 0–1 convex problems, providing an approximation framework that reduces computational complexity. Notably, these models are adaptable to other problems with no uncertainty in agent evaluation, highlighting their modeling scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.},

The main challenge lies in ensuring the successful capture of the evader despite the presence of actuator partial loss of effectiveness and bias faults within the pursuers group. To overcome this challenge, a two-layer control architecture is proposed. At the control layer, an integral sliding-mode controller is developed to mitigate the impact of bias faults, and an adaptive estimation mechanism is incorporated to identify the fault parameters. At the decision-making layer, performance index functions for both the pursuers and the evader are formulated based on the PE state error and their respective control strategies, and optimal pursuit and evasion strategies are derived by solving the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Furthermore, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed, with each participant using a critic network to approximate the optimal strategies for the pursuers and the evader. The proposed control mechanism is theoretically proven to ensure that all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, allowing the faulty pursuers to successfully capture the evader.

Then, based on the observer and two nonlinear estimators, a fully distributed controller is developed. Communication among neighboring agents is governed by a hybrid triggering mechanism (HTM) that integrates both time-triggered and event-triggered conditions.

First, the new sliding mode dynamics subject to mismatched uncertainties is derived by selecting the appropriate sliding variables, which can significantly increase the uncertainties existing in the control input channel and relax the strict requirement on the relative degree assumption of the sliding variable. Second, a novel ASOSM controller, which contains some adaptive parameters generated via a three-layer nested adaptive mechanism, is constructed by utilizing the modified adding power integrator (API) approach and the adaptive control technique. Third, the practical finite-time stability of the closed-loop sliding mode system is confirmed by means of the systematic Lyapunov stability theory.

First, a double-integral, offset-free position filter reduces the order of the filtering error dynamics by employing nonlinearly parameterized gains. Second, the combination of the DOB-based system with these gains facilitates the design of speed and acceleration filters based on filtered position measurements.

Using the spanning tree tool present in graph theory, we develop a spanning tree-induced method (SPIM) to induce the weight vectors from preference information. The essence of this method is to extract all possible “key combinations” from an FPR and then compute all possible weight vectors. The arithmetic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM) of these weight vectors are the overall weight vectors of the FPR. Based on the accumulation of squared deviations between the overall weight vector and all possible weight vectors, we define a new measure of inconsistency. The SPIM exhibits three essential characteristics; this method not only produces all possible weight vectors but also identifies their sources. Consequently, this approach can further facilitate the inconsistency analysis, and this method can be directly applied to incomplete FPRs without estimating missing elements. Additionally, we prove the mathematical equivalence of the GM of weight vectors derived from all spanning trees to that of the logarithmic least-squares method (LLSM). Without loss of generality, we adopt the Monte Carlo simulations and report a comparison analysis to provide strong evidence for the advantages and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This framework utilizes a conditional generative model to pretrain a comprehensive and generalizable skill repository from heterogeneous datasets, facilitating skill inference across diverse contexts. This strategy enhances transferability to novel tasks, thereby minimizing the need for extensive, task-specific training. Subsequently, a concise set of task-specific demonstrations is employed to guide the selection process, allowing the model to efficiently sample relevant skills from the pre-existing skill repository, which effectively reduces the exploration space. This approach accelerates the acquisition of highly effective policies tailored for task completion. Our framework undergoes rigorous evaluation on two challenging long horizon, multistep tasks: a standard task and a distribution mismatch task.

  abstract     = {The all-wheel steering technology enhances vehicle maneuverability, while a modular, plug-and-play chassis electrical architecture facilitates the integration of more electronic control units. Hence, this article aims to improve vehicle handling stability performance by integrating the active front-wheel steering system (AFS) and the active rear-wheel steering system (ARS) within a multiagent game theory framework. First, a vehicle dynamics model integrating AFS and ARS control, along with system uncertainties, is developed. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of integrated ARS in enhancing vehicle handling stability performance. Then, a multiagent system (MAS) framework is constructed to achieve coordinated control between AFS and ARS based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC), with interactive behaviors among agents defined. Furthermore, cooperative game theory is introduced to find optimal solutions. To guarantee the system’s stability and antidisturbance capabilities, robust compensation control and terminal constraints are designed. The MAS framework can also address the development requirements for modularization in chassis system design. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments conducted under several typical test conditions. The comparative tests demonstrate that the MAS framework can improve the vehicle’s handling stability.},

To realize the control objectives of the heterogeneous nonlinear signed network, a distributed iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm is developed based on the relative outputs of local neighbors from the previous iteration. Despite the difficulties induced by nodal heterogeneities and nonlinearities, it is shown that the outputs of leaderless heterogeneous signed network under the developed ILC algorithm can exhibit the typical behaviors of conventional signed networks over a finite time period. To be more specific, the heterogeneous nonlinear signed network achieves either bipartite or interval bipartite output consensus (respectively, global output stability) along the iteration axis when the subgraph formed by root nodes is structurally balanced (respectively, unbalanced).

  abstract     = {Personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged as an efficient way to tailor global models to individual data features. However, in real-world deployments, the dynamic nature of client participation—where clients may join or quit arbitrarily—poses significant challenges for PFL systems. We propose elastic PFL (EPFL), an EPFL framework that accommodates dynamic client participation while preserving model performance. Our framework addresses two fundamental challenges: 1) seamlessly generating personalized models for newly joining unlabeled clients and 2) achieving efficient and precise multigrain unlearning for quitting clients. To address these challenges, we utilize hypernetworks for client-specific model generation and introduce a novel client embedding regularization (CER) to enhance generalization capabilities for new clients. Furthermore, we design an adversarial purification mechanism that enables efficient multigrained unlearning at the client, sample, and class levels. We provide theoretical analysis establishing both generalization bounds for new clients and convergence guarantees for the unlearning process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EPFL outperforms the existing PFL methods in terms of both accuracy and generalization capabilities. Through backdoor trigger experiments, we show that EPFL achieves unlearning efficacy and fidelity comparable to complete retraining while requiring only 3%–10% of the computational time of these existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Existing algorithms for consistency-based fault diagnosis are sound and complete according to some correct logical model. But obtaining a good model is the crucial and difficult part. Originally, the classical diagnosis algorithms were developed to analyze Boolean circuits, such that simple propositional or predicate logic models were sufficient to express the structure and behavior. Cyber–physical systems, however, exhibit hybrid behavior, meaning they generate continuous and discrete values that need to be interpreted. This adds significant complexity. Furthermore, modern cyber–physical systems may change their structure over their lifetime and thus require model adaptations. This article presents a novel formalism to model cyber–physical systems for consistency-based fault diagnosis. Drawing from the research fields of artificial intelligence and control theory, the approach models system structure and behavior through the use of satisfiability modulo nonlinear arithmetic. The approach proves advantageous compared to previous modeling techniques through its integration of nonlinear behavior models, implicit computation of residual values to compute fault symptoms, its representation of different operating modes of the system, and its integration with existing sound and complete fault diagnosis algorithms. The approach was validated empirically using two benchmarks from the process industry, a simulation of battery packs, and Boolean standard circuits. Throughout all experiments, an accuracy of 97% was achieved.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the H∞ control problem for networked interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems under limited communication resources. To improve efficiency and robustness, a novel dual-channel event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is developed to reduce redundant data transmissions. Furthermore, a dynamic memory-based ETM (DMETM) is proposed, where traditional static error coefficients are replaced with system-dependent dynamic coefficients, constructed using historical triggering data. This reduces conservatism and ensures better adaptability during transient and steady-state phases, while effectively avoiding Zeno behavior. To tackle the membership function (MF) mismatch problem caused by event-triggered (ET) transmissions, equations incorporating MF information are introduced to establish connections between mismatched MFs. A real-time gray wolf optimizer (GWO)-based strategy, enhanced with local search techniques, is introduced to automatically optimize the controller’s MF parameters, thus overcoming the limitations of manual, experience-based MF design. Compared to conventional controllers relying on expert subjective knowledge or intuition, this method offers superior transient performance and tolerance to unmodeled errors in the system. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in terms of transient behavior, disturbance attenuation, and resource conservation compared to conventional methods. The proposed framework offers a practical and scalable solution for IT2 fuzzy controller design in resource-constrained networked systems.},

The study assessed whether these modes influence operators’ cognitive workload, situational awareness (SA), and task performance. The task involved two LoA conditions: teleoperation (low LoA) and remote monitoring (high LoA), while participants simultaneously performed a secondary task. Task performance was measured through completion time, collision rates, time spent in low LoA, and secondary task performance. Operator-related measures included workload National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), trust, ease of use, and perceived SA. The results revealed a clear tradeoff between operational efficiency and situational awareness. The RI mode improved task efficiency and reduced workload but compromised SA, whereas HI mode enhanced SA at the cost of efficiency. These findings highlight the inherent tension between automation-driven performance gains and operator’s cognitive engagement. The study contributes to the understanding of variable autonomy in human–robot collaboration (HRC) and underscores the need to evaluate both operator experience and task performance when designing teleoperation systems for habituated environments.},

The goal of RPAMP is to orthogonally pack a set of rectangles into a variable-sized rectangular container without overlap, while minimizing the area of the container. By transforming the original problem into a series of 2-D strip packing problems (2DSPs), we propose a two-stage adaptive search algorithm (TS-ASA) to tackle the RPAMP. TS-ASA incorporates several distinctive features: First, a new candidate width pruning strategy is introduced, which limits the number of rectangles used for width combinations, thus reducing the search space. Second, the packing process is divided into two stages, with distinct scoring rules for each stage to optimize space utilization. Additionally, a multirestart strategy is employed to identify the appropriate switching point for the scoring rules. Tested on 39 public benchmark instances and compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms, TS-ASA improves the best-known solutions for 27 instances and matches the best results for two instances. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TS-ASA.},

In the estimation layer, the desired local trajectory is estimated by means of the novel distributed prescribed-time estimators without the undesirable infinite gain issue. In the actuation layer, a stretching function is introduced and integrated with the barrier function to facilitate the error constraints within some partial time intervals (occurring at a noninitial moment), effectively converting the constrained system into a “constraint-free” one. Then, a distributed event-triggered control law is constructed, taking into account the unknown dynamics of both the robots and the manipulated object, as well as communication delays. The communication and actuation are executed at specific event times, thus alleviating the burden of control updates and communication costs of the robot system.

However, existing methods face challenges such as Gaussian primitives redundancy, forgetting problem during continuous optimization, and difficulty in initializing primitives in monocular case due to lack of depth information. In order to achieve efficient and photorealistic mapping, we propose RP-SLAM, a 3D Gaussian splatting-based vision SLAM method for monocular and RGB-D cameras. RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency. Finally, for the monocular case, a monocular keyframe initialization method based on sparse point cloud is proposed to improve the initialization accuracy of Gaussian primitives, which provides a geometric basis for subsequent optimization. The results of numerous experiments demonstrate that RP-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art map rendering accuracy while ensuring real-time performance and model compactness.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable speed and performance in novel view synthesis but suffers from overfitting and degraded reconstruction when handling sparse-view inputs. This paper innovatively addresses this challenge from a learning-to-optimize perspective by leveraging a learned optimizer (i.e., a multi-layer perceptron, MLP) to update the relevant parameters of 3DGS during the optimization process. Evidently, using a single MLP to handle all optimization variables, whose numbers may even vary during the optimization process, is impossible. Therefore, we present a point-wise position-aware optimizer that updates the parameters for each 3DGS point individually. Specifically, it takes the point coordinates and corresponding parameter values as input to predict the updates, thereby allowing efficient and adaptive optimization. In the case of sparse view modeling, the learned optimizer imposes position-aware constraints on the parameter updates during optimization. This effectively encourages the relevant parameters to converge stably to better solutions. To update the optimizer's parameters, we propose a dynamic gradient update strategy based on spatial perturbation and weighted fusion, enabling the optimizer to capture broader contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the problem of modeling 3DGS from sparse training views, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {Redirection in virtual reality (VR) enhances haptic feedback versatility by relaxing the need for precise alignment between virtual and physical objects. In mixed reality (MR), where users see the real world and their own hands, haptic redirection enables a physical interaction with virtual objects but poses greater challenges due to altering real-world perception. This paper investigates the effect of the realism of the user's surroundings and of the user's hand on haptic redirection. The user's familiarity with their actual physical surroundings and their actual hand could make the redirection manipulations easier–or harder–to detect. In a user study (N = 30) participants saw either a virtual environment or their actual physical surroundings, and saw their hand rendered either with a generic 3D model or with a live 2D video sprite of their actual hand. The study used a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) design asking participants to detect hand redirections that bridged physical to virtual offsets of varying magnitudes. The results show that participants were not more sensitive to 2D video sprite hand redirection than to VR hand redirection, which supports the use of haptic redirection in MR.},

  abstract     = {In virtual reality (VR), collaborators often experience the same environment at different visual scales, disrupting shared attention and increasing coordination difficulty. While prior work has focused on preventing misalignment, less is known about how teams recover when alignment fails. We examine collaboration under scale asymmetry, a particularly disruptive form of perceptual divergence. In a study with 36 VR teams, we identify behavioral patterns that distinguish adaptive recovery from persistent breakdown. Successful teams flexibly shifted between user-driven and system-supported cues, while others repeated ineffective strategies. Based on these findings, we introduce the Perceptual Asymmetry Coordination Theory (PACT), a dual-pathway model that describes coordination as an evolving process shaped by cue integration and strategic responsiveness. PACT reframes recovery not as a return to alignment, but as a dynamic adaptation to misalignment. These insights inform the design of VR systems that support recovery through multi-channel, adaptive coordination in scale-divergent environments.},

Specifically, we investigate how 1) idle behavior, 2) AI-generated gestures, and 3) motion-captured movements from a confederate (a controlled partner in the study) influence the quality of conversation and how that partner is perceived. We examined these effects in both symmetric interactions (where both participants use VR headsets and controllers) and asymmetric interactions (where one participant uses a desktop setup). We developed a social XR platform that supports asymmetric device configurations to provide varying levels of immersion. The platform also supports a modular avatar animation system providing idle behavior, real-time AI-generated co-speech gestures, and full-body motion capture. Using a 2×3 mixed design with 39 participants, we measured users' sense of spatial presence, their perception of the confederate, and the overall conversation quality. Our results show that users who were more immersed felt a stronger sense of presence and viewed their partner as more human-like and believable. Surprisingly, however, the type of avatar animation did not significantly affect conversation quality or how the partner was perceived. Participants often reported focusing more on what was said rather than how the avatar moved.},

To better understand this research gap, we performed a systematic survey of current RF literature to analyze (i) how RF is envisioned for XR applications, (ii) how they have already been implemented, and (iii) the remaining research gaps. We collected 365 RF contributions related to XR from computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, multimedia, human-computer interaction, and XR communities, seeking to answer the above research questions. Among the 365 papers, we performed an analysis of 66 papers that already addressed a detailed aspect of RF research for XR.

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a fundamental role in extended reality (XR) applications. As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

Existing labeled resources have been utilized to aid this task via transfer learning, which aligns the distribution of unlabeled data with the source one. However, the labeled resource are not always accessible due to the privacy disputes, limited computational capacity and other thorny restrictions. Therefore, we propose source-free model adaptation task for unsupervised 3D object management, which utilizes a pre-trained model to boost the performance with no access to source data and labels. Specifically, we compute representative prototypes to assume the source feature distribution, and design a bidirectional cumulative confidence-based adaptation strategy to adaptively align unlabeled samples towards prototypes. Subsequently, a dual-model distillation mechanism is proposed to generate source hypothesis for remedying the absence of ground-truth labels. The experiments on a cross-domain retrieval benchmark NTU-PSB (PSB-NTU) and a cross-modality retrieval benchmark MI3DOR also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method even without access to raw data.

A different way of thinking about edge bundling is to simultaneously optimize both the drawing and the bundling, which we investigate in this paper. We build on an earlier work where we introduced a novel algorithmic framework for bundling-aware graph drawing consisting of three main steps, namely Filter for a skeleton subgraph, Draw the skeleton, and Bundle the remaining edges against the drawing of the skeleton. We propose several alternative implementations and experimentally compare them against each other and the simple idea of first drawing the full graph and subsequently applying edge bundling to it. The experiments confirm that bundled drawings created by our Filter-Draw-Bundle framework outperform previous approaches according to metrics for edge bundling and graph drawing.},

Starting with an initial transitional MR prototype, we conducted three iterative workshops - each dedicated to device usability, visualization techniques, and interaction methods. We collaborated with diverse community stakeholders in flood-prone areas, collecting feedback to refine the system according to community needs. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that this co-designed system significantly improves user understanding and engagement compared to traditional tools, though some older residents faced usability challenges.

However, complications from perceptual challenges in Virtual Reality (VR), combined with the ergonomic and cognitive challenges of sketching in all three dimensions in mid-air lower the accuracy and aesthetic quality of 3D sketches. This paper explores how color-to-depth and opacity cues support users to create and perceive freehand, 3D strokes in room-scale sketching, unlocking a full 360°of freedom for creation. We implemented three graphic depth shader cues modifying the (1) alpha, (2) hue, and (3) value levels of a single color to dynamically adjust the color and transparency of meshes relative to their depth from the user. We investigated how these depth cues influence sketch efficiency, sketch quality, and total sketch experience with 24 participants in a comparative, counterbalanced, 4 × 1 within-subjects user study. First, with our graphic depth shader cues we could successfully transfer results of prior research in seated sketching tasks to room-scale scenarios. Our color-to-depth cues improved the similarity of sketches to target models. This highlights the usefulness of the color-to-depth approach even for the increased range of motion and depth in room-scale sketching. Second, our shaders assisted participants to complete tasks faster, spend a greater percentage of task time sketching, reduced the feeling of mental tiredness and improved the feeling of sketch efficiency in room-scale sketching. We discuss these findings and share our insights and conclusions to advance the research on improving spatial cognition in immersive sketching systems.},

Integrating Augmented Reality support into swarm monitoring—especially through co-located visualisations anchored directly on the robots— may enable human operators to detect early signs of fragmentation and intervene effectively. In this work, we propose three localised visual cues—targeting robot connectivity, dominant decision influences, and movement direction—to make explicit the underlying Perception-Decision-Action (PDA) loop of each robot. Through an immersive Virtual Reality user study, 51 participants were tasked with both anticipating potential fragmentation and selecting the appropriate control to prevent it, while observing swarms exhibiting expansion, densification, flocking, and swarming behaviours. Our results reveal that a visualisation emphasising inter-robot connectivity significantly improves anticipation of fragmentation, though none of the cues consistently enhance control selection over a baseline condition. These findings underscore the potential of co-located AR-enhanced visual feedback to support human-swarm interaction and inform the design of future AR-based supervisory systems for robot swarms.

However, the inherent freedom of exploration in these virtual spaces presents a significant challenge for designers seeking to guide user attention toward points and objects of interest. This paper proposes the new technique WarpVision, which utilizes spatial curvature to subtly guide the user's attention in virtual reality. WarpVision distorts an area around the point of interest, thus changing the size, form, and location of all objects and the space around them. In this way, the user's attention can be guided even when the point of interest is not in the immediate field of vision. WarpVision is evaluated in a user study based on a within-subjects design, comparing it to the state-of-the-art technique Deadeye. Participants completed visual search tasks across two virtual environments being supported with WarpVision at four different intensities. Results show that WarpVision significantly reduces search times compared to Deadeye. While both techniques introduce comparable levels of immersion disruption, WarpVision has a lower reported impact on the user's well-being.},

  abstract     = {This study explores how human and AI visual attention differ in a short-term prediction task, particularly in the moments before an accident is about to happen. Since real-world studies of this kind would pose ethical and safety risks, we employed virtual reality (VR) to simulate an accident scenario. In the scenario, the driver approaches a fork in the road, knowing that one path would lead off a cliff crashing the car fatally—as the fork comes closer, the other, safe, path is suddenly blocked by trees, forcing the driver to make a split-second decision where to go. A total of $N = 71$ drivers completed the task, and we asked another $N = 30$ observers to watch short video clips leading up to the final event and to predict which way the driver would take. We then compared both prediction accuracy as well as attention patterns—how focus is distributed across objects—with AI systems, including vision language models (VLMs) and vision-only models. We found that overall, prediction performance increased as the accident time point approached; interestingly, humans fared better than AI systems overall except for the final time period just before the event. We also found that humans adapted their attention dynamically, shifting focus to important scene elements before an event, whereas AI attention remained static, overlooking key details of the scene. Importantly, as the accident time point approached, human-AI attentional alignment decreased, even though both types of models improved in prediction accuracy. Despite distinct temporal trajectories—vision-only models declining from an early advantage and VLMs peaking in the middle—both models achieved low to zero alignment with human attention. These findings highlight a critical dissociation: AI models make accurate predictions, but rely on visual strategies diverging from human processing, underscoring a gap between explainability and task performance.},

These simulations have dials or instruments of varying sizes. Visual information of the objects alone, often fails to capture subtle size differences in virtual reality (VR). However, integrating haptic and hand-avatars may potentially improve accuracy and performance. This improvement could be especially beneficial for real-world scenarios where hand(s) are intermittently visible or obscured. To investigate how this intermittent presence or absence of body-scaled hand-avatars affects size perception when integrated with haptic information, we conducted 2×2 mixed-factorial experiment design using a near-field, size-estimation task in VR. The experiment conditions compared size estimations with or without virtual hand visibility in the perception and reporting phases. The task involved 16 graspable objects of varying sizes and randomly repeated 3 times across 48 trials per participant (total 80 participants). We employed Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) analysis to objective measures: perceived size, residual error and proportional errors. Results revealed that as the tangible-graspable size increases, overestimation reduces if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Also, overestimation reduces as the number of trials increases, if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Thus, the presence of hand-avatars facilitated perceptual calibration. This novel study, with different combinations of hand-avatar visibility, taking perception and reporting of size as two separate phases, could open future research directions in more complex scenarios for refined integration of sensory modalities and consequently enhance real-world application performance.},

  abstract     = {Handheld haptic devices often face challenges in delivering stiffness feedback with both high force output and good backdrivability, especially under practical constraints on power consumption, size, and weight. These difficulties stem from the inherent performance limitations of conventional actuation mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, low-power handheld device that provides wide-range stiffness feedback through a novel dual actuation design composed of two key components. A programmable spring (PS), implemented via an adjustable lever arm, enables tunable physical stiffness. Two electrostatic clutches (ECs) are integrated to compensate for the inherent limitations of PS-based interactions in stiffness display range, rendered object size, and free motion capability. The feedback force arises passively from the reaction of the PS and ECs to user input, effectively lowering both power consumption and actuator torque demands. A fully integrated prototype was developed, incorporating wireless communication, control, and power modules. The results of the evaluation experiments and user studies demonstrate that the device effectively renders stiffness across the full range, from free motion to full rigidity, and delivers more realistic elastic feedback compared to conventional electric motor-based systems.},

Many AR applications such as navigation and tourism guidance are usually implemented in outdoor environments. However, prior research on depth perception in AR predominantly focused on the indoor environment, characterized by a lower illumination level and more confined space compared to outdoor settings. To address this gap, this paper presented a systematic investigation into the depth perception in outdoor environments. Two experiments were conducted in this study: the first one aimed to explore how to eliminate the bias induced by the floating object and how the knowledge of object height influences the perceived depth. The second experiment examined how ambient luminance affects depth estimation in AR. Our findings revealed an overestimation of perceived depth when participants were unaware of the actual height of the floating object, but an underestimation when they were informed of this information prior to the experiment. Additionally, shadows effectively reduced depth errors regardless of whether participants were informed of the object's height. The second experiment further indicated that, in outdoor environments, reducing ambient luminance significantly improves the accuracy of depth perception in AR.},

  abstract     = {Zoning out, a form of cognitive disengagement, seriously challenges the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) based upper limb rehabilitation. As therapy often involves repetitive tasks requiring sustained attention, undetected lapses in focus can reduce motor learning, engagement, and overall recovery outcomes. This research addresses this gap by proposing ZonAware, a novel strategy integrating real-time zoning out detection with adaptive intervention to enhance user engagement during VR rehabilitation. ZonAware identifies zoning out using five eye-tracking metrics: blink frequency, blink duration, pupil size, eye openness, and gaze duration. These signals are analysed through lightweight statistical models (Z-Score, Boxplot, and Modified Z-Score), with a hard voting mechanism producing binary classifications in real-time. Upon detection, a pattern changing intervention subtly modulates task difficulty by temporarily increasing, then decreasing it, to regain user focus without breaking immersion. Three user studies involving 70 healthy participants and 22 patients demonstrated the strategy's effectiveness. ZonAware achieved 98.24% detection accuracy with low latency (82–150 ms), reducing zoning out frequency by 53.57% and shortening disengagement duration from 18.1 to 4.8 seconds. The approach also improved user engagement, performance, and emotional motivation. ZonAware delivers one of the first real-time zoning out solutions for VR rehabilitation, offering an interpretable, theory-driven approach that enhances attention, engagement, and adaptability in human-computer interaction.},

Haptic Illusions (HIs), which leverage multisensory integration, have proven effective in expanding haptic experiences in single-user contexts. However, their role in XR collaboration has not been explored. To examine the applicability of HIs in multi-user scenarios, we conducted an experimental user study (N=30) investigating their effect on a collaborative object handover task in virtual reality. We manipulated visual shape and size individually and analyzed their impact on users' performance, experience, and behavior. Results show that while participants adapted to the illusions by shifting sensory reliance and employing specific sensorimotor strategies, visuo-haptic mismatches reduced both performance and experience. Moreover, mismatched visualizations in asymmetric user roles negatively impacted performance. Drawing from these findings, we provide practical guidelines for incorporating HIs into collaborative XR, marking a first step toward richer haptic interactions in shared virtual spaces.},

There is a lot of work on wearable or mobile AR displays, but little on how users interact with LTTS. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of natural user interaction for these AR displays. To this end, we developed a prototype and evaluated different pointing techniques for selecting 12 physical targets behind an LTTS, with distances ranging from 6 to 401 cm. We conducted a user study with 16 participants and measured user preferences, performance, and behavior. We analyzed the change in accuracy depending on the target position and the selection technique used. Our fndings include: (a) Users naturally align the touch point with their line of sight for targets farther than 36 cm behind the LTTS. (b) This technique provides the lowest angular deviation compared to other techniques. (c) Some user close one eye to improve their performance.

  abstract     = {3D scene graph generation is essential for spatial computing in Extended Reality (XR), providing structured semantics for task planning and intelligent perception. However, unlike instance-segmentation-driven setups, generating semantic scene graphs still suffer from limited accuracy due to coarse and noisy point cloud data typically acquired in practice, and from the lack of interactive strategies to incorporate users, spatialized and intuitive guidance. We identify three key challenges: designing controllable interaction forms, involving guidance in inference, and generalizing from local corrections. To address these, we propose SGSG, a Stroke-Guided Scene Graph generation method that enables users to interactively refine 3D semantic relationships and improve predictions in real time. We propose three types of strokes and a lightweight SGstrokes dataset tailored for this modality. Our model integrates stroke guidance representation and injection for spatio-temporal feature learning and reasoning correction, along with intervention losses that combine consistency-repulsive and geometry-sensitive constraints to enhance accuracy and generalization. Experiments and the user study show that SGSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods 3DSSG and SGFN in overall accuracy and precision, surpasses JointSSG in predicate-level metrics, and reduces task load across all control conditions, establishing SGSG as a new benchmark for interactive 3D scene graph generation and semantic understanding in XR.

Results show that participants experienced a compelling depth perception even from off-center angles of 23°–37°, and largely increasing virtual depth worsens depth perception and presence factors, highlighting the importance of balancing extended depth of virtual space and viewing distance from the wall-sized display.

Therefore, we explored the effects of three AR guidance positions (top, middle, and bottom) within a body-fixed coordinate system on pedestrian navigation in a virtual environment. Our results showed that AR guidance position significantly influenced eye movements, walking behaviors, and subjective evaluations. The top position resulted in the shortest duration of fixations on the guidance compared to the middle and bottom positions, and lower mental demand than the bottom position. The middle position had the smallest rate of vertical eye movement during gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment, and the smallest relative difference in walking speed between fixations on the guidance and the environment compared to the top and bottom positions. The bottom position led to the shortest duration and smallest amplitude of gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment compared to the top and middle positions, and lower frustration than the top position.

Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized mental health conditions, and stigma is prevalent particularly among healthcare professionals. In this study, we investigated whether Virtual Reality (VR) can be incorporated into interventions to reduce stigma. In particular, we compared the effectiveness of three VR conditions based on intergroup contact theory in reducing stigma in form of implicit and explicit attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Through an immersive virtual consultation in a clinical setting, participants (N = 60) experienced one of three different conditions: the Doctor's perspective (embodiment in a majority group member during contact), the Patient's perspective (embodiment in a minority group member) and a Third-person perspective (vicarious contact). Results demonstrated an increase of stigma on certain explicit measures (perceived recovery and social restriction) but also an increase of empathy (perspective-taking, empathic concern) across all conditions regardless of perspective. More importantly, participants' viewpoint influenced the desire for social distance differently depending on the perspective: the Third-person observation significantly increased the desire for social distance, Doctor embodiment marginally decreased it, while Patient embodiment showed no significant change. No change was found in the Implicit Association Test. These findings suggest that VR intergroup contact can effectively reduce certain dimensions of stigma toward schizophrenia, but the type of perspective experienced significantly impacts outcomes.},

The XR simulation replicates the physical study set-up employing a virtual robotic arm, its control interface, ultrasound imaging, and two force-assistance methods: automation and force visualization. Our results indicate that while differences in force deviation, perceived workload, and trust emerge between real and simulated setups, the overall findings remain consistent.

While collaborative and remote design tools in MR have been widely explored in previous studies, a noticeable gap remains in the exploration of co-located product configuration for couples. This gap is noteworthy since in many industries, couples (e.g., friends, partners) often make purchasing decisions together in physical retail environments. In this paper, we introduce MR-CoCo, an open MR testbed designed to explore collaborative configurations by co-located couples, both in the role of customers. The testbed is developed in Unity and features: (i) a shared MR space with virtual product 3D model anchoring, (ii) shared visualization of the current configuration, (iii) a versatile UI for selecting configuration areas, (iv) hand gestures for 3D drag and drop of colors and materials from 3D catalog to the product. A case study of the personalization of a sailboat is provided as proof of concept. The user study involved 24 couples (48 participants in total), simulating a purchasing experience and the related configuration using MR-CoCo. We assessed usability through post-experience evaluations, with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Co-Presence Configuration Questionnaire (CCQ) to measure collaboration and decision-making. The results demonstrated a high level of usability and perceived quality of collaboration. We also explore guidelines that can be used for remote collaboration applications, enabling configuration across a wide range of industries (e.g., automotive and clothing).},

As access to natural environments becomes increasingly constrained by urbanization, technological lifestyles, and environmental change, immersive technologies offer a scalable and accessible alternative for engaging with nature. Guided by three core research questions, this review explores how HMD-mediated immersive technologies have been used to promote nature connectedness and well-being, what trends and outcomes have been observed across applications, and what methodological gaps or limitations exist in this growing body of work. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies were analyzed and categorized into six key implication areas: emotional well-being, stress reduction, cognitive performance, attention recovery, restorative benefits, and nature connectedness. The review identifies immersive virtual nature as a promising application of extended reality (XR) technologies, with potential across healthcare, education, and daily life, while also emphasizing the need for more consistent methodologies and long-term research.},

Traditional playback-based systems lack interactivity and often fail to preserve critical contextual cues necessary for effective asynchronous communication.

Avagents can interpret meeting context and generate appropriate responses to questions posed by asynchronous viewers. Through a user study (N =30), we evaluated Avagents against a traditional playback method and a voice-based AI assistant across two asynchronous meeting scenarios: analytic reasoning and affective resonance. Results showed that Avagents enhance the asynchronous communication experience by increasing social presence, sense of belonging, emotional intimacy, and other user perceptions. We discuss the findings and their implications for designing effective AI-driven asynchronous communication tools in VR/AR environments.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for science education, offering interactive environments to explore intangible concepts. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to convey abstract concepts in science, where many phenomena are not directly observable. VR can address this issue by modeling and visualizing complex and unobservable entities and processes, allowing learners to dynamically interact with what would otherwise not be directly perceptible. However, relatively few controlled studies have compared immersive VR learning with equivalent hands-on laboratory learning in physics education, particularly for more abstract topics. In this work, we designed a VR-based physics lab that is capable of visualizing electrons and electromagnetic fields to teach fundamental concepts of electronics and magnetism, closely replicating a traditional electronics learning kit used as a baseline for comparison. We evaluated the impact of the two conditions (VR versus traditional) on students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Our results show significantly higher knowledge retention in the VR group compared to the traditional group. Also, while there were no significant differences in immediate comprehension between the two groups, participants in the VR group spent substantially more time engaged with the learning content. These findings highlight the potential of visually enriched virtual environments to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge retention of intangible scientific concepts.},

However, balancing the field of view (FOV) with the eyebox remains challenging, constrained by the étendue limitation. Additionally, holographic image quality is often compromised due to differences between actual wave propagation and simulation models. This study addresses these by expanding the eyebox via multi-angle illumination, and enhancing image quality with end-to-end pupil-aware hologram optimization. Further, energy efficiency is improved by incorporating higher-order diffractions and pupil constraints. We explore a Pupil-HOGD algorithm for multi-angle illumination and validate it with a dual-angle holographic display prototype. Integrated with camera calibration and tracked eye position, the developed Pupil-HOGD algorithm improves image quality and expands the eyebox by 50% horizontally. We envision this approach extends the space-bandwidth product (SBP) of holographic displays, enabling broader applications in immersive, high-quality visual computing.},

However, the role of the environmental context, particularly spatial information of user space, in the interaction between humans and LLM agents has not been explored. In this study, participants engaged in counselling conversations under three different conditions based on their spatial awareness levels. The dependent measures included copresence, trust, therapist alliances, and self-disclosure. The results suggested that participants in the condition where the LLM actively reflected spatial information generally reported higher levels of user experience. Interestingly, when the LLM actively reflected the spatial context of the user, the participants tended to describe themselves and express their emotions more. These findings suggest that spatially aware LLM agents can contribute to better social interactions between humans and LLM agents.

  abstract     = {Previous acoustic transfer methods rely on extensive precomputation and storage of data to enable real-time interaction and auditory feedback. However, these methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in object position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These continuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions, making it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render efficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic Transfer, a novel approach that leverages implicit neural representations to encode acoustic transfer functions and their variations. This enables real-time prediction of dynamically evolving sound fields and their interactions with the environment under varying conditions. To efficiently generate high-quality training data for the neural acoustic field while avoiding reliance on mesh quality of a model, we develop a fast and efficient Monte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation, suitable for general scenarios with smooth Neumann boundary conditions. In addition, we devise strategies to mitigate potential singularities during the synthesis of training data, thereby enhancing its reliability. Together, these methods provide robust and accurate data that empower the neural network to effectively model complex sound radiation space. We demonstrate our method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several milliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in diverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and accurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which can benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and advanced audio production.},

Traditionally, AI voice assistants are activated through wake-up keywords, and since they are invisible, their method of appearance has not been a concern. However, for ECAs in AR, the question of how they should enter the user's space when summoned remains underexplored. In this paper, we focused on the plausibility of ECAs' entering action into the user's field of view in AR. We analyzed its impact on user experience, concentrating on perceived social presence and co-presence of the agent. Three entrance styles were chosen for comparison: an obviously impossible one, a possible one, and an intermediate one, alongside a voice-only condition. We designed and conducted a within-subjects study with 38 participants. Our results indicated that while the plausibility of the action had less impact on functionality compared to the embodiment itself, it significantly affected social/co-presence. These findings highlight the importance of entrance design for future AR agent experiences.},

Our approach introduces affective visual cues including line shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines, and examines their influence on both affective responses (arousal, valence) and perceived roughness. Results show that sharp contours enhanced perceived roughness, increased arousal, and reduced valence, intensifying the emotional impact of haptic feedback. In contrast, color affected valence only, with red consistently lowering emotional positivity. These effects were especially noticeable at lower haptic intensities, where visual cues extended affective modulation into mid-level perceptual ranges. Overall, the findings highlight how integrating expressive visual cues with tactile feedback can enrich affective rendering and offer flexible emotional tuning in immersive VR interactions.},

Eye-tracking sensors play a key role in these advancements. At the same time, eye-tracking data is not well understood by users and can reveal sensitive information. Our work contributes visualizations based on visceral notice to increase privacy awareness of eye-tracking data in AR. We also evaluated user perceptions towards privacy noise mechanisms applied to gaze data visualized through these visceral interfaces. While privacy mechanisms have been evaluated against privacy attacks, we are the first to evaluate them subjectively and understand their influence on data-sharing attitudes. Despite our participants being highly concerned with eye-tracking privacy risks, we found 47% of our participants still felt comfortable sharing raw data. When applying privacy noise, 70% to 76% felt comfortable sharing their gaze data for the Weighted Smoothing and Gaussian Noise privacy mechanisms, respectively. This implies that participants are still willing to share raw gaze data even though overall data-sharing sentiments decreased after experiencing the visceral interfaces and privacy mechanisms. Our work implies that increased access and understanding of privacy mechanisms are critical for gaze-based AR applications; further research is needed to develop visualizations and experiences that relay additional information about how raw gaze data can be used for sensitive inferences, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. We intend to open-source our codebase to provide AR developers and platforms with the ability to better inform users about privacy concerns and provide access to privacy mechanisms.

We present Ada, the first open distributed, power-aware, application-agnostic real-time scene provisioning system. Through computation offloading along with algorithmic and system innovations, Ada provides high-fidelity scenes with stable performance across all evaluated scene sizes and with low power consumption. To isolate the benefits of Ada's algorithmic and design innovations over the closest prior work [82], which is on-device and CPU-based, we configure a comparable on-device, CPU-based variant of Ada (AdaLocal- CPU). We show this variant achieves up to 6.8× lower scene request latency and higher scene fidelity compared to the prior work. Furthermore, Ada's final distributed GPU-accelerated implementation reduces latency by an additional 2×, highlighting the benefits of GPU acceleration and distributed computing. Additionally, Ada also lowers the incremental power cost of scene provisioning by 24% compared to the best on-device variant (AdaLocal-GPU).

For this, we implemented video-see-through (VST) AR-based virtual building blocks and hot wire tasks with real one-to-one counterparts that require participants to use gross and fine motor hand movements. To evaluate manipulation performance, we considered three measures: task completion time, number of collisions (hot wire task), and percentage of object displacement (building block task). Additionally, we explored the sense of agency and subjective impressions (preference, ease of interaction, successful and awkwardness) evoked by the different hand-visualizations. The results show that (1) manipulation performance is significantly higher when interacting with real objects compared to virtual ones, (2) invisible hands lead to fewer errors, higher agency, higher perceived success and ease of interaction during fine manipulation tasks with real objects, and (3) having some visualization of the virtual hands (transparent or opaque) overlayed on the real hands is preferred when manipulating virtual objects even when there are no significant performance improvements.

First, we introduce Brain Connectivity Graph Representation (BCGR), an innovative graph-based representation that captures cybersickness-related connectivity patterns across modalities. We further develop three BCGR instances: E-BCGR, constructed based on EEG signals; MV-BCGR, constructed based on video and motion data; and S-BCGR, obtained through our proposed standardized decomposition algorithm. Then, we propose a connectivity-constrained contrastive fusion module, which aligns E-BCGR and MV-BCGR into a shared latent space via graph contrastive learning while utilizing S-BCGR as a connectivity constraint to enhance representation quality. Moreover, we construct a multimodal cybersickness dataset comprising synchronized EEG, video, and motion data collected in VR environments to promote further research in this domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across four critical evaluation metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve.

Driven by technological advancements, digitization has emerged as a crucial approach for revitalizing tangible/intangible cultural heritage (TCH/ICH). However, current research and practice remain limited in their exploration of abstract forms of ICH, such as traditional philosophies and ideologies. In this study, utilizing Zen as a context, we designed an immersive mixed reality (MR) experience system, Flowing with Zen, based on formative study and cultural symbol analysis. The MR system integrates multi-modal interfaces, motion capture, environmental sensing, and generative computing, enabling users to engage with four scenarios through meditation, life appreciation, and experiential Zen practice, providing the embodied experience of Zen. Comparative user evaluation (N = 51) revealed that the MR system has significant advantages in eliciting engagement and interest from users, enhancing their aesthetic appreciation and cultural understanding, and increasing the accessibility of Zen. Our research proposes a novel approach and design inspiration for the digital inheritance of abstract ICH.},

  abstract     = {We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GSProCams is not only view-agnostic but also significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional co-located light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the projection surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and the global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It also uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory for training and is 900 times faster in inference speed.

We validate the effectiveness of p-Blend through extensive empirical evaluations and user studies. Quantitative experiments on a large-scale dataset collected from 45 participants demonstrate that p-Blend significantly reduces re-identification accuracy across a range of machine learning models. While pure-random perturbation fails to prevent attacks that exploit statistical features, p-Blend effectively mitigates these risks in both raw and statistical blendshape data. Additionally, user study results show that facial animations generated from p-Blend-perturbed blendshapes maintain greater smoothness and naturalness compared to those using purely random perturbation.

Existing approaches often rely on point cloud or NeRF-based techniques to deliver realistic representations of teachers and classrooms to remote students. However, achieving low latency is non-trivial, and maintaining high-fidelity rendering under such constraints poses an even greater challenge. This paper introduces LiteAT, a data-lightweight and user-adaptive VR telepresence system, to enable real-time, immersive learning experiences. LiteAT employs a Gaussian Splatting-based reconstruction pipeline that integrates an SMPL-X–driven dynamic human model with a static classroom, supporting lightweight data transmission and high-quality rendering. To enable efficient and personalized exploration in the virtual classroom, we propose a user-adaptive viewpoint recommendation framework that dynamically suggests high-quality viewpoints tailored to user preferences. Candidate viewpoints are evaluated based on multiple visual quality factors and are continuously optimized based on recent user behavior and scene dynamics. Quantitative experiments and user studies validate the effectiveness of LiteAT across multiple evaluation metrics. LiteAT establishes a versatile and scalable foundation for immersive telepresence, potentially supporting real-time scenarios such as procedural teaching, multimodal instruction, and collaborative learning.},

Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in eye-tracking technology have positioned gaze as an efficient and intuitive input method for Virtual Reality (VR), offering a natural and immersive user experience. As a result, gaze input is now leveraged for fundamental interaction tasks such as selection, manipulation, crossing, and steering. Although several studies have modeled user steering performance across various path characteristics and input methods, our understanding of gaze-based steering in VR remains limited. This gap persists because the unique qualities of eye movements—involving rapid, continuous motions—and the variability in eye-tracking make findings from other input modalities nontransferable to a gaze-based context, underscoring the need for a dedicated investigation into gaze-based steering behaviors and performance. To bridge this gap, we present two user studies to explore and model gaze-based steering. In the first one, user behavior data are collected across various path characteristics and eye-tracking conditions. Based on this data, we propose four refined models that extend the classic Steering Law to predict users' movement time in gaze-based steering tasks, explicitly incorporating the impact of tracking quality. The best-performing model achieves an adjusted R2 of 0.956, corresponding to a 16% improvement in movement time prediction. This model also yields a substantial reduction in AIC (from 1550 to 1132) and BIC (from 1555 to 1142), highlighting improved model quality and better balance between goodness of fit and model complexity. Finally, data from a second study with varied settings, such as a different eye-tracking sampling rate, illustrate the strong robustness and predictability of our models. Finally, we present scenarios and applications that demonstrate how our models can be used to design enhanced gaze-based interactions in VR systems.},

Prior studies have largely focused on horizontal or planar interactions, leaving depthoriented exploration relatively overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose three linearly aligned layer transition techniques (Continuous Push, Push&Return, and Tilt&Return) specifically designed to support efficient, precise, and continuous object exploration along the depth axis within depth-based UIs. In a user study with 30 participants, we compared their performance, usability, and user preference across two different layer configurations (8-layer vs. 16-layer). The results highlight that Continuous Push enables faster exploration with lower effort, while Push&Return provides the highest accuracy and is most preferred by users.

Additionally, the virtual character's age affected our participants' ratings of the uncanny valley and likability.

Existing technologies for optical-see-through AR NEDs involve trade-offs between key metrics such as field of view (FOV), eyebox size, form factor, etc. We have enhanced an existing compact wide-FOV pinlight AR NED design with real-time 3D pupil localization in order to dynamically steer and thus effectively enlarge the usable eyebox. This is achieved with a dual-camera rig that captures stereoscopic views of the pupils. The 3D pupil location is used to dynamically calculate a display pattern that spatio-temporally modulates the light entering the wearer's eyes. We have built a demonstrable compact prototype and have conducted a user study that indicates the effectiveness of our eyebox steering method (e.g., without eyebox steering, in 10.5% of our tests, users were unable to perceive the test pattern correctly before experiment timeout; with eyebox steering, that fraction decreased dramatically to 1.25%). This is a small yet crucial step in making simple wide-FOV pinlight NEDs usable for human users and not just as demonstration prototypes filmed with a precisely positioned camera standing in for the user's eye. Further contributions of this paper include a detailed description of display design, calibration technique, and user study design, all of which may benefit other NED research.},

The application simulates the lifecycle of Ascaris lumbricoides and corresponding immunological mechanisms across anatomically accurate environments within the human body. Integrating serious game mechanics with embodied learning principles, MetaRoundWorm offers players a task-driven experience combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and immune system simulation. To evaluate the educational efficacy and user engagement, we conducted a controlled study comparing MetaRoundWorm against a traditional approach, i.e., interactive slides. Results indicate that MetaRoundWorm significantly improves immediate learning outcomes, cognitive engagement, and emotional experience, while maintaining knowledge retention over time. Our findings suggest that immersive VR gamification holds promise as an effective pedagogical tool for communicating complex biomedical concepts and advancing digital health education.},

  abstract     = {Stroke-based Rendering (SBR) aims to decompose an input image into a sequence of parameterized strokes, which can be rendered into a painting that resembles the input image. Recently, Neural Painting methods that utilize deep learning and reinforcement learning models to predict the stroke sequences have been developed, but suffer from longer inference time or unstable training. To address these issues, we propose AttentionPainter, an efficient and adaptive model for single-step neural painting. First, we propose a novel scalable stroke predictor, which predicts a large number of stroke parameters within a single forward process, instead of the iterative prediction of previous Reinforcement Learning or auto-regressive methods, which makes AttentionPainter faster than previous neural painting methods. To further increase the training efficiency, we propose a Fast Stroke Stacking algorithm, which brings 13 times acceleration for training. Moreover, we propose Stroke-density Loss, which encourages the model to use small strokes for detailed information, to help improve the reconstruction quality. Finally, we design a Stroke Diffusion Model as an application of AttentionPainter, which conducts the denoising process in the stroke parameter space and facilitates stroke-based inpainting and editing applications helpful for human artists' design. Extensive experiments show that AttentionPainter outperforms the state-of-the-art neural painting methods.},

However, designing visual accessibility systems is challenging due to the complexity of 3D VR environments and the need for techniques that can be easily retrofitted into existing applications. While prior work has studied how to enhance or translate visual information, the advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs) provides an exciting opportunity to advance the scene interpretation capability of current systems. This paper presents EnVisionVR, an accessibility tool for VR scene interpretation. Through a formative study of usability barriers, we confirmed the lack of visual accessibility features as a key barrier for BLV users of VR content and applications. In response, we used our findings from the formative study to inform the design and development of EnVisionVR, a novel visual accessibility system leveraging a VLM, voice input and multimodal feedback for scene interpretation and virtual object interaction in VR. An evaluation with 12 BLV users demonstrated that EnVisionVR significantly improved their ability to locate virtual objects, effectively supporting scene understanding and object interaction.},

To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy.

Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

This research investigates virtual reality (VR) as a portable safe space for emotional regulation, addressing challenges of sensory overload and motion sickness while enhancing relaxation capabilities. Our mixed-methods approach included an online survey (N = 223) and an ideation workshop (N = 32), which provided key design elements for creating effective calming VR environments. Based on these findings, we developed and iteratively tested VR prototypes with neurodivergent women and non-binary participants (N = 12), leading to a final version offering enhanced adaptability to individual sensory needs. This final prototype underwent a comprehensive evaluation with 25 neurodivergent participants to assess its effectiveness as a regulatory tool.

We conducted a user study with 21 LGBTQIA+ participants and two qualified counselors to evaluate their experiences with VR-based therapy. Findings revealed that the created avatars enabled participants to express their chosen gender identity and increase confidence, acting as protective intermediaries. However, participants also noted how anonymity could affect trust, and suggested that better representation of body language and the introduction of trust-building activities could help compensate for such ambivalence.

Using instancing significantly reduces memory consumption while preserving the full atomistic detail of scenes comprising trillions of atoms, with interactive rendering performance and completely free user exploration. We utilize coarse meshes as proxy geometries to approximate the overall shape of biological compartments, and access all atomistic detail dynamically during ray tracing. We do this via a novel adaptive technique utilizing a volumetric shell layer of prisms extruded around proxy geometry triangles, and a virtual volume grid for the interior of each compartment. Our algorithm scales to enormous molecular scenes with minimal memory consumption and the potential to accommodate even larger scenes. Our method also supports advanced effects such as clipping planes and animations. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach by rendering tens of instances of Red Blood Cell and SARS-CoV-2 models theoretically containing more than 20 trillion atoms.},

Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use — supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).},

Participants read exhibit descriptions under four text-segment length conditions (1, 2, 4, and 8 lines) with or without simulated visitor agents. The results indicated that readability and comprehension were maximized when text was presented in intermediate segmentation lengths (2 and 4 Lines), while both excessively short (1 line) and long (8 lines) text segments hindered reading performance. Additionally, a significant interaction between text length and the presence of visitors was observed. Specifically, the presence of visitors led to increased comprehension task completion times only in the intermediate segmentation conditions, suggesting that social presence imposes an additional cognitive demand as social distractions in optimal text segment conditions. These findings provide empirical guidelines for designing effective text-based information systems in virtual museums, optimizing both user engagement and learning outcomes in immersive cultural environments.},

To address this attentional gap, we propose a design framework bridging focused and casual interactions in behavior-based VR authentication (Casual-VRAuth). Based on this framework, we designed an authentication prototype using a modified ball-and-tunnel task (propelling a ball along a circular path), supporting three interaction modes: baseline Touch, and two eyes-free options (Hover/Tapping). Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively guides the design of authentication systems with varying interaction engagement levels (Touch >Hover >Tapping) to accommodate scenarios requiring casual interaction (e.g., multitasking or eyes-free operation). Furthermore, we revealed that reducing interaction engagement enhances resistance to mimicry attacks while decreasing cognitive workload and error rates in multitasking or eyes-free environments. However, this approach compromises the average classification accuracy of Interaction behavior under different algorithms (including InceptionTime, FCN, ResNet, CNN, MLP, and MCDCNN). Notably, moderate reduction of interaction engagement enhances authentication speed, while excessive reduction may conversely slow it down. Overall, our work establishes a novel design paradigm for VR authentication that supports casual interactions and offers valuable insights into balancing usability and security.},

Firstly, the charging scheduling problem is formulated as a feasibility problem, ensuring compliance with pre-departure energy requirements while considering constraints on charging rate and total power consumption. Subsequently, the feasibility problem is transformed into an online single-time-slot optimization problem to achieve the trade-off between the profits of the charging station operators and the charging satisfaction for the users, without the knowledge of future arrivals and demands of EVs. Finally, a real-time centralized scheduling algorithm is proposed, which can provide an optimal solution for the formulated problem. Additionally, a hierarchical scheduling algorithm is given to address the power limitations of the charging station with reduced computation complexity, minimum data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In response to the intricate and dynamic nature of air combat, characterized by a vast state space dimension and nonlinear dynamics with strong coupling, this paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid architecture rooted in the principles of air combat mechanisms. The proposed approach systematically addresses close air combat challenges, aligning with the OODA concept in air combat. Each layer of the architecture is dedicated to a specific facet of air combat, enhancing clarity and inter-pretability. By incorporating an adversarial situation memory library, typical air combat scenarios are quantitatively analyzed, resulting in the development of a tactical scenario library that surpasses conventional expert knowledge bases in air combat. At the foundational layer, an aircraft's parameterized flight maneuver action library is established based on its characteristic flight curve, ensuring stable maneuvering strategies during confrontations. The Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) model, embodying typical supersonic fighter dynamics characteristics, is tested in a close-range confrontation scenario of one-on-one air combat. The results show that the architecture outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a relative winning rate of at least 61% under similar initial energy conditions.},

This paper proposes a semantic-aware beam prediction scheme based on multimodal fusion. Specifically, we develop a network architecture that integrates the semantic-aware network, encoder, multimodal fusion module, and decoder. The architecture takes environment images captured at the base station (BS) and coordinates text collected from GPS sensors equipped on targets as input, training the network to predict the optimal beam index. The semantic-aware network preprocesses the environment images captured at the BS, extracting key semantic images relevant to communication targets and discarding redundant environmental semantics to reduce data storage and computational complexity. In the multimodal fusion module, we employ a multimodal compact bilinear pooling (MCBP) method to reduce the complexity of outer product calculations, mapping the highdimensional results of the outer product to a lower-dimensional space for a more compact and efficient representation. Simulation results indicate that the beam prediction scheme proposed in this paper can achieve satisfactory accuracy without the need for pilot overhead and beam measurement and efficient prediction with low computational complexity.},

To address these issues, an integrated framework for real-time decision-making and motion planning focused on collision avoidance is proposed. First, in terms of safety, a vehicle motion-based safety assessment module (VMSA) is developed to provide interpretable safety guarantees. This ensures continuous checking and timely adjustment of lane change gap, effectively preventing planning failures. Second, in terms of real-time performance, a motion planning module based on multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and transfer learning is designed to optimize motion trajectory generation. Additionally, a DRL policy based on global traffic features is proposed to optimize lane selection, and curriculum learning is employed to enhance training stability.

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of latency-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and smart manufacturing, has exposed the limitations of traditional cloud computing, catalyzing a shift toward multi-access edge computing (MEC). While MEC mitigates latency by migrating computational tasks to edge servers (ESs) located closer to end-users, the finite nature of edge resources gives rise to complex policy interactions between mobile users and ESs. Game theory, particularly the Stackelberg model, is widely employed to model these interactions. However, existing methods are often insufficient for dynamic multi-user, multi-task scenarios where discrete offloading strategies and continuous pricing schemes are intricately coupled. To address this gap, we propose a joint task offloading and resource pricing optimization framework formulated as a Stackelberg game. In this framework, we develop an Optimal Pricing via Interior-point Optimization (OPIP) algorithm to efficiently determine ES pricing and a Hybrid Greedy with 2-Opt Offloading (HG2O) algorithm to manage the NP-hard offloading problem for users. Theoretical analysis confirms the existence and uniqueness of a Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly reduces user costs and enhances ES revenue compared to baseline algorithms, affirming the model's practical effectiveness, robustness, and scalability for MEC resource management.},

Next, to leverage visual information effectively, the range of the road adhesion coefficients obtained from a residual network is incorporated as the upper and lower bounds of constraints in the moving horizon estimation method. Additionally, a detailed stability proof for the moving horizon estimation method is provided.

Therefore, robust high-accuracy positioning technology is crucial for these applications. However, existing two-step positioning methods rely on numerical solutions, which are susceptible to non-ideal factors, resulting in non-convergent solution errors of several meters, rendering accurate multi-target positioning difficult. We propose a cellular base station (BS) positioning method for UE based on a multi-signal fusion passive imaging algorithm. The proposed approach provides highly robust location services with sub-decimeter-level accuracy and enables simultaneous multi-target positioning. The algorithm decouples the phase difference from UE to distributed BSs into spatial frequency and reconstructs the spatial spectrum by fusing spatially sampled frequency points from the UE uplink multisignal. The UE is imaged as a point target to obtain its spatial distribution information. With the fusion of multi-signal received by distributed BSs, the integral side-lobe ratio and minimum discernible distance are improved, and the non-line-of-sight interference is suppressed, thus enhancing the robustness of positioning accuracy. Compared with the existing two-step methods through simulation, the proposed method demonstrates more robust positioning accuracy under the same non-ideal conditions. Field experiments demonstrate a maximum positioning error of approximately 5 cm, with decimeter-level accuracy even when the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates to −15 dB. Additionally, multi-target positioning can be achieved directly without data association limitations.},

To achieve linearity of each radio frequency (RF) link, it is necessary to configure the DPD separately for each PA, which results in the increasing hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a novel nonlinear distortion suppression scheme combining precoding and predistortion is proposed for maximizing spectral efficiency (SE) as well as reducing hardware complexity and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission systems. To realize predistortion, a partially connected intermediate frequency (IF) architecture is designed, where DPDs are configured for partial RF links based on a distortion power-aware configuration (DPAC) method. To compile precoding, the SE maximization problems with total power constraints (TPC) and per-link power constraints (PLPC) are formulated based on the partially connected IF architecture. Moreover, a local optimal solution is obtained by a gradient projection method. Compared with the traditional zero-forcing precoding scheme, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of DPDs by up to 86.2% with the same SE and the RF front-end energy efficiency (EE) can be improved by up to 39.5% with the same number of DPDs.},

Since ASVs need to transmit measurement data via a wireless network, the performance of the system can be affected by DoS attacks and limited communication resources. The DoS attacks block the communication channel between ASVs and prevent the transmission of measurement data. To deal with these problems, a novel dynamic event-based affine formation control strategy is designed. Then, the stability of the system is analyzed. The sufficient conditions for ensuring system stability are provided, along with the tolerance for the duration of DoS attacks.

The MaxEnt IRL algorithm is then used to infer a reward function that represents each driver's preferences by learning optimal weights for a cost function that describes the lane change behavior. The proposed approach is tested over several real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing personal driving styles under various conditions. The proposed trajectory encryption approach is compared to a benchmark differential privacy mechanism, and the results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate lane change paths that closely align with the behavior exhibited by individual driver, offering an approach for personalization in autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems, the utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing has garnered significant attention. However, OAM beams are subject to atmospheric turbulence (AT) during transmission in free space, resulting in distortions of the phase front, intermodal crosstalk, and mode-dependent loss (MDL). While techniques such as adaptive optics and digital signal processing can mitigate these effects, inconsistencies in OAM mode performance persist due to MDL. Some studies have evaluated an MDL-impaired mode division multiplexing system for non-unitary multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels based on maximum likelihood detection. Nevertheless, the computational complexity remains considerably higher compared to simpler yet suboptimal advanced MIMO decoders, such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) with zero-forcing/minimum mean square error (ZF/MMSE). On the other hand, an OAM mode and radial index are two distinct indices of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with the potential to carry a large amount of information. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have explored the impact and mitigation strategies for MDL induced by atmospheric turbulence in an FSO system utilizing both OAM mode and radial index multiplexing with MMSE-SIC receiver. This paper introduces OAM multiplexing holography to generate OAM modes. We perform both analytical and numerical analyses of the orbital angular momentum spectra associated with distorted single-mode and multiplexed LG beams. This is achieved by generating holograms, incorporating random phase screens along the propagation path, and varying the refractive index structure constants. We mathematically develop and simulate an MMSE-SIC receiver for OAM multiplexed FSO for different radial values for the first time and compared its BER to Zero Forcing-SIC and K-best detectors. Additionally, orthogonal space-time block coding is employed at the transmitter to enhance the overall performance of the system.},

Consequently, the proposed greedy-based scheduler can significantly reduce computational complexity compared to existing schedulers. Furthermore, a novel low-complexity matrix inversion (LMI) algorithm has been devised to further decrease computational complexity by leveraging the order-recursive structure of the MU-STLC preprocessing matrix.

This paper investigates an XL-IRS-assisted hybrid near- and far-field unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with multiple users and an energy-constrained UAV under jamming. First, based on different electromagnetic radiation characteristics of the hybrid near- and far-field channels, average communication rate (ACR) is derived. Subsequently, by considering the effect of user association, XL-IRS phase shift, and UAV 3D trajectory, we formulate a penalty-based alternate optimization (AO) ACR maximization problem, which consists of inner and outer loops. Herein, the penalty factor and auxiliary penalty variable are introduced to transform the binary variable representing the user association into a continuous variable. In the outer loop, the penalty factor can be updated by a linear function, enabling the continuous variable to approximate 0 or 1. In the inner loop, the user association subproblem is optimized first, the XL-IRS phase shift subproblem is optimized by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and then the UAV trajectory subproblem is optimized by successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Based on the outcomes of the above subproblems, the closed solution of the penalty variable is obtained. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of ACR.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the potential of dual-polarized (DP) technology with holographic multiple-input multi-output (HMIMO) surfaces. The primary goal is to mitigate the mutual interference between communication and sensing signals in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By leveraging distinct polarization resources, DP enables the simultaneous transmission of both signal types within the same frequency and spatial domain. However, excessive transmission power will lead to increased polarization leakage. To address it, a robust power control scheme is proposed based on the DP ISAC channel model. In both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, our primary focus is minimizing power consumption while suppressing cross-polarization interference and ensuring optimal communication and sensing performance. Due to the massive number of antennas in HMIMO and the presence of multiple users and sensing targets, the problem becomes high-dimensional and highly non-convex, making it extremely challenging to solve. To address this challenge, a novel differential evolution-successive convex approximation (DE-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Through the deliberate integration of mutation and crossover mechanisms, our approach effectively navigates the high-dimensional precoding matrix space. Moreover, we devise a tailored convexification strategy to systematically reformulate the non-convex constraints, transforming the objective into a solvable convex optimization subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that the synergy of global exploration and local refinement enhances both solution efficiency and convergence speed, particularly in large-scale HMIMO systems. The proposed algorithm achieves better communication and sensing performance with less power consumption. Additionally, it attains higher polarization diversity gain compared to conventional MIMO systems.},

And IoRT devices generate latency-sensitive tasks but possess limited computing capabilities. Our objective is to minimize task processing delays by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, computation offloading, and time slot resource allocation to meet the increasing demands of IoRT devices. Specifically, the proposed problem is decomposed into two components. First, for the deployment of multiple UAVs, we propose a multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradient (MASD3) approach, which enables UAVs to adjust their flight trajectories based solely on observed information for adaptive deployment. Second, for the computation offloading and time slot resource allocation problems in SAGIN, we employ a numerical computation-based iterative optimization method to minimize the occupation of time slots by computation offloading.

However, the absence of an analytical model to quantify LiDAR PPV has hindered effective decision-making in selection, deployment, and performance prediction. To address this gap, this study develops analytical models for LiDAR PPV under both occluded and non-occluded scenarios. First, we model LiDAR PPV as a function of the number of LiDAR points on a vehicle relative to its position, based on laser beam scanning and projection principles, with the vehicle's outline approximated as an ellipse. Second, we incorporate occlusion effects by quantifying the occluded area of the target vehicle. This is achieved through an approach that calculates the overlap between two ellipses, resulting in an enhanced LiDAR PPV model. To validate the proposed model, field experiments were conducted using four types of LiDAR sensors across diverse scenarios, and two data-driven models were also tested for comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed model closely aligns with real-world data, with an average R2 of 0.9790 across 16 cases, and outperforms existing data-driven models in both occluded and non-occluded scenarios. Notably, our findings reveal that actual LiDAR perception coverage for vehicles approximates a Cassini ellipse rather than a circular shape, providing a theoretical foundation for LiDAR product design and deployment.},

TThe effectiveness of traditional SS methods in real-world scenarios is often limited by challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, multipath fading, and high computational complexity. Deep learning-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions by offering superior adaptability and performance. However, existing DL models often suffer from computational costs and excessive storage requirements, thus constraining deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Resolution-Preserving Network (RPNet), integrated with a Convolutional Layer Reuse (CLRu) technique, to enhance SS efficiency while reducing model size significantly. RPNet is designed to maintain the resolution of spectrogram input throughout its architecture, preserving critical spatial details for segmentation. CLRu optimizes memory usage by reusing convolutional layers, effectively reducing the number of trainable parameters with very slightly compromising performance. Extensive simulations on a synthetic 5G-LTE dataset demonstrate that RPNet+CLRu achieves a greater than $9 \times$ reduction in model size while maintaining 87.45% segmentation accuracy. In addition, the proposed model outperforms existing deep models in storage efficiency and computational feasibility, hence presenting it as a promising candidate for real-time SS in next-generation wireless networks.},

The RA problem is formulated to maximize the system's total energy efficiency (EE), subject to the maximum transmit power constraint of the base station, the minimum rate constraint of each user, the minimum distance constraints of MAs, and the uncertainty constraints. To deal with the formulated non-convex problem, we first derive an analytical upper bound on the uncertainties of the field response matrix to exactly evaluate the impact of angle errors. Then, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by applying the Dinkelbach's method and the block coordinate descent approach.

By considering the use of zero-forcing (ZF) fully digital transmit precoder, the energy efficiency maximization problem is reduced to solving only passive precoding and power allocation which is achieved through alternating optimization technique. The passive precoding is attained through greedy optimization in phase, whereas power allocation is obtained by the method of Lagrange multipliers using Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. The energy efficient passive precoding is further advanced through switching off of individual RIS elements accomplished through a low-complexity algorithm.

To address this challenge, we propose a convex optimization framework for result deduplication and relocation (COFRDR) that strategically reallocates cached results while maintaining service quality. Unlike conventional heuristics, our approach transforms the inherently NP-hard result deduplication and relocation problem into a continuous convex optimization framework, allowing for faster convergence and better scalability across large-scale collaborative and distributed edge computing networks (CDECN). We introduce a fairness-aware storage balancing mechanism and a latency-space benefit (LSB) model to ensure optimal storage utilization across edge servers. A rounding algorithm is further integrated to map continuous solutions back to the binary domain, ensuring practical deployability. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in storage efficiency, deduplication ratio (DR), and latency reduction compared to existing heuristics.

Concurrently, federated learning (FL) gains significant attention as a distributed machine learning paradigm. The large number of model parameters and the massive connectivity lead to a significant communication overhead of FL. Recent efforts on FL are dedicated to its deployment in CFmMIMO but do not take communication efficiency into account. In this paper, we introduce compression and specifically investigate quantization-based FL (QBFL) over user-centric CFmMIMO. In view of uplink transmission, we first apply a low-precision stochastic quantizer to model updates for reducing the amount of data transmission. We then delve into the scenario of partial user participation within QBFL over user-centric CFmMIMO. The convergence of the QBFL is evaluated via both theoretical analysis and experimental simulations. Moreover, numerical results show that QBFL guarantees learning performance and reduces communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks should be with great potentials to coordinate traffic scheduling and ensure road safety, where cloud-edge-end vehicular networks have been as promising paradigms to improve vehicle scheduling efficiency according to user task intents. However, as user demands become increasingly complex and diverse, task intent decomposition is crucial for handling the diversity of task intents and the complexity of their content. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in task intents and vehicular network node resources lead to uncertainty in the task execution, which significantly reduces vehicle scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present an intent-driven task-oriented resource collaboration framework, referred to as ITRC, which consists of the intent, policy, and infrastructure layers from a top to bottom perspective. Specifically, we propose a coarseto-fine complex intent decomposition algorithm assisted by a generative pre-trained transformer. To mitigate hallucination during the decomposition, a hybrid hallucination suppression mechanism is introduced based on similarity analysis and natural language inference. Furthermore, the task-resource uncertainty is solved using a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and an efficient optimal allocation algorithm is proposed for dynamic task scheduling. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms compared baseline methods across multiple metrics. In terms of quality of service, it reduces end-to-end latency by 60% to 89%; in terms of resource utilization, it achieves improvements ranging from 5% to 110%. For task distribution balance, the algorithm significantly reduces the variance of resource allocation across nodes to mitigate load imbalance, with the standard deviation decreasing by 38% to 87%. In terms of execution efficiency, the proposed algorithm maintains the shortest running time across all task scales and avoids the exponential time complexity typically observed in traditional optimization algorithms, demonstrating strong scalability and real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications play a pivotal role in enhancing traffic efficiency and safety by exchanging safety messages. However, these messages face security threats and privacy concerns due to the nature of wireless communication and private information they contain. To address security threats and ensure privacy protection, conditional privacy-preserving authentication schemes have emerged as a primary defense to ensure message integrity and authenticity. Currently, the existing schemes either face security challenges or are impractical for the resource-constrained onboard unit (OBU). Moreover, they rely solely on digital signature or signcryption mechanisms. Considering that safety messages encompass both private and non-private information, a dynamic selection mechanism for signature or signcryption is required. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight certificateless conditional privacy-preserving scheme (LCCPS) for V2V communications. The LCCPS scheme not only integrates both signature and signcryption within a single algorithm for the first time in V2V communications, but also ensures efficient and secure communications. The security of this scheme is proven against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks and adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model, leveraging the intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. The performance evaluations conducted on the OBU show that the LCCPS scheme outperforms ten comparable schemes in terms of computational overhead and power consumption, while maintaining security without increasing storage or communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the freshness of data from sensor nodes (SNs) is critical for real-time decision-making. However, due to the limited energy of SNs, the system is faced with a trade-off between energy management and data freshness. Wireless powered IoT (WP-IoT) networks, employing wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, offer a sustainable energy supply. Nevertheless, since SNs rely on energy harvested from wireless power stations (WPS), the uncertainty of energy availability further complicates the balance between data freshness and energy management. Therefore, this paper investigates a joint scheduling and power control problem to minimize the average age of information (AoI) in WP-IoT networks with multiple SNs. The considered WP-IoT system consists of a WPS which charges SNs via WPT, and multiple SNs transmit status updates to a base station (BS) using their harvested energy. The average AoI minimization problem for this system can be formulated by jointly optimizing the scheduling and transmission power of SNs, given the AoI evolution over Rician fading channels. To address the non-convexity and the challenge of an explicit AoI expression, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with hybrid action spaces involving both discrete scheduling decisions and continuous power control. To solve the MDP, we propose a hybrid value function-based proximal policy optimization (HVF-based PPO) approach, which integrates clipped and unclipped value functions to enhance learning stability and exploration. Simulation results demonstrate that the HVF-based PPO approach significantly reduces the average AoI compared to existing baseline approaches.},

A grid-aligned sparse Bayesian learning (GA-BL) solution is proposed for determining the DoA, delay, and Doppler shift parameters of these targets. Further improvements are made by formulating a multi-measurement vector (MMV) based sparse problem for estimating the target parameters. Then, by leveraging this model, we dispense with the grid-aligned assumption, and its gridless Doppler-based MMV BL (GLD-MBL) counterpart is introduced. The latter offers three key advantages in comparison to GA-BL: superior Doppler estimation performance, the ability to estimate gridless Doppler shift, and significantly reduced computational complexity. To further enhance the estimation performance, a block-sparse problem is formulated for the estimation of the target parameters under the assumption of gridless Doppler. The gridless Doppler block sparse BL (GLD-BLKBL) algorithm is then harnessed for exploiting both the block sparsity and intrablock correlations, thus achieving notable estimation performance improvements over the GA-BL and GLD-MBL approaches in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the improved performance of the proposed methodologies across multiple performance metrics. These results highlight the superiority of our solutions over conventional sparse recovery techniques.},

To alleviate this issue, many existing works suggest using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to wirelessly charge WSNs. However, most of these works rely on a single UAV for charging, which is impractical for a large-scale network due to the limited energy capacity of a single UAV. In this work, we propose leveraging multiple green energy powered UAVs to charge a large-scale WSN, aiming to extend its operational lifespan. We first develop energy models for UAVs, sensor nodes (SNs) and green base station (GBS), and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum residual energy level among all SNs, thus prolonging the WSN's lifespan. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we present a two-step solution to solve it. In Step One, we introduce the UAVs Charging Load Balancing (UCLB) algorithm to determine the minimum number of needed UAVs and balance their energy consumption. This algorithm enables each UAV to charge as many SNs as possible, thereby reducing the overall number of UAVs required. Once the minimum required number of UAVs is established, in Step Two, we propose the SNs Energy Balancing (SEB) algorithm to ensure that all the SNs have as much energy as possible, and nearly equal residual energy levels after wireless charging. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in extending the lifespans of the SNs.},

In contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an FIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the direction perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid metasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize the FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel gain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM surface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem into multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD) method for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In the MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM surface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To tackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to traditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels.},

However, the real-time transmission of XR video encounters challenges with high data rates and low latency, particularly due to its frame-by-frame delivery, which is highly sensitive to network fluctuations. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework for the collaborative transmission of real-time XR video and haptic feedback that emphasizes joint source-channel optimization (JSCO). Specifically, this framework involves two critical components: adaptive video quality selection at the source and efficient wireless resource allocation over the channel. By optimizing both the video content and the underlying communication resources, we aim to enhance the overall transmission efficiency and user satisfaction. We also propose a dual-layer deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for solving JSCO problem, termed as proximal policy optimization combined with multi-agent Transformer (PPO-MAT), which operates within a hierarchical framework to effectively tackle the issue of inconsistent time scales. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing baseline solutions, achieving at least a 14.39% enhancement in quality of experience (QoE) and a 67.71% increase in the number of satisfied users. These results underscore the effectiveness of our joint optimization approach, ultimately paving the way for more robust and responsive XR applications in dynamic network environments.},

  abstract     = {Multi-beam low Earth orbit (MB-LEO) satellites are crucial for satellite Internet access, as they simultaneously transmit multiple spot beams to serve numerous ground users. The creation of dispersed beam patterns to avoid interference and the efficient allocation of limited onboard resources significantly impact the quality of communication services. Traditional pre-defined periodic beam hopping (BH) methods struggle with unevenly distributed and time-varying traffic requests. Existing BH resource allocation schemes using reinforcement learning face challenges in avoiding inter-beam interference through location selection and are constrained by action space, complicating model training as user and beam numbers increase. This paper presents a comprehensive framework and its mathematical formulation for efficient BH resource allocation in MB-LEO satellite systems using a multi-agent actor-critic method. To address the multi-objective, multi-dimensional optimization problem, the resource allocation process is divided into two stages. First, the optimal beam pattern is determined to maximize channel capacity and system throughput. Then, a power allocation (PA) agent dynamically distributes power to each beam based on traffic demand, optimizing resource utilization. During the training phase, a dynamic adjustment mechanism guides BH agents to balance throughput maximization and packet loss minimization by adjusting the penalty for dropped traffic requests. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in avoiding inter-beam interference, improving system throughput, reducing latency, and allocating resources based on demand.},

Most prior works achieve one-sided performance gain on either sensing or communication functionality by compromising the performance of the other. In this paper, the transceiver design and performance analysis are investigated to achieve mutual benefit between sensing and communication (S&C) functions in ISAC systems. We consider two types of user equipment (UE): the active UE (A-UE) actively communicates with the base station and the inactive UE (I-UE) stays silent. Both the A-UE and I-UE need to be sensed by the ISAC base station. To achieve the mutual performance gain, an ISAC transceiver is designed by exploiting the correlated S&C channel information within the received signals from multiple sources. Specifically, the sensing information extracted from communication channel state information and received echo signals is fused to enhance A-UE angle estimation and I-UE detection. In addition, the enhanced angle estimation is further utilized to improve communication beamforming accuracy. To quantify the mutual benefit gain, we first obtain the closed-form expression for the optimal I-UE detection probability and the A-UE estimation rate. Based on the angle estimation accuracy, the ergodic communication rate is derived and the asymptotic characteristic is further studied in the regime of a large transmit antenna number. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves simultaneous enhancement in both S&C performance, but also significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of ISAC performance metrics, such as sensing accuracy, detection probability, and communication rate.},

  abstract     = {The operation of autonomous vehicle platooning enhances road efficiency by allowing vehicles to drive in close formation, a process that depends on the platoon leader (PL) communicating essential information to the platoon followers (PFs). In such platoon operations, the efficiency of one-to-many communication and the capability to interact effectively with the PL's heterogeneous domain followers are particularly important for the PL. Tackling the heterogeneity between a sender and multiple receivers, numerous heterogeneous one-to-many signcryption schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes fail to address the issues of heterogeneity between receivers and low efficiency in concurrent one-to-many communication scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain-assisted multi-message and multi-receiver heterogeneous signcryption (BMMHSC) scheme, which aims to enhance the efficiency of the PL in concurrently transmitting multiple one-to-many communication messages. Additionally, this scheme leverages blockchain technology as a support system and uses smart contracts to manage the platoon, effectively tackling the heterogeneous communication issues in cross-domain vehicle platoon. A rigorous security proof demonstrates that the BMMHSC scheme is indistinguishable under chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA) and existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA). Experimental results indicate that the scheme incurs low costs in terms of computation, communication, and expenses, making it highly suitable for application in vehicle platooning environments.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection remains a high-priority research area for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD). To address the limitations of current mainstream convolutional neural networks in capturing global context and the elongated structure of lanes, we study a lane detection algorithm based on a dual attention mechanism using Transformer architecture (DATLD) for connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, a new infrared sensor for onboard use that is not affected by light is used for lane line image acquisition to detect lane lines throughout the day. Firstly, an enhanced dense connected Backbone network is developed to improve channel feature extraction capability. Secondly, a novel Transformer architecture (CSVIT) based on a dual attention mechanism is designed to conduct global modelling from the two orthogonal dimensions of space and channel. Improve the accuracy of lane detection under different weather, environment and time conditions. Finally, the accuracy of DATLD on the TuSimple data set was improved to 95.71%, and the FPS was 1030, satisfying the lane detection real-time requirement of at least 30 FPS. The F1 score on the CULane dataset increased to 66.12%. We have verified the validity and feasibility of DATLD in the Autonomous-rail Rapid Transit (ART)Center, thus ensuring driving safety.},

  abstract     = {Circulant transform multiplexing (CTM) uses circulant matrices for multiplexing and demultiplexing and different matrix designs result in different performance. In this paper, we analyze the design of CTM schemes for Doppler wireless channels and propose sparse-chirp-like-polyphase-sequence (SCLPS) and sparse-general-chirp-sequence (SGCS) based orthogonal CTM (OCTM) to improve the performance. It is proved for the first time that in the flat Doppler channel, the optimal CTM design that minimizes the bit error probability (BEP) should be OCTM based on a constant-amplitude-zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence. However, in the multipath Doppler channel, CAZAC-based OCTM can no longer guarantee the minimum BEP even when the cyclic prefix is long enough to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI). The proposed SCLPS-based and SGCS-based OCTM can manipulate the distribution of noise and ISI across subcarriers to achieve a flatter profile. Simulations show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, single carrier and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) in the multipath Doppler channel. They also have lower complexity and peak-to-average-power ratio, and their channel estimation method is compatible with OCDM. Therefore, the proposed schemes can be more competitive for Doppler wireless channels.},

The cumulant algorithm constructs virtual received data through delayed fourth-order cumulant calculations of the original received data, while the covariance algorithm involves delayed autocovariance and delayed cross-covariance calculations. Subsequently, spatial-spectrum based subspace method is applied to both cumulant-based and covariance-based 3-D NF localization, where the former requires a 3-D spectral search procedure and the latter involves a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional spatial spectrum estimator to obtain the 3-D parameters. Furthermore, the computational complexity, the maximum number of identifiable NF sources and performance analysis of two proposed algorithms are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms can achieve underdetermined 3-D parameter estimation for NF sources without any matching processes procedure.

Combining attention mechanisms and semantic understanding, the GTTI effectively handles largescale imputation, even in complex traffic scenarios with substantial data loss.

However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination system, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update process. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty and communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and comprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust cooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The trajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory distributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering probabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in practical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status update scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of vehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing that the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining comparable coordination efficiency to state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, our proposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless resources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.},

This paper investigates an FL realization in a CF-mMIMO system with multi-antenna access points and user equipments, employing multi-datastream transmission to leverage the advantages of multi-antenna transmission. The results of FL convergence analysis under two typical cooperative reception scenarios in the CF-mMIMO system—fully-centralized processing (FCP) and large-scale fading decoding (LSFD)—are presented without predefining the transmission and reception strategies. Based on the analysis, the optimization of FL convergence performance was carried out. Through decoupling, the FL convergence performance optimization problem is ultimately transformed into a series of weighted sum-MSE minimization problems. The alternative optimization approach is employed to design iterative optimization algorithms for both cooperative reception scenarios, thereby achieving optimal convergence performance. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the convergence analysis and demonstrate the advantages of multi-antenna multi-datastream transmission. Moreover, the proposed alternating iterative algorithms improve the convergence performance of FL under most experimental setups.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) enhances the performance of wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. This enhancement is highly dependent on the number of RIS elements, but practical challenges like high channel acquisition overhead and power consumption limit the scalability of traditional RIS systems. Recently proposed irregular RIS has been shown to tackle these challenges effectively. However, its potential advantages are not fully realized since the topology and precoding designs are alternatively optimized, which does not consider the impact of topology changes on precoding. In this paper, we leverage the benefits of irregular RIS and propose new approaches to exploit its potential fully. The key idea is to enhance the system capacity by enabling simultaneous optimization of the irregular RIS topology and precoding design. Specifically, we propose the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS topology, beamforming, and reflection coefficients. Unlike the conventional approach, PSO simultaneously evaluates potential solutions via particle updates that enhance the system capacity significantly. Next, we introduce an improved variant of PSO, designed to improve the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and speed up the convergence. Specifically, the improved PSO approach enables the dynamic adjustments of PSO parameters throughout the process, reducing the risk of premature convergence and significantly improving the overall performance compared to the standard PSO. The effectiveness of the proposed improved PSO is validated through a complex multi-modal Michalewicz function benchmark test, which illustrates that the obtained results are virtually the same as the expected results for different dimensional spaces. Besides, we also provide convergence and complexity analysis of the improved PSO. Numerical results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance the system capacity with low complexity by simultaneously optimizing the topology and precoding design.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicles commonly use Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar for environmental sensing and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for wireless communication. However, operating these systems independently leads to increased hardware complexity, cost, and inefficient spectrum usage. To address this, we propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources. In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR) and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)-which significantly reduce system complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging. Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.},

The results show that the algorithm is able to detect the sideslip angle on different road surfaces without knowledge of the current tire-road coefficient of friction.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, a promising component of sixth-generation (6G) communication networks, can enhance wireless network capabilities by modifying the phase and amplitude of reflective components. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted MEC strategy to provide a distributed edge intelligence (DEI) solution for systems providing fast wireless connectivity and low latency to ground vehicles in dynamic environments. The RIS-assisted vehicular networks model has recently showed promising results when the delay was minimized by jointly optimizing the computation offloading strategy and the RIS phase shift. The delay optimization problem was modeled as a markov decision process (MDP), and a delay minimization algorithm (DDPG-DM) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing non-RIS learning algorithms and classical methods, achieving superior performance in reducing delay.

This study aims to jointly optimize the deployment and beamforming of RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate of a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. We model the control of RIS as a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address this optimization task jointly. Specifically, we design the action space of the agent using an enhanced discrete Fourier transform codebook, which reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates the efficient training of the DRL. To exploit the graph topology inherent in the wireless communication optimization problem, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) structure to construct the DRL framework. Additionally, assuming the availability of location information, we utilize the location information of users and RIS to further enhance performance by designing an initialization network and modifying the state space. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint deployment and beamforming design, demonstrating up to twofold performance improvements compared to fixed RIS deployment strategies. Moreover, the proposed GNN-based DRL framework exhibits superior robustness, enabling flexible deployment across varying numbers of users.

  abstract     = {Ultra-dense LEO satellite networks (UDLSNs) have become a possible solution to achieve global coverage for highspeed data services. However, the high density of satellites results in severe inter-satellite interference, significantly affecting the network capacity. To tackle this problem, dividing numerous satellites into multiple clusters enables cooperative satellite management. For such highly dynamic networks, existing clustering methods deal with the problem separately for each snapshot, leading to the instability of the clusters and additional handover latency. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on multi-snapshot processing, i.e., spectral clustering with weighted bipartite graph matching and handover occasion decision algorithm (SCWB-HODA), to reduce the total network latency. In detail, the SCWB method realizes low complexity clustering while promising load balancing and interference avoidance. Due to the disorganized handovers of satellites between clusters, the method of judging whether to execute a handover based on a single snapshot will lead to frequent cluster variations. To enhance the cluster stability and suppress handover latency, the HODA method determines multiple candidate snapshots based on predictable satellite trajectories and selects the suitable snapshot for each satellite to achieve handover synchronization. Compared with baseline algorithms, the proposed SCWB-HODA can reduce the handover latency and improve the cluster stability by about 20%, which benefits from multi-snapshot processing},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) has emerged as a critical trend in the evolution of 6G networks. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient real time sensing and low communication overhead within complex Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments. This paper innovatively constructs a UAV-assisted three-layer federated learning framework for IoV, which addresses these challenges through the synergistic integration of the distributed characteristics of federated learning with the flexible deployment capabilities of UAVs, thereby enabling efficient collaborative optimization of ISCC resources. First, an enhanced extended Kalman filtering algorithm is designed to acquire real time vehicle state information, providing precise spatiotemporal state inputs for resource allocation. Then, a hybrid decision-making mechanism anchored in proximal policy optimization algorithm is developed to optimize system resource distribution dynamically. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed solution, demonstrating that compared with baseline approaches, the methodology achieves performance enhancements of approximately 40.19%, 41.07%, and 51.37% when handling complex tasks involving large-scale data processing.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of intelligent transportation and the exponential growth of data traffic drive the emerging of more computation-intensive latency-critical tasks in vehicles, bring challenges to the task offloading research in the Internet of vehicles, which provides vehicles with ultralow-latency task processing services via offloading tasks to Edge Servers (ESs) and Cloud Servers (CSs). Focusing on offloading splittable tasks, an end-edge-cloud cooperative splittable task offloading framework is presented for IoV, where vehicles with idle resources are regarded as temporary edge servers for complementing the computing services of CSs and ESs. Then, we propose a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to minimize task completion latency by making comprehensive decisions jointly involving task splitting, communication, and computation resource allocation. Furthermore, we propose a group-based random updating strategy for multi-agent deep reinforcement model training to promote training efficiency. To incentivize Highperformance Vehicles (HVs) to offer edge computing services via sharing their spare computation resources, we construct a Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg incentive game model where CSs act as leaders and HVs act as followers. We prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium point, and propose an optimal dynamic response algorithm to drive the CSs' resource renting price decisions and the HVs' resource sharing amount decisions to arrive at the SE point via multi-round negotiations. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over some selected benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Delay-Doppler multiplexing has recently stirred a great deal of attention in research community. While multiple studies have investigated pulse-shaping aspects of this technology, it is challenging to identify the relationships between different pulse-shaping techniques and their properties. Hence, in this paper, we classify these techniques into two types, namely, circular and linear pulse-shaping. This paves the way towards the development of a unified framework that brings deep insights into the properties, similarities, and distinctions of different pulse-shaping techniques. This framework reveals that the recently emerged waveform orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing (ODDM) is a linear pulse-shaping technique with an interesting staircase spectral behaviour. Using this framework, we derive a generalized input-output relationship that captures the influence of pulse-shaping on the effective channel. We also introduce a unified modem for delay-Doppler plane pulse-shaping that leads to the proposal of fast convolution based low-complexity structures. Based on our complexity analysis, the proposed modem structures are substantially simpler than the existing ones in the literature. Furthermore, we propose effective techniques that not only reduce the out-of-band (OOB) emissions of circularly pulse-shaped signals but also improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of both circular and linear pulse-shaping techniques. Finally, we extensively compare different pulse-shaping techniques using various performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio has license-free access to a substantial bandwidth of over 500 MHz, which makes it a promising candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), because the performance of both functionalities relies on the availability of sufficient bandwidth. However, due to its regulated power constraint and spectral mask, UWB sensing performance is susceptible to blockage, while the UWB data rate remains low. To enhance both functionalities, we propose a novel two-tier frequency-domain equalization (FDE) scheme for UWB ISAC, in which the first FDE removes the user-specific sequence from the received UWB header in support of sensing, while the second FDE equalizes the effect of channel impulse responses (CIRs) for data detection. The data-carrying amplitude/phase of UWB pulses, which are inherently repeated in the UWB header, naturally follow the circular convolution model without requiring a cyclic prefix (CP) for the proposed sensing operations. Furthermore, the CIRs estimated by the first FDE stage of bistatic sensing can be directly utilized by the second FDE stage of data detection. Compared to the conventional matched filtering (MF) aided UWB sensing, the proposed FDE approach improves the peak-to-sidelobe power ratio and facilitates multi-target sensing. Compared to conventional UWB MF template-based data detection, the proposed approach is capable of improving synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. Furthermore, the proposed two-tier FDE approach inspires a new pulse repetition tradeoff (PR-T) scheme, which reduces pulse repetition to achieve an improved data rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UWB FDE sensing achieves centimeter-level accuracy even at a low Ricean K-factor of -4 dB. Additionally, the proposed FDE data detection designed for PR-T is capable of improving the UWB data rate from the single Megabits-per-second (Mbps) range to over 100 Mbps, at the cost of reduced pulse repetition gain.},
