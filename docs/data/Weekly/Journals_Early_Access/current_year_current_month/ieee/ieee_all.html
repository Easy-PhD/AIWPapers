  abstract     = {Understanding the built environment is essential to the overall study of population dynamics, grid infrastructure, emergency response, among others. In the United States there are multiple classifications for buildings within the built environment such as residential, signifying family homes while commercial buildings consist of apartments or larger structures which are multi-purpose. While there is a high level of understanding of where these aforementioned structures are located, there is a third class of structures, mobile home parks (MHP) which have been under-represented in the literature despite there being an estimated 2.7 million of them within the United States. Research has shown that individuals who reside in MHP are at higher risk to extreme events due to their location and structural integrity of residence. Attention must now turn to identifying MHP at scale to help first responders and policy makers understand where these at risk populations reside. To address for this gap, we develop a novel methodology to infer MHP at scale based off morphologies derived at a building level. We show that across 3 million buildings in 6 states within the United States it is possible to identify MHP with 83% accuracy. This novel approach to identify MHP from other structures within the built environment using a machine learning approach provides a new tool to leverage in relation to helping at-risk populations.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating battery state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle applications (EVs) is crucial to ensure a safe and reliable vehicle operation. However, robust SOC estimation under all possible operating conditions is challenging due to varying load conditions, varying and non-linear battery impedance, sensor inaccuracies, among others. Meanwhile, battery management systems (BMS) are trending toward more compact designs to enhance reliability by reducing wiring and boosting energy density. Hence, minimizing the memory footprint of SOC estimation algorithms is a key challenge, as their design and tuning remain a time-consuming and costly process for the industry. This paper introduces an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) algorithm with a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. The first stage role is to find the equivalent circuit parameters’ optimal values in a non-SOC-dependent manner. The second GA optimizes the initial AEKF model tuning parameters. To mitigate the randomness of the GA, an algorithm is designed to automatically determine the optimum set of parameters with minimal user intervention. Finally, to avoid calibrating the AEKF to a Coulomb counter, the obtained parameters were tested locally and using an online tool to ensure the robustness of the estimator. The described algorithm achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7% to 2% across various positive and negative temperatures under several drive conditions. With this tool, the AEKF can be rapidly tuned with minimal user effort, providing fast and robust SOC estimation suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare. However, its adoption is hindered by the technical-proficiency gap, the disconnect between AI complexity and clinical interpretability. Although Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) techniques aim to address this gap, fragmented research limits the development of generalizable and practical guidance. In response, we introduce FIXAIH, a dynamic, evidence-based framework that consolidates fragmented research in XAI and IML into a coherent structure to guide implementation in healthcare. It is designed to enhance the transparency, accountability, and efficacy of AI systems -- characteristics essential to meet trust and legal requirements, e.g., in the EU AI Act. FIXAIH uses a machine learning-based methodology to holistically analyze literature to identify key parameters shaping the integration of XAI and IML in clinical contexts. We develop a BERT-based tool and examine 5,083 articles, identifying 13 key parameters across three macro-parameters: Research Methods, Health Disorders, and Disease Prevention. This categorization, refined through review of 200+ studies, clarifies applications, trends, and challenges in healthcare XAI. These parameters serve as design elements for developing and aligning AI systems. Drawing on them, FIXAIH supports diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and risk prediction through, e.g., feature relevance, bias detection, model refinement, data preparation, and expert-guided adjustments. FIXAIH embeds this methodology and adaptable guidelines at its core, evolving as new evidence becomes available, with the intention to expand through integration of social media, clinical insights, regulatory data, and other sources. This adaptive design supports continuous learning and practical implementation, promoting a trustworthy approach to medical innovation.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing accurate surfaces from sparse point clouds remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. In this paper, we propose a novel upsampling framework that focuses on surface-aware point generation. Our method comprises two key components. First, we introduce an adaptive query generation module that analyzes local attention information to determine where new points should be placed. These query points guide the generation toward regions of geometric significance. Second, we incorporate the Hyper Chamfer Distance (HCD) loss, which accounts for the distribution of point-wise distances to better capture complex surface structures. Unlike existing methods, our approach effectively combines attention-based guidance and loss-driven precision, leading to more accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments on PU-GAN and PU1K datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially in terms of the P2F metric. Moreover, the proposed framework maintains robust performance across arbitrary upsampling ratios and under random noise, confirming its reliability and generalizability.},

Evaluations on real-world grid datasets achieve 93.6% mAP@50 (21.1-point improvement over baseline YOLO11), 86% rare-component recognition, 100% text extraction accuracy, 99.4% connection accuracy, and 5.2s/image processing (3.04× faster than conventional approaches).

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance on user reviews for decision-making has elevated the role of online reviews on e-commerce platforms, yet the surge in generic, vague, or promotional content undermines their informativeness and credibility. While existing sentiment analysis and fake review detection methods classify reviews based on polarity or authenticity, they often overlook a critical dimension: how informative and actionable a review truly is. Reviews such as “Great place!” may indicate positive sentiment but lack specific, aspect-level insights needed by consumers or businesses. This deficiency creates a substantial gap in current review analysis systems, which struggle to differentiate between superficial and detailed feedback. Addressing this gap requires an approach capable of capturing both the presence and richness of aspect-specific content. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven approach for evaluating the informativeness of restaurant reviews by integrating linguistic analysis with Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. The KG is constructed using restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset to define aspect categories, extract aspect terms, and model their corresponding sentiment relations. The proposed approach systematically identifies and extracts aspect-sentiment pairs related to four critical aspects: food, service, price, and atmosphere, using dependency parsing and a curated lexicon. A custom metric, Aspect-Aware Length-Normalized Information Density (Aspect-Aware LNID), is introduced to quantify the richness and completeness of a review based on its semantic content and aspect coverage. Experimental evaluation on the SemEval 2014 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a 97.5% weighted-average F1-score in aspect category extraction and providing interpretable, scalable, and domain-specific insights. This hybrid approach offers a transparent alternative to opaque deep learning models, enabling fine-grained opinion mining and improved consumer trust in online review platforms.},

This study introduces a unified cybersecurity framework for cyber-physical power systems that integrate high-performance anomaly detection with provably secure cryptographic protection. A comprehensive dataset, built upon the IEEE 24-bus test system, includes a diverse set of operational states and five classes of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealthy and replay-based intrusions. To accurately detect both common and sophisticated threats, we implement a suite of supervised learning models—RF, MLP, and Decision Trees—alongside an ensemble strategy termed MVCC, which achieves up to 99.90% accuracy in binary classification and 99.88% in multiclass settings. For defense at the data level, we deploy a two-tier encryption architecture combining AES-GCM (for confidentiality and authenticity) with RSA-OAEP (for secure key management), demonstrating strong resilience against standard attack models (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA) and achieving nearly uniform ciphertext entropy (7.99 bits/byte). The system’s real-time applicability is validated through the deployment of the RF classifier on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform, attaining sub-second inference latency. Further, unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-Means) and temporal (LSTM) models are incorporated for stealthy anomaly localization and early threat prediction. This work presents a scalable, interpretable, and cryptographically secure solution for protecting next-generation smart grids against evolving data integrity threats.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has gained significant attention in past few years. The rarity of anomalies, considerable data volatility, absence of anomaly labels, and need for real-time inference in modern applications makes it a challenging problem. A robust training mechanism is desired that can accurately detect anomalous points in dataset with significantly large sized normal data. Moreover, multivariate data recorded by multiple sensors significantly varies from normal values in case of any defect. It is crucial to detect which specific sensor’s data are abnormal for system analysis and correction. To address these issues, we present a self-supervised transformer for anomaly detection, STAD, which enables robust learning from unlabeled data by synthesizing pseudo-anomalies during training. The research contributions are manifold. Firstly, a synthetic anomaly injection method is developed for anomaly generation and self-supervised training on critical anomalous behaviors. Secondly, a multi-head context attention module is designed and embedded with Transformer architecture to map the local and global associations, effectively distinguishing rare anomalies. Lastly, we propose attentive class activation tokens mapping mechanism that facilitates anomaly attribution by tracing the influence of individual sensor inputs through the Transformer model, offering transparent and interpretable insights. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving superior F1 scores and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.},

Slow-time codes alter the spectrum’s structure and result in increasing the blind areas within the blind-zone map (BZM). The hybrid framework comprises two layers that identify the optimum pulse repetition frequency (PRF) set and slow-time code by considering spectrum disturbances. The first layer employs the MSA for PRF set optimization. Modifications to the SA include restructured loops based on the perturbation functions. The outer loop considers the overall PRF set structure (overall direction and step—ODS), while the inner loop conducts a sequential search based on the cost function’s standard deviation and small increments. The output of this layer serves as the foundation in the subsequent layer, where the phase sequence of each PRF is optimized to concurrently minimize blind areas due to the M of N criterion and grating lobes through Mo-QEA. Innovations are mutation-like operators and tournament selection to enhance the diversity of generated solutions alongside rotation gates in quantum computing.

In this approach, a near user (NU) is selected dynamically based on its instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to serve as a DF relay for assisting a far user (FU), especially when the FU suffers from poor direct transmission conditions. To enhance energy utilization, the system incorporates a feedback-aided incremental relaying mechanism, which selectively engages relays only when necessary, thereby avoiding unnecessary retransmissions and reducing power consumption. We conduct a comprehensive statistical evaluation of key performance metrics such as bit error rate (BER), ergodic capacity (EC), system throughput, outage probability (OP), SE, and average energy savings over Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation outcomes validate that the proposed IR-RS scheme, when integrated with C-NOMA, consistently outperforms conventional IR-DF approaches across all evaluated parameters, showcasing its effectiveness for high-efficiency and energy-aware next-generation wireless networks.},

However, current approaches primarily rely on domain-shareable attributes, such as overlapping user bases or identical contexts, to facilitate knowledge transfer, limiting their generalizability without these elements. To overcome these limitations, we propose exploiting review texts, which are ubiquitous across most e-commerce platforms. Our model, termed SER, incorporates three distinct text analysis modules, guided by a single discriminator to achieve disentangled representation learning. We introduce a novel optimization strategy that not only improves domain disentanglement but also minimizes the transfer of adverse information from the source domain. Furthermore, we have expanded our model’s encoding network from a single to multiple domains, enhancing its efficacy for review-based recommendation systems. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we establish that our approach is more efficient, robust, and scalable than existing single and cross-domain recommendation methods.

  abstract     = {Crop residue plays a crucial role in diverse areas of soil, biomass, crop yield, and the environment by impacting aspects such as soil organic matter, erosion, nutrient leaching, soil moisture and temperature, plant emergence, in turn influencing plant biomass and crop yields. Measuring crop residue coverage has been a long-term practice, primarily for monitoring purposes by agencies for various programs. More recently, increased research effort has been focused on improving the means and mechanisms of measuring and sensing crop residue efficiently and on large scales for both monitoring and improved agricultural decision-making insights. This review attempts to provide an overview of crop residue measurement and sensing, presenting a holistic review of the different measurement techniques available. It also highlights how research has shifted from field-based measurement to the use of diverse sensing approaches and future directions. Traditional methods of crop residue measurement are reviewed and the literature on more modern sensing approaches is summarized through categorization of the approaches based on sensing scale of satellite-, UAV-, and ground-based systems. Key findings highlight the growing shift toward high-resolution UAV sensing and the increasing use of machine learning models for improved classification. Identified critical challenges, particularly in satellite sensing, include spectral similarity between residue and soil, influence of moisture, and limited real-time application. The review aims to provide a summary of the current state of crop residue sensing with insights into potential areas for opportunities, especially through on-machine sensing systems, emphasizing the need for real-time, integrated, and adaptive residue coverage sensing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Scientific workflows in cloud environments are highly complex and dynamic, necessitating intelligent and flexible scheduling solutions to handle important factors, including resource heterogeneity, budget constraints, deadlines, and ever-changing workload requirements. In contrast to traditional scheduling methods, a model with predictive ability and adaptability is required to manage these complex challenges effectively. Hence, this work intends to address the challenges associated with scheduling scientific workflows, balancing conflicting objectives, such as cost and deadline, managing intricate inter-task workflow dependencies, and dynamic resource availability. To accomplish this goal, this work presents a predictive state-aware deep reinforcement learning with a hyper-heuristic for deadline and budget-aware workflow scheduling optimization. Initially, the proposed system applies a Multihead Graph Attention Network (MGAN) to describe complex interactions between workflow tasks and cloud resources in order to predict the state for modeling an accurate environment. Moreover, the design of hyper-heuristic generation with Deep Q-Network (DQN) improves deadline and budget-aware decision-making in the uncertain workflow scheduling environment. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of deadline and cost-effectiveness, providing a reliable and intelligent strategy for scheduling scientific workflows.},

  abstract     = {Modern urban communication networks face challenges such as signal propagation blockages, which can be effectively mitigated using simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS). This paper explores the integration of multiple STAR-RISs into a symbiotic radio framework to enhance overall network performance, supporting both primary users and STAR-RISs that transmit their own data over the shared spectrum. The system enables RIS-feedback links within the same spectrum while accounting for direct links between the base station (BS) and user equipments (UEs). Two optimization problems are formulated based on different symbiotic resource-sharing policies and are equivalently transformed into weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problems, which are then solved using the block coordinate descent method. Furthermore, an iterative penalty dual decomposition is adopted to determine the optimal BS beamformer and the STAR-RIS transmitting and reflecting coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS optimization framework is demonstrated through in-depth evaluation results. The findings indicate that deploying multiple STAR-RISs significantly enhances overall communication performance. While direct BS-to-UE links enhance user performance, they negatively impact RIS feedback performance. Moreover, performance trends vary according to the selected symbiotic resource-sharing policy.},

The design method consists of the characterization of an isolated slot and then development of the linear and planar arrays. The proposed linear and planar arrays are 3D printed and metallized using a low-cost technique. A non-uniform 3D printed waveguide-based feeding is also designed to feed the planar array for achieving low-side lobes (< -20 dB) in the E-plane. Corrugations are added to reduce the side lobes of the planar array at the edges. The proposed antenna design is validated through experimental results suggesting an operating bandwidth of 15.8% between 26.45 GHz and 31 GHz for the linear array and 14.2% between 26.4 GHz and 30.4 GHz for the planar array with corrugations. The linear and planar arrays have high gain performance greater than 12.0 dBi and 19.0 dBi, respectively, over their operating bandwidths. The proposed arrays are suitable candidates for various applications operating in the millimeter-wave frequency bands, featuring cost-effectiveness, reduced weight, high gain, and excellent overall performance in terms of radiation.},

However, current techniques, such as multisensor data fusion (e.g. electroencephalogram, heart rate, eye movements, and other physiological signals), suffer from excessive dimensionality, intersubject variability, imbalanced feature vectors, and poor data alignment between sensors. This paper contributes three crucial points to addressing these difficulties and improving the performance in the classification of cognitive workload. First, it presents a novel theoretical model that explains the performance benefits of multimodal sensor fusion. Second, it introduces a feature augmentation strategy based on novel initial centroids optimizer techniques using k-means clustering that are intended to improve feature robustness in high-dimensional multisensor data. Third, it creates a hybrid learning pipeline that combines supervised and unsupervised methods, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble stacking, to improve cross-task generalisability and classification accuracy. When evaluated across eight multimodal sensor datasets (one public and seven self-made), at first, feature importance analysis corroborated the contribution of the augmented features. Secondly, the applied technique consistently improves the binary and multiclass workload classifications. Statistical tests proved the significance of performance gains. Thus, the results show that the proposed methods are useful in improving the measurement of cognitive workload from multisensor data.},

This paper presents a novel Local Linear Corotated Finite Element Method that addresses this challenge through a hybrid strategy combining direct and iterative solvers. Our method decomposes the simulation domain into element groups; the dynamics within each group are resolved using a pre-computed direct method, while inter-group interactions are handled by efficient iterative constraints. This domain decomposition enables significant pre-computation, replacing runtime equation solving with fast matrix-vector multiplications. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy, demonstrating higher fidelity than similarly fast methods. The method supports anisotropic materials and achieves low volume change (2.95% error) under nearly incompressible conditions. Furthermore, its group-based architecture exhibits high scalability on multi-core processors, reducing computation time to 19.6 ms for a 120,000-tetrahedron model using 64 threads. These characteristics make our method well-suited for demanding applications such as surgical simulation, haptic feedback systems, and real-time digital twins, where both accuracy and performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {The fastest growing and deadliest cancer, skin cancer, requires diagnostic solutions that are accurate, understandable, and therapeutically actionable. Our six-stage deep ensemble diagnostic framework, XAI-SkinCADx, employs hybrid feature extraction, deep learning ensembles, understandable AI, and clinical recommendation creation to meet this need. The 2367 dermoscopy images belonging to nine distinct classes of the ISIC skin cancer dataset are used to train the framework. Adding 5,023 new images makes the dataset richer and better balanced across the classes. A comprehensive performance evaluation is ensured by using the dataset with an 80:20 train-data/test-data split. It begins with hand-designed feature extraction using GLCM-based dimensionality reduction and visualization and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) visualization. Three convolutional neural networks are then employed to extract specific spatial features: DV-25 (DenseNet201 + VGG16), DE-25 (DenseNet201 + EfficientNetB5), and DM-25 (DenseNet201 + MobileNetV2). Temporal patterns are described with bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and finally classified with multiclass SVM. The accuracy is 95.63%, precision is 96.2%, recall is 95.7%, F1 score is 95.9%, and area under curve is 0.97. We interpret it using Grad-CAM++ and LIME. Compared to Grad-CAM++, LIME had better localization accuracy (IoU: 0.78, Dice: 0.87) while Grad-CAM++ had worse accuracy (IoU: 0.70, Dice: 0.81). The best performing classes with LIME interpretability, Vascular Lesion, Seborrhoeic Keratosis, and Dermatofibroma, respectively, with Dice scores of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 respectively. For providing patients with personalized suggestions independent of other information, a dermatology-focused LIME-based recommendation platform was designed. The timely dermatology consultation and decreased clinical burden are led by the classification by the system of the disorders as low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk. By integrating accuracy, clarity, and utility, XAI-SkinCADx creates a new benchmark for applying AI in the diagnosis of skin disease, enabling physicians to make well-informed and trusted decisions.},

However, the controllers employing four independent torque and brake, and active front steering actuators still need more investigation. In this paper, an integrated control structure is proposed to navigate the autonomous vehicle in trajectory tracking task at high speeds. A kinematic-based approach is introduced to estimate the longitudinal forces of each wheel. The steering angle is designed based on a robust sliding mode control, which is responsible for the convergence of the lateral errors to zero. The proof of stability for both longitudinal and lateral controllers in the integrated framework are provide based on the Lyapunov’s stability theorem. Finally, a co-simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim software to appraise the performance of the control system. The results show that the control method is able to perform the trajectory tracking in high-speed lane change. Additionally, the proposed control system performs better in terms of maximum amplitude of errors and root mean square of errors when compared to the results of other research. Furthermore, the proposed robust control framework shows promising results in the presence of external disturbance and parametric uncertainties.},

When it comes to evaluation, the accuracy of recommendations and ranked lists offers a narrow view of the performance, usability, customer satisfaction, and risks of an RS. Among several other desirable properties of an RS, fairness has rightfully gained a prominent place in the research community. Trade-offs have been documented between conflicting metrics, but no work has addressed these as a dynamic time-varying properties. By proposing a novel experimental framework that models accuracy and fairness as evolving, non-static properties of RS, we aim to provide a new way of examining RS properties and present fresh evidence on trade-offs. The significance of this topic lies in its implications for real-world deployment, where fairness across users and items, especially in multi-stakeholder contexts, changes over time and must be balanced with predictive accuracy. By re-framing fairness using stereotype-based control groups, we enable more nuanced and dynamic assessments. We apply this framework across multiple real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens+IMDb, Amazon), simulating user and item cold-start scenarios in a walk-forward evaluation setup. The results highlight the complex trade-offs between competing metrics and offer actionable insights for the design of fairer, more robust recommender systems.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a resistive gas sensor based on a sacrificial porous silicon layer was fabricated and investigated for its capability to detect various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at room temperature. The porous structure was formed via electrochemical anodization of low-resistivity p-type crystalline silicon and was subsequently detached from the substrate to form the sensor structure. Interdigitated aluminum electrodes were deposited on the surface of borosilicate glass to enable electrical measurements, and then the porous silicon layer was transferred onto the aluminum IDE. The sensor exhibited repeatable and reversible responses to a range of VOCs including acetone, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and n-heptane. Among these, acetone produced the highest response (Ig/Ia = 2.2), at the highest concentration (7700 ppm), correlating with its high polarity. Notably, the sensor exhibited an atypical increase in current upon VOC exposure at room temperature, which was attributed to surface-state passivation and dielectric modulation effects within the electrically isolated porous matrix. However, this effect reversed at temperatures above approximately 60°C, where the sensor displayed conventional p-type behavior marked by a decrease in current under reducing gas exposure. These findings demonstrate that structurally isolated porous silicon layers can serve as effective platforms for low-power VOC detection at room temperature, with their sensing behavior strongly influenced by surface interactions, temperature, and analyte properties.},

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, the ranges of head pose and gaze are believed to play significant roles in the final performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows that the model using only our synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data extended with a large label range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance on multiple target domains. The data are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/Gaze-NV-Rendering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, knowledge distillation-based approaches have demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. These methods typically compute pointwise feature discrepancies between teacher and student (T–S) to localize anomalies. However, this paradigm suffers from two issues that degrade performance: (1) some normal regions exhibit large feature differences between T-S networks (leading to false detections), while (2) certain anomalous regions produce small differences (causing missed detections). To address this, we propose a Dual-Teacher Guided Denoising (DTGD) distillation framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a noise-removal task, where anomalies are treated as noise. Specifically, the DTGD framework includes a normal teacher, an anomaly teacher, and a denoising encoder-decoder student. The normal teacher encodes pristine normal data, and the anomaly teacher captures potential anomaly features from synthetic anomalies, guiding the student network to retain normal features and expel noise. After each encoder block of the student, our teacher-guided noise removal (TNR) module injects knowledge from the anomaly teacher, explicitly teaching the student which features to preserve. Furthermore, consistency loss and dissimilarity loss functions enforce consistency with the normal teacher in both encoder/decoder outputs and increase dissimilarity of anomaly-related features from the anomaly teacher via pixel-wise supervision. Experiments on anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that DTGD achieves advanced localization accuracy and produces sharper anomaly maps, reducing both false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel approach, Channel Selection Dropout (CSD), designed to regularize deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Unlike standard Dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons in fully connected layers, CSD works on the image channels within the sequence of convolutional layers. Specifically, CSD is composed of three modules, i.e., Channel Process Module, Channel Drop Module, and Scale Module. CSD primarily emphasizes channels to identify significant channels based on activation values. It preserves channels that possess values above a user-defined threshold α. Channels that are less significant are set to a value of zero. CSD does not add any extra expenses during the CNN architecture training phase. It is used only during training and deployed only at a minimal computational cost. In the testing phase, the network retains its original state, resulting in no added expenses for inference. Moreover, CSD integration into current networks does not require re-pretraining on ImageNet. This makes it fit seamlessly with other datasets. Finally, the performance of CSD with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGGNet-16 is experimentally evaluated across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that setting α= 0.60 significantly enhances performance, with most results reaching over 95% accuracy on the benchmark datasets. However, the performance of α may vary, and it can be adjusted based on the specific dataset and architecture used. The comprehensive results clarify that CSD consistently enhances performance over the baselines. This method can be applied in future CNN applications to mitigate overfitting, particularly in image segmentation, Vision Transformers (ViT), and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.},

While numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) exist, significant gaps remain in addressing resource efficiency and the challenge of Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data in distributed vehicular environments. This study proposes Fed-CALiBER, a novel framework that synergistically combines a compact, pre-trained Lightweight BERT model with a Federated Learning (FL) architecture. By training collaboratively on distinct datasets assigned to Raspberry Pi edge clients, our approach preserves data privacy by keeping raw data localized and is explicitly designed to enhance generalization across Non-IID data distributions. With a reduced communication overhead by transmitting a small parameter footprint (approx. 13 MB) during federated updates, Fed-CALiBER minimizes network overhead during parameter aggregation. Our two-cycle experimental results demonstrate that the federated global model significantly outperforms standalone models in cross-dataset generalization—improving F1-scores on unseen datasets from as lowas 71.39% to over 96.59%—and successfully adapts to shifting data distributions. The framework is validated as a practical edge solution, achieving real-time inference (3–4 ms per sample) with low computational overhead on Raspberry Pi clients, representing a lightweight edge client.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a hybrid optimisation framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the construction of high-order Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. Such schemes underpin accurate and efficient time integration in computational science and engineering, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics to orbital mechanics and neural ODEs. Traditional optimisation of RK coefficients with interior-point solvers becomes increasingly infeasible as stage counts grow, due to the rapid increase in parameters and the highly nonconvex nature of the feasible region. Our approach addresses this by introducing dynamic algebraic heuristics that contract the search space through symbolic relations among coefficients. GA provides global exploration via mutation, while RL adaptively refines candidate heuristics based on reward signals, guiding optimisation towards stable regions while strictly enforcing order conditions. Empirical studies on third-order Extended-Stability Runge–Kutta (ESRK) schemes show reductions in Interior point optimiser (IPOPT) iteration counts of up to 36.7% for a-coefficients, with additional improvements of 32.5% and 24.5% for b- and c-coefficients. Statistical validation using t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of these improvements. Symbolic verification demonstrates that the discovered heuristics generalise across stage counts, maintaining full rank of the order-condition Jacobians and preserving third-order accuracy. Benchmark tests on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) systems, including the Brusselator, confirm both expected convergence and efficiency gains. These results establish GA–RL-guided optimisation as a scalable, robust methodology for designing advanced RK integrators, with potential to extend stability-optimised schemes to both classical simulations and modern machine learning contexts.},

This problem considers the assignment of CPU and bandwidth resources to servers and links, subject to network resource constraints. Given the dynamic nature of 5G core networks, where bandwidth and CPU processing demands fluctuate due to time-varying demand, user mobility, diverse QoS requirements, potential link failures, server outages, and the coexistence of multiple virtual networks (VNs), a dynamic resource assignment strategy is adopted in this work as opposed to static approaches in previous works. The majorization-minimization approach is used to handle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an approximation-based algorithm for core network resource assignment (ACNRA) with an affordable computational complexity is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing both network resource costs and server energy consumption. Statistical analysis of these results shows that our proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving average reductions of 5.92% and 10.28% in resource cost, and 5.43% and 10.10% in energy consumption.},

The key contributions are: (i) identification of 26 hazards across four operational areas (office, storage, transportation, and pressure testing), (ii) incorporation of activity-specific weights using PFAHP, and (iii) comparative evaluation of classical vs. fuzzy Fine-Kinney scores. The results demonstrate that fuzzy-based evaluations significantly change hazard rankings (e.g., office fire hazard moved from 8th to 2nd), while PFAHP weighting shifts the relative importance of operational domains. These findings highlight the advantages of combining uncertainty modeling and activity-based weighting to achieve more context-aware risk prioritization. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable framework for occupational health and safety risk evaluation in high-risk industries.},

  abstract     = {Adaptor signature schemes allow two parties to trade fairly. When a valid signature is revealed, the secret witness can also be extracted. This is useful in blockchain settings such as atomic swaps and fair exchange. However, if an adversary obtains both the pre-signature and the full signature, they can extract the witness. To fix this, we introduce a secret value aux into the extract algorithm. Only those who know aux can extract the witness. We also find that the adaptor algorithm must use aux to remain secure. In a fair exchange, the buyer extracts the witness, and the seller runs the adaptor algorithm. Since both parts need aux, both parties must share it. The auxiliary secret aux can be shared using various methods such as non-interactive key exchange (NIKE), interactive key exchange (IKE), and key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). We show that our scheme is aEUF-CMA secure, allows witness extraction only with the shared secret aux, and introduces a new property called witness hiding, which ensures the witness remains hidden without aux. Our contributions are: (1) We show that adaptor signatures can leak the witness if both the pre-signature and full signature are seen, (2) We fix this by adding a shared secret aux that only the right party knows, (3)We define and prove a new security idea called witness hiding, and (4)We give an example using Schnorr signatures and show how to share aux using simple methods like NIKE.},

  abstract     = {Sustaining digital platform adoption in computer science requires both robust system design and quantitative evaluation of user behavior and system performance. System Quality (SQ) encompassing reliability, responsiveness, security, and usability, is a critical determinant of adoption. However, most studies grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Task–Technology Fit (TTF) have overlooked objective SQ metrics and the moderating influence of Digital Skills (DS). This study introduces the Digital Educational Systems Adoption Framework (DESAF), which integrates TAM, TTF, and DS to analyze adoption of the Graduate Academic Information System Services (GAISS). A mixed-method design combined three years of Microsoft IIS server log data (2022–2024) with 550 user survey responses. SQ was quantified through request volumes, response times, error rates, and downtime, and analyzed alongside behavioral constructs using structural equation modeling in SmartPLS 4. Results indicate that SQ strongly predicts DS (β = 0.416, p < 0.001) and actual system use (β = 0.251, p < 0.001), while DS significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and actual use (β = 0.151, p < 0.001), confirming its dual role as both predictor and moderator. System performance improved substantially as average response times decreased from 526 ms to 305 ms and downtime from 3.67% to 2.86%, while annual requests rose from 155,000 to 966,000. Yet, feature expansion increased error rates to 14.88%, highlighting a trade-off between performance and complexity. The validated DESAF model advances computer science by bridging software performance engineering and behavioral modeling, offering an evidence-based framework for adaptive, user-centered platforms sustained through longitudinal performance monitoring.},

This study evaluates the spatial feasibility of four NBS types: green roofs, vertical greenery, and natural terrain with high or low vegetation across four pilot streets in Ljubljana, each representing a distinct urban typology. Using high-resolution environmental data and discomfort analysis (Ravnikar et al., in press), we developed spatial suitability criteria based on a targeted literature review and technical guidelines. These were operationalised in a GIS-based overlay analysis to identify feasible implementation sites. The results confirm that spatial constraints such as limited open space, unfavourable façade orientation, and underground infrastructure—often restrict the capacity of NBS to deliver meaningful improvements. While some interventions are feasible, their impact remains fragmentary, highlighting the need to consider spatial and technical requirements from the earliest planning stages. Proactive integration of NBS into spatial development is essential to move beyond isolated interventions and achieve systemic environmental benefits.},

  abstract     = {Image edges are essential for understanding and processing the content of the acquired scene, but a clear edge detection is not always possible. Unfavorable environmental conditions, poor lighting, incorrect camera settings and/or vibrations may produce blurry or dark images with unclear content and details. Local spatial filters are integrated into many hardware and software as sharpening tools, but choosing the most adequate filter and its parameters is usually non trivial. This work proposes a new filter, whose kernel is computed by comparing over a pre-defined window the image Prewitt gradient with an image contrast measure inspired by Retinex theory. The experiments, carried out on public real-world images with different edge visibility, show that the proposed image-aware filter efficaciously increases the edge visibility with low computational cost and performs better than a standard Laplacian filter. As an usage example, the sharpening filter is here applied to medical images of retinal fundus: improving the clarity and detail of these images is essential for visualizing and analysing anatomical structures, identifying abnormalities, and assisting in diagnosis and treatments. Finally, a hardware architecture of the sharpening filter, partially integrating on-chip the gradient and contrast computation, is outlined. Such an integration could be beneficial for enhancing in real-time the quality of pictures captured by devices with limited power resources, with an average consumption of ∼ 28 μW and ∼ 30 kb of embedded memory in case of a color VGA image. The data obtained in filter validation experiments show a marked increase in the Prewitt’s gradient magnitudes in 100% of cases and in the edge thickness in a percentage ranging from 73.3% to 100% of cases, without visibly affecting the image naturalness.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to unprecedented volumes of unlabeled sensor data due to its constantly evolving nature. This phenomenon has created an acute need for learning models capable of intelligently use such data devoid of expensive manual labeling. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has recently arisen as an efficient paradigm to meet this challenge by directly deriving informative representations from unlabeled data. Nevertheless, the practical application of SSL models is hindered by their over-dependence on hyperparameter tuning, which remains a central challenge. In addressing this challenge, we introduce an MA-ASA (Memory-Augmented Adaptive Simulated Annealing) framework for hyperparameter tuning that has been optimized to this specificity. This framework is built on the concepts of temperature-adaptive mechanisms, short-term memory buffers to mitigate repetitive evaluations, and stagnation-initiated restarts, offering greater efficiency in dealing with hyperparameter space complexities. The proposed method employs a two-step framework consisting of denoising convolutional autoencoder (dCae) SSL pretraining on unlabeled data and logistic regression downstream classification on sparse labeled data. The approach was tested on UCI HAR, MHEALTH, and Environmental Sensor Telemetry datasets achieving classification accuracies of 96.00%, 97.33%, and 99.25%, respectively. The results showcase that the MA-ASA-based optimization strategy improves the performance and generalization of SSL models relative to other IoT domains, all while retaining computational efficiency and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Data imbalance exists in appearance-based gaze estimation datasets, hurting the model’s generalizability and fairness. Unfortunately, this aspect is usually overlooked, and researchers focus mainly on developing more and more sophisticated gaze estimation neural networks. In this work, we identify two types of imbalance in gaze estimation data. The first is related to the uneven distribution of ground truth gaze vectors, and the second one comes from the uneven ethnicity distribution of dataset participants. We prove the negative impact of both of them on the model’s generalizability. Therefore, we propose Uniform Gaze Sampling and Uniform Ethnicity Sampling, simple yet effective re-sampling techniques tailored for gaze estimation. Moreover, we introduce balanced metrics, i.e., Balanced Gaze Error and Balanced Ethnicity Error, for a fair performance evaluation. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods and metrics on four benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address data imbalance in gaze estimation comprehensively.},

  abstract     = {Reliable signature authentication is essential across fields where identity verification is critical. Despite advances in machine learning, validating handwritten signatures remains challenging due to inherent variability in individual writing styles. Most current methods focus exclusively on verification, assuming signatures are already isolated and noise-free—an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework called SignForensics for robust signature authentication, directly extracting and refining signatures from real-world documents. Our system employs YOLOv10 for signature detection and extraction, and leverages CycleGAN to effectively remove residual visual noise, producing noise-free samples optimized for downstream analysis. To evaluate authenticity, we developed specialized SigNet and CapsNet neural networks, achieving strong generalization and accuracy. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 100% accuracy on the CEDAR dataset, 94.79% on the HINDI dataset, and 96.52% on the BENGALI dataset, remaining robust across writer-independent settings and previously unseen samples.},

In this paper, we propose a self-learning intrusion detection system (IDS) based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), a reinforcement learning approach capable of autonomously classifying network traffic without dependence on predefined signatures or labeled training data. Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, the model is evaluated under two experimental scenarios: a conventional random split and a more rigorous zero-day split, where ransomware families in the test set are entirely excluded from training. In binary classification, the proposed system achieves 97.6% accuracy (F1-score: 0.98) in the random split and 95.9% accuracy (F1-score: 0.96) in the zero-day setup, consistently prioritizing high recall for ransomware detection. In multiclass classification, it attains 97.0% and 92.0% accuracy in the random and zero-day splits, respectively. These results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning as a robust and adaptive foundation for real-time intrusion detection in evolving threat landscapes.},

The first is connectionist (or sub-symbolic) AI, which enables scalable and efficient statistical learning. The second is symbolic reasoning, which provides formal reasoning and explainability. This study conducted a systematic review of NS-AI architectures published between 2013 and 2024, synthesizing the structural patterns and integration strategies in 319 peer-reviewed publications. From this corpus, 18 representative approaches were selected based on their methodological rigor, symbolic fidelity, and conceptual novelty. These approaches were subsequently classified into three architectural paradigms: Sequential, Multi-Integration, and Hybrid. Based on this classification, a five-stage symbolic integration framework is proposed, comprising (i) data preprocessing, (ii) neural–symbolic embedding, (iii) incorporation of domain knowledge, (iv) logical reasoning modules, and (v) symbolic postprocessing. The findings indicate that multistage symbolic integration, particularly when embedded within neural layers and reasoning components, improves system explainability, robustness, and semantic alignment. Comparative analysis further reveals a fundamental trade-off: architectures grounded in formal logic exhibit higher precision and verifiability, whereas those employing representational-symbolic languages yield greater interpretability and flexibility. The resulting generic architecture provides a modular design blueprint for future NS-AI systems, supporting scalable, transparent, and semantically grounded AI development.},

The approach utilizes the dot-shaped cathode design to achieve hemispherical space-charge regions, effectively decoupling the photosensitive area from the junction capacitance and thus optimizing device performance for optical communication applications. Key device parameters—capacitance, bandwidth, light-sensitive area, and excess noise—are characterized and compared. All devices were fabricated on the same wafer for direct performance comparison. The presented dot-cathode photodiodes achieve significantly reduced total and normalized (per area) capacitance without compromising bandwidth compared to planar APDs. Among them, electric field line crowding (EFLC) based APDs demonstrate superior performance with the highest responsivity (0.4AW−1 @642 nm), lowest capacitance per area (1.58 aF μm−2), and low excess noise (F = 1.8 @ M = 10) with a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. In contrast, the presented N+/P-well (NPPW) based APDs exhibit high excess noise making them unsuitable for data receiver applications. Notably, the only PIN device presented, uniquely operates in PIN mode with maximum bandwidth, while all other devices show reduced bandwidth unless they are operated in APD mode.},

The development of functions that target the performance improvement of such systems requires understanding of the dynamics of the received signal. However, measurements of the signal received power (SRP) reported to date are limited to the blockage and micromobility phenomena in isolation. In this study, by utilizing individual measurements of blockage and micromobility processes, we propose a procedure for generating synthetic time series of the received signal strength simultaneously capturing blockage, micromobility, and beam-tracking procedures. Our results reveal that out of all the considered applications, only the most dynamic ones, racing game and VR, are characterized by significant differences between on-demand and regular beam tracking with 4-6.5 bits/Hz/s spectral efficiency degradation in the case of on-demand beam tracking as compared to the regular one. For applications with high-speed micromobility (VR watching and race gaming), the minimal beam tracking interval is 80 ms, whereas for low-speed applications, a period of 320 ms and even sometimes 1000 ms is sufficient. Our results show that the availability of information regarding the type of application allows one to decrease the overhead required for beam tracking by up to 20-30 times. The traces produced can be further utilized for various tasks, including the development of statistical tests for discriminating blockage and micromobility events, designing blockage detection algorithms, and improving beam tracking procedures. We made the data produced available to the research community.},

  abstract     = {The product delivery process is a set of steps to transport a product of an origin to a delivery point. Nowadays, there are different platforms or software based on classical algorithms for network optimization that help develop routes. Although these informatics systems provide vehicle routes, their prediction time has low accuracy compared to real times in the product distribution, since these systems do not consider the elements that affect route planning, i.e., despite providing vehicle routes, these software systems have low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to use artificial intelligence systems that consider the knowledge of the product delivery planning into route optimization models, thus increasing the time accuracy, but adding the challenge of having to interpret correctly the vehicle route ambiguities. Motivated by the latter, we propose a new fuzzy linear programming formulation to predict delivery times for products. Unlike previous studies, our methodology considers various parameters in the distribution process and offers an effective way to identify which parameters should be used. Our strategy combines the abstraction power of fuzzy logic and the result that provides a route optimization analysis, i.e., this work brings the best of the two worlds to address the difficult problem of shortest-route in product delivery. For that, our methodology has three steps. First, we introduce our formulation that incorporates a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) into linear programming to achieve accurate time predictions in product delivery. Second, we propose a fuzzy adjustment coefficient to consider the uncertain factors in product distribution and the expertise of the delivery staff. Finally, we develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize the distribution route and its time. On the other hand, we evaluate this methodology in the routes of a soft drink company using statistical analyses. Experimental results are feasible and promising. For example, in real-world scenarios, our approach reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 56% compared to methods that utilize artificial intelligence.},

By augmenting an Ellipta™ inhaler with inertial measurement units, this study evaluates patient inhalation motions using the acquired motion data. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed method is less affected by external factors such as ambient sound and temperature and can be applied outside clinical settings. The evaluation process uses a linear discriminant analysis algorithm to identify key characteristic variables associated with specific inhaler-use errors, and a judgment method using these variables is proposed. A dynamic programming matching algorithm is then applied to assess correctness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves high discriminant accuracy. By considering waveform similarity, it enables error visualization unlike contemporary methods.

  abstract     = {Private 5G (P5G) networks are driving large-scale industrial and enterprise internet of things (IoT) deployments. However, uncoordinated P5G deployments can lead to unintended signal leakage and inter-network interference between neighboring P5G systems. Constructing a radio environment map (REM) is a practical way to visualize and manage such interference. It typically relies on spatially regular measurements, but drive-test-based data are often sparse and spatially irregular. Furthermore, since signal strength inherently includes path loss, the spatial distribution becomes non-stationary and unsuitable for direct interpolation under sparse and spatially irregular sampling conditions. Removing the path loss component requires knowledge of the interference source location, but the source location is generally unknown in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement-based method to detect, localize, and map interference leakage. A novel localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the leakage source using only sparse and irregular measurements. The estimated source location enables decomposition of path loss and shadow fading, supporting accurate REM construction through spatial interpolation. Field measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling interference diagnosis and providing spatial evidence aligned with regulatory requirements for safe coexistence between neighboring P5G networks.},

The algorithm first applies spectral clustering to the PS from historical moments to automatically identify multiple subclasses of the PS. When environmental changes occur, the algorithm uses historical information to predict the centroids and shapes of each subclass, thereby constructing a new initial population. Experimental results on 14 standard dynamic test problems indicate that the proposed SCP-DMOEA outperforms four typical algorithms—PPS, MDP, KTM, and RNN—in handling various change characteristics in most test functions. These characteristics include translation or rotation changes of the PS, correlations between decision variables, and time-varying mixed Pareto optimal fronts (PFs), including variations in convexity and concavity. In particular, SCP-DMOEA also shows superior performance when handling optimization problems with more complex PF changes, such as the position of the PF continuously changes over time, the objective vector oscillates among several modes, and the PFs are discontinuous.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, most do not explicitly model boundaries as a separate learning objective. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS‑SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into a teacher-student consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries, providing complementary supervision from two independent tasks. To further enhance performance and encourage sharper boundaries, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, yielding more reliable boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hardware architecture for two-dimensional sensor calibration based on a segmented polynomial computation framework, which divides the input space into multiple regions and applies a locally optimized calibration function to each. To determine optimal segment boundaries, the system incorporates an Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM) that automatically analyzes sensor characteristics and selects boundary configurations that minimize global calibration error. At the algorithmic level, the proposed method integrates a Simplified Progressive Polynomial Calibration (SPPC) technique, which addresses the exponential growth in polynomial order observed in conventional Progressive Polynomial Calibration (PPC) methods as the number of calibration points increases. SPPC mitigates this complexity through a linear-order growth strategy while preserving high calibration accuracy within each segment. The system is implemented on a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with a dedicated Sensor Calibration Module (SCM) optimized for 8-bit signed fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed approach was validated through MATLAB simulations and RTL-level hardware implementation. Experimental results demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in execution time compared to conventional PPC and a 2.35% improvement in calibration accuracy through segmented calibration. Notably, the ASM-based segmentation achieved up to a 5.87% reduction in calibration error compared to non-segmented methods, even under varying input conditions, effectively reducing the need for manual tuning. These results confirm that the proposed architecture provides a high-performance, hardware-efficient, and adaptive solution for real-time calibration of sensors affected by nonlinearities and cross-sensitivity, making it well-suited for a wide range of embedded sensing applications.},

To efficiently operate the networks, an energy management system (EMS) is required, and it is imperative to validate applications in the EMS under a realistic environment using real-time simulators with a high-speed network analysis engine for power flow. However, classical NR-based methods are not suitable as analytical engines for real-time simulators due to their prolonged computation times resulting from complex numerical calculations. For application to real-time simulators that require high-speed computational capabilities, this paper presents a fast power flow method based on equivalent resistance for real-time simulators of MVDC distribution networks. In the proposed method, the injected power at each node is transformed into an equivalent resistance enabling a direct circuit analysis for a simple resistive circuit based on Kirchhoff’s law, which reduces computation time significantly compared with the classical NR-based method. Case studies on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which exhibits a high degree of accuracy and a high-speed computation capability when compared with the classical NR-based method.},

The study addresses key questions of resource availability, environmental impact, and economic viability through a threefold methodology applied to ten regions: (1) probabilistic wind modeling to accurately characterize high-altitude resources, (2) a comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify environmental impacts against conventional turbines, and (3) a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to determine financial viability. Our results indicate that the Gamma distribution generally provides the most accurate model for the high-altitude wind profiles studied (R2 > 0.997). The LCA reveals a compelling environmental case for AWE, with a global warming potential as low as 14.8 gCO2-eq/kWh in prime locations. The TEA projects a highly competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), ranging from $0.042/kWh in wind-rich areas like Çanakkale to over $0.16/kWh in less ideal sites.With an internal rate of return exceeding 18% in the most favorable regions, the study concludes that AWE systems appear to be a technically promising and economically viable option for Türkiye, capable of matching or even outperforming conventional wind power in select locations.},

In this study, we propose a novel method, HiTrans-SAM: Hierarchical Transformer Encoder and SAM-Augmented Inputs for Multi-Scale Remote Sensing Image Segmentation. The framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. First, prior to encoding, the input image is enhanced using SAM to incorporate boundary prior maps generated by SAM, thereby mitigating boundary ambiguity. Subsequently, a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder is integrated into the encoding network to facilitate information propagation. This module captures high-resolution spatial details while effectively leveraging global contextual relationships. During the decoding phase, multi-scale feature fusion is performed to ensure comprehensive utilization of features across varying scales, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy. Experiments on the LoveDA and Potsdam datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values of 53.52% (LoveDA), 79.45% (Potsdam) and 75.12%(Vaihingen), significantly outperforming existing methods.

We focus on two challenges: optimal spike encoding strategy adaptation for seismic data; and denoising performance preservation during CNN-SNN conversion. Through systematic experiments on the public Marmousi 2 dataset and field data from Sichuan Basin, we demonstrate that SNN can feasibly serve as an alternative to traditional CNN for seismic denoising tasks. The proposed framework demonstrates that count-rate encoding preserves critical seismic temporal features far more effectively than time-to-first-spike coding, owing to its inherent alignment with the network’s synchronous, rate-based representation. Our neuron optimization strategy combines soft reset mechanisms with adaptive thresholding, demonstrating enhanced performance that narrows the gap between native CNN and converted SNN implementations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a baseline alignment scheme ensuring fair comparison between the native CNN and its CNN-SNN converted architecture. This work demonstrates the first successful application of SNN to seismic signal denoising, offering a bio-inspired alternative to conventional CNN while preserving comparable signal-to-noise ratio performance.},

Research has shown that non-control-data attacks can be just as damaging as control-flow hijacking attacks and are even Turing complete, making them a serious security threat. However, despite being discovered long ago, the threat of non-control-data attacks has not been adequately addressed. In this review, we first classify non-control-data attacks into two categories based on their evolution: security-sensitive function attacks and data-oriented programming (DOP) attacks. Subsequently, based on the non-control-data attack model, we categorize existing defense methods into three main strategies: memory safety, data confidentiality, and data integrity protection. We then analyze recent defense techniques specifically designed for DOP attacks. Finally, we identify the key challenges hindering the widespread adoption of defenses against non-control-data attacks and explore future research directions in this field.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a straightforward, cost-effective, and flexible decision-making (DM) method for multi-objective FCS-MPC strategies. The proposed hierarchical structure DM method utilises the Euclidean norm to individually evaluate the main and additional control performances. Because it allows for the expansion of the number of hierarchical stages and does not require a sorting algorithm, it stands out as a flexible and technically effective solution among existing DM techniques for the given problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it is applied to the model predictive torque control (MPTC) strategy to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The MPTC with the proposed DM method is tested under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional MPTC. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed DM technique to handle ACOs in conjunction with the main control objectives and system constraints, while also demonstrating increased flexibility, enhanced control performance, and reduced computational demand.},

This study develops a robust self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation to address these challenges. We introduce a layer-wise low-rank adaptation (LW-LoRA) of the Depth-Anything-V2 foundation model, tailored for endoscopic data. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, LW-LoRA adjusts the LoRA rank across encoder layers for efficient training. The method integrates residual convolutional blocks (ResConv) to capture fine-grained details and a multi-head attention-based pose network to enhance camera pose estimation, ensuring accurate 3D reconstructions. A multi-scale SSIM-based reprojection loss refines depth predictions, while a brightness calibration module ensures robustness against illumination inconsistencies. During training, the backbone encoder is frozen, optimizing only the LoRA layers for efficiency. Extensive evaluations on the SCARED dataset highlight the superior performance of our framework, offering faster inference and high-quality depth maps. Zero-shot testing on Hamlyn and clinical datasets confirms its generalization across diverse data types. Our framework efficiently adapts the foundation model for depth estimation in the medical domain, addressing challenges in endoscopic imaging, such as brightness variations and fine-detail preservation.

The proposed geometry of the antenna comprises a circular patch surrounded by 18 quarter-wavelength bent stubs/corrugations and underneath coaxial feed that support the TM01 mode and produce a narrow-band linearly polarized (LP) CB radiation pattern. To increase the antenna bandwidth by improving impedance matching, six radial line slots were strategically placed in the top-patch, each oriented at 60° with respect to each other and rotated by 30° along the axis alignment. This configuration significantly improved the antenna’s bandwidth and maintains the beam at constant angle. Through optimization of the physical dimensions of the design, LP-CB antenna achieved a peak gain of 9.2 dBi with less than 1.5 dB variation across the bandwidth between 24.2 to 30 GHz. Moreover, gain patterns are circularly symmetric with very low-ripple at different elevation angles. By using the same top layer, and introducing three rings of tilted slots (6, 12 and 12 slots in each ring) in the ground plane, a second antenna is designed which is circularly polarized (CP) with a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 27.5 to 30.8 GHz. Across the operating band, the beam points at the elevation angle of 24° ± 1° for both the antennas. The simulated and measured results demonstrate that both the proposed antennas can achieve a -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW) of more than 22.2% for the LP design, 10.5% in the CP design, and both exhibit stable and consistent radiation patterns with efficiency values of better than 80%. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements was achieved. A simple planar geometry with wide bandwidth, high gain, and good CB radiation performance makes the designs promising candidates for 5G mmWave communications.},

Most detection approaches that rely on generator-specific artifacts or high-frequency fingerprints become susceptible to circumvention when these discriminative features are eliminated. As a means to expose such blind spots in state-of-the-art forensics, we introduce GenPure, a novel multi-stage purification framework that systematically removes both low- and high-level synthetic cues, enabling generated images to bypass diverse detectors under a strict black-box setting. In the GenPure detection evasion pipeline, a U-Net-based reconstruction module with multi-scale, spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels first attenuates synthetic artifacts while preserving perceptual fidelity. Next, a vision foundation model—intentionally unbiased toward authentic-synthetic classification—aligns the attenuated images with authentic image characteristics by minimizing distribution discrepancies in latent space. Finally, reference-guided statistical color recalibration restores natural tone and further masks residual forensic cues. The framework requires no detector knowledge or additional training and generalizes across generator types, resolutions, and content domains. Extensive experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art evasion performance across multiple unseen generative sources and detection systems without degrading visual quality. The results exposed persistent structural weaknesses in current forensic pipelines and underscore the need for semantically grounded, manipulation-invariant defenses.},

When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such “self-occluded” regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information.

  abstract     = {Fault detection, classification, and location estimation are paramount in transmission lines to ensure uninterrupted power supply, enhance reliability, and safety. Faster and more accurate fault localization is critical for prompt repair and efficient power restoration, thus minimizing economic losses. This paper presents a novel Fault Detection Isolation and Localization (FDIL) scheme, a machine learning (ML)-based framework, to increase the accuracy of fault location (FL) prediction. The proposed framework utilizes the phasor voltage, current, and frequency data obtained from optimally placed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for fault detection, isolation, and localization. This paper also proposes a hybrid deep learning-based approach using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks and an attention mechanism for FL prediction. Extensive simulations using the IEEE 9-bus system, with different types and locations of faults, are performed on the OPAL-RT simulator-based testbed to generate and train the ML models. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) metric. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in FL prediction, with an MAE of 0.0228 km, an MSE of 0.001, and an R2 of 0.9894. Compared to the best-performing technique reported in the literature (CNN-LSTM, MAE = 0.211km), the proposed approach achieves an 89.2% reduction in localization error. The proposed scheme and model outperform the contemporary model, as reported in various literature, making it an effective solution for real-time fault monitoring in transmission systems.},

  abstract     = {Software developers use Continuous Integration (CI) environments to reduce integration issues and expedite development cycles. Regression testing is an important part of CI practice, as it includes reconducting all test cases to guarantee system stability after upgrades. However, as test suites grow, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive and time-consuming. While many Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge, previous approaches often rely on static configurations and lack the adaptability needed to handle the dynamic nature of CI environments and different dataset complexities. To address these gaps, this study presents a novel TCP framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), integrating a pairwise ranking model with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, including A2C, DQN, PPO, and TRPO. The proposed framework improves prioritization accuracy and execution efficiency, particularly when combined with an optimal cycle count strategy. An adaptive training framework based on Meta-Deep Reinforcement Learning (meta-DRL) was introduced to further enhance the adaptability of the framework. This component allows the DRL agent to assess its performance during training and dynamically modify the essential hyperparameters, thereby enhancing its ability to develop successful prioritizing methods over time. Finally, the results of the proposed methodology demonstrate that Meta-Deep Reinforcement Learning (meta-DRL) significantly reduces the training time and achieves a 60% reduction compared to existing approaches. These findings show the efficiency of Meta-DRL-based TCP in providing a scalable and adaptive solution for enhancing regression testing in CI environments.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety and depression are prevalent psychological disorders that can occur throughout life, with a notably higher prevalence among women during the perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the postpartum phase. The early detection and monitoring of these conditions are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Although healthcare analytics has progressed considerably, the extraction of actionable insights from large-scale patient data remains computationally intensive, especially under instant processing constraints. Furthermore, conventional healthcare infrastructures frequently lack the scalability, computational efficiency, and architectural flexibility required to integrate machine learning models into clinical workflows effectively. To address these challenges, the proposed distributed computing framework employs Apache Kafka for instant data streaming, Apache Spark for efficient in-memory machine learning–based analytics, and Kubernetes for orchestrating scalable, fault-tolerant deployment. This architectural configuration facilitates continuous data ingestion, accelerates analytical processing, and ensures system resilience, thereby enabling the timely identification of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression during the perinatal period. Unlike schematic or batch-only prior work, we provide a production-ready, streaming-first clinical deployment and an empirical scaling analysis linking executors to end-to-end diagnostic latency and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in healthcare analytics.},

However, limited attention has been given to evaluating the visual quality of these enhanced images or leveraging perceptual quality assessment metrics as loss functions to generate visually compelling results. This paper introduces the Adverse Weather Affected Image (AWAI) dataset, consisting of 2,800 real-world weather-degraded images and their enhanced counterparts, annotated with subjective perceptual quality scores. We also propose a novel no-reference weather-aware image quality assessment (NRWIQA) algorithm designed for such images to enable quantitative evaluation of enhancement quality. Unlike existing methods that use generic features trained on natural images, our approach extracts deep features sensitive to weather-induced artifacts. A multiscale feature extraction strategy, fused via a cross-attention mechanism, is used to capture degradations across different scales. These features are further refined using a transformer to predict perceptual quality scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NRWIQA algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 17.61% improvement in SROCC, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing the quality of images affected by adverse weather conditions.},

Despite their effectiveness, these detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel gray-box adversarial attack specifically designed to evade DCT-based deepfake detectors. Our method accurately tunes the AC coefficient statistics of synthetic images to closely match those of real ones, while preserving high visual quality. The attack assumes full knowledge of the DCT feature extraction process, but not access to the internal parameters of the classifiers. We evaluate the proposed method against a set of DCT-based detectors using deepfakes generated from both Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). Experimental results show significant degradation in detection performance, exposing critical weaknesses in systems traditionally considered interpretable and robust. This work raises important concerns about the reliability of frequency domain detectors in forensic and cybersecurity applications.},

  abstract     = {The rise of digital banking has increased the frequency and sophistication of banking malware attacks, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving and adaptive detection frameworks. While Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative to centralized detection by enabling collaborative model training without raw data sharing, its performance declines in the presence of evolving, previously unseen malware behaviors, especially under non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid FL and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) framework enhanced with a feedback-driven continual learning loop for resilient malware detection. Our approach assigns three federated clients disjoint banking malware datasets comprising Zeus, Emotet, TrickBot, and benign samples under a non-IID setting, simulating real-world institutional threat exposure. Two additional datasets: one with malware variants and another synthetically generated to reflect evolved behavior are used exclusively for testing. Among multiple deep learning architectures evaluated, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is selected as the best-performing model and personalized at each client. ZSL operates during inference to reclassify low-confidence samples using semantic embeddings, and those with high cosine similarity are selectively reintegrated into FL training, supporting continual adaptation through feedback, without compromising data privacy. Experimental results show that the proposed FL-ZSL-feedback pipeline achieves an average improvement of 8.49% in correctly classifying samples with high confidence over baseline FL model across all clients and datasets. These findings validate the effectiveness of our framework in delivering privacy-aware, adaptive banking malware detection in dynamic, distributed environments.},

The digital twin enables the estimation of travel times based on the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the robotic fish, while the max-plus framework allows formal scheduling analysis of cyclic exploration tasks, ensuring mutual exclusion on shared resources and respecting mission constraints. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) further supports mission planning, enabling users to define points of interest and automatically compute overall mission times. The novelty of this approach lies in the integration of max-plus algebra techniques with simulation tools for underwater inspections.

However, raw PRO data collected in clinical settings presents two inherent challenges, including data sparsity (due to incomplete item responses) and imbalanced toxicity distributions. These factors complicate predictive modeling. This study investigates machine learning techniques to address these challenges by predicting outcomes such as pain and sleep disturbances using PRO datasets from a cancer therapy center. We implement advanced classifiers (i.e., RF, XGBoost, GB, SVM, MLP-Bagging, and LR) for multi-class imbalance tasks across three cancers. To address minority underrepresentation, we apply oversampling while preserving class ratios.

A central challenge lies in accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as ball bearings, especially when real-world labeled data is scarce. This study addresses this challenge by combining physics-informed simulation with a regression-based transfer learning approach. A 5-degree-of-freedom simulation model was developed to replicate the lifecycle of ball bearings under varying operating conditions, generating synthetic run-to-failure vibration data. The synthetic signals were segmented and processed using statistical and time-frequency features, with dimensionality reduction performed via statistical relevance and multicollinearity filtering. Tree-based regression models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained on the synthetic data and optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. To bridge the domain gap, the Black Box Adversarial Reprogramming (BAR) algorithm was applied to adapt these models for real-world data without retraining. Performance was evaluated across twelve structured transfer tasks using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Results showed that BAR-enhanced models consistently outperformed their unadapted counterparts, with the Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving an RMSE of 10.25 and R2 of 0.87 on the best transfer task. A statistical evaluation over 100 iterations confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, while highlighting its stochastic nature. Overall, the integration of physics-based data generation with BAR-based transfer learning offers a scalable and model-independent solution for accurate RUL prediction under data-constrained conditions.},

POA can be calculated using transposition models, that consider factors such as solar radiation components (direct and diffuse) and geometrical parameters like the tilt and azimuth angles. This study evaluates the performance of several widely used transposition models in the hot desert (BWh) climate of Doha, Qatar, using high-resolution (1-minute) irradiance data. A dataset spanning more than a year was analyzed with consideration of factors such as albedo, solar zenith angle, cloud cover, precipitation, and air quality. Several performance indicators including relative RMSE, relative MBE, and a risk index, were utilized. Among the tested models, Perez and Perez-Driesse provided the closest agreement with POA irradiance at two south-facing tilt angles, showing stable performance across seasons, while Hay-Davies emerged as least risky model. The analysis also revealed greater sensitivity to albedo at higher tilt angle. Model accuracy declined during cloudy and rainy periods, but improved during clear, dust-prone months. These findings highlight Qatar’s favorable atmospheric conditions for accurate POA modeling, supporting applications such as PV tilt optimization and system sizing, while underscoring the need for refined model tuning to address performance limitations under cloudy conditions.},

All modules used for DFAG are only active during training and are removed for inference, resulting in no additional computational cost.We validate DFAG on various multi-scale encoder-decoder-based image restoration models.

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are primarily capable of withstanding prolonged periods in unstructured marine environments. These are subject to several uncertainties, including the effects of underwater currents or drift, topography, water pressure, and other factors. The inherent motion of the vehicle is influenced by buoyancy or mass error and other slowly varying hydrodynamic coefficients. Moreover, an AUV faces various types of undetected faults during its mission execution. The use of large-dimensional, rigorous onboard sensor data from real-time AUV operations, subject to the limited power capacity and the presence of other acoustic issues, makes it more challenging for the control community from both stability and positioning accuracy perspectives. Hence, an anti-disturbance stabilized control mechanism is intended to perform a variety of underwater tasks in various uncertain oceanic environments. A two-stage high-degree cubature information filter (TSHDCIF) is designed to effectively observe unmatched external disturbances, uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, and actuator faultiness. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme incorporated with the TSHDCIF observer is proposed in this work. Various realistic scenario-based result sets, including 1) effects on ocean currents, 2) variations in hydrodynamic parameters, and 3) loss of actuator effectiveness, are addressed in this study. The control solution is compared with the baseline NMPC scheme to examine its efficacy, including depth accuracy, control aggression, convergence analysis, and computation time per iteration. Based on the analysis, the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme outperforms the traditional NMPC scheme by 5.49% in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) and 1.73% in terms of mean square deviation (MSD). The stability of the closed-loop system is explored using the Lyapunov theorem. Thus, it is recommended to use the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme for systems such as AUV for better efficacy, as mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a vision-based pose estimation of a target using a time-of-flight (ToF) camera. In particular, a relative pose estimation algorithm for non-cooperative targets that lack markers or accessible sensor is proposed. The proposed method, called the CSAC-ICP algorithm, combines a feature-based coarse registration method, known as Corner Random Sample Consensus (CSAC), with the well-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to ensure both accuracy and robustness. Here, 3D corner points are adopted as primary features. The corner points are obtained by first converting 3D point clouds into 2D images from which line features are extracted and then re-projected into 3D lines, enabling 3D corner points computation. This reduces the computation on a large number of 3D points, ensuring real-time performance. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is integrated with the proposed pose estimation algorithm in a loosely coupled manner, not only to continuously provide the target pose information for a moving target, but also to reduce measurement noises due to the motion. Because feature-based coarse registration takes advantage of the global optimization strategy, the proposed method can avoid the inherent pitfall of the standalone ICP method, in which the optimization process may fall into a local minimum and lead to incorrect pose calculation under certain conditions. Moreover, the proposed pose estimation scheme minimizes the dependency on the prior knowledge about the target object’s shape by taking advantage of the RANSAC-based registration. Numerical simulation is set up to validate the functionality of the algorithm using simulated 3D point clouds, confirming the accuracy performance under controlled target motion. In addition, the proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on an actual hardware platform, which demonstrates the feasibility of real-time relative pose estimation for non-cooperative targets within the space environment. Moreover, the proposed pose estimation scheme reduces reliance on prior knowledge of the target object’s geometry by using RANSAC-based registration. The simulation results show that the proposed CSAC-ICP algorithm achieves 30% faster computation and 50% higher accuracy compared to the standalone ICP method. Experimental validation further confirms that 3D corner features can be extracted at a rate of 30 frames per second. In addition, the pose estimation achieves an accuracy of up to 3 degrees for rotational motion and within 0.02 meters for translational motion along along all three axes, demonstrating the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios.},

Employing the non-parallel distributed compensation approach along with Finsler’s lemma, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize an upper bound on train performance and stabilize the system. The corresponding sufficient conditions are deduced in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed control strategy effectively integrates the benefits of CNF control with those of guaranteed-cost control methodologies. Numerical simulations comparing with different control methods are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink. The results of these comparisons demonstrate both the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Long-context question answering (QA) remains a significant challenge, particularly when using small-scale language models (SLLMs) with limited computational capacity. Despite their efficiency, SLLMs often struggle to capture complex reasoning patterns and synthesize information from lengthy documents due to constraints in context size and inference depth. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches offer partial relief but typically fall short when precise reasoning across multiple passages is required. In this study, we present a novel, lightweight framework designed to improve long-context QA performance in SLLMs by combining two key strategies: (1) instruction-tuned embedding-based retrieval for extracting semantically aligned context, and (2) a question rephrasing mechanism that decomposes complex queries into stepwise subquestions. This dual strategy enables structured reasoning without the need for additional training or model fine-tuning. Experiments on the LongBench and LongBench v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with gains of up to 5% over strong baselines. Our method is model-agnostic, effective across diverse input lengths and task difficulties, and compatible with a wide range of SLLMs, including LLaMA and GLM. The proposed approach offers a practical, generalizable solution for deploying robust QA systems in resource-constrained environments.},

Contextual anomaly detection is applied in several areas, such as industrial production process control, computer network security, and financial fraud detection. Probabilistic approaches to solving this problem are often neglected or insufficiently researched compared to numerous other anomaly detection techniques, and efficient algorithms for mixed-type tabular data are generally lacking. In this paper, we present a Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder for contextual anomaly detection, a new promising approach based on probabilistic modeling with a hierarchy of two levels: contextual and common. The trained model predicts the conditional likelihood of an event with respect to the observed context, which is used to distinguish between anomalies and regular data. We experimentally confirm the improvement of the results compared to a benchmark model that does not consider contextual information.},

  abstract     = {This study presents both theoretical and experimental investigations of the shape-dependent grasping performance of the "balloon pin-array gripper," which integrates a pin-array structure with flexible inflatable balloons. First, we develop a theoretical model that captures the nonlinear expansion behavior of the balloon membrane and formulates the mechanism of holding force generation when multiple balloons simultaneously contact an axisymmetric object. Each balloon is assumed to expand until it reaches a specified compression depth, with the difference between internal pressure and membrane tension modeled as the contact pressure, which generates normal and frictional forces. Subsequently, we introduce a parametric evaluation method using axisymmetric objects, such as cylinders, conical frustums, and spheres. By systematically varying geometrical parameters, such as the height, radius, and base angle, we experimentally measure the holding force and analyze its dependence on contact area, surface orientation, and pin-array discreteness. The experimental results show reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions with an overall coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.63. We also demonstrate that the gripper can establish contact and generate holding force even on challenging geometries, such as downward-facing surfaces. However, several simplifying assumptions in the model—such as the omission of balloon stress distribution and balloon-to-balloon interference—are presented and discussed as limitations. Future improvements are expected to involve pressure distribution measurements and finite-element analysis. These findings provide valuable insights into the grasping mechanisms of pneumatically actuated grippers and serve as a basis for optimizing design parameters and evaluating scaling limitations.},

  abstract     = {The overparameterization of pretrained transformers limits their efficiency in Environmental Sound Classification (ESC), incurring high memory and computational overhead. Pruning redundant parameters is a common remedy, yet fine-grained pruning at the intra-layer level remains difficult due to the large combinatorial search space and the risk of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Fine-Grained Pruning (AFP), an adaptive pruning method operating at intra-layer granularity under a user-defined performance constraint. AFP estimates the importance of prunable components by accumulating gradients during fine-tuning and then performs a binary search over the importance-ranked substructure space in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify the smallest submodel that satisfies the constraint. AFP avoids post-pruning gradient recalibration and efficiently identifies the smallest submodel via binary search, without traversing the full substructure space. Experiments show that AFP adaptively achieves up to 66.56% and 45.84% parameter reductions on the standard Audio Spectrogram Transformer for ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K, respectively, within a 2% drop in accuracy, outperforming popular baselines of static pruning or layer-level pruning in both pruning effectiveness and search efficiency.},

This paper presents the radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in a passive optical network (PON). The developed method aims to obtain different parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme as part of a 6G network. In this context, the RF signal is created with configurable universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), and the modulation scheme is modified to study the link’s behavior and to increase the system transmission speed. The first part of the analysis combines RF and optical systems in a co-simulation between MATLAB and OptSim. Meanwhile, the second part reports a real-world implementation of the front-haul link. The objective is to compare the simulation with the real-world results of the designed solution. For this purpose, we find the optimal configuration regarding the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM). In the real implementation, once the front-haul link is configured optimally, the RF signal is transmitted through a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This enables the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the analysis of a 6G sector in a controlled environment. We demonstrate that the implemented solution successfully achieves the required receiver in the PON and ensures minimal received power at the User Equipment (UE). The designed scheme provides an appropriate speed to transmit bursts of data with a very high transfer rate and ultra-low latency, which are essential features for new services in 6G.},

Therefore, more in-depth and practical studies on communication in control systems are needed. Our study aims to explore the practical impacts of communication networks on control systems. We provide a general overhead analysis for the structure of NCSs and design an express delivery-based cost chart, referred to as an E-Chart, for the control message sizes. We found an effect in the express delivery service known as the “Rice Grain Effect,” defined as the cost of delivering a single rice grain is the same as the cost of delivering two rice grains. We apply the effect to the control overhead analysis and the E-Chart. We present the results of the E-Chart and the overhead under different message sizes and compression ratios; furthermore, we define a new metric to reflect the stability of the formation control and conduct simulations to study the impacts of message size and error on NCSs. In particular, formation control is affected by both bit error rate and message size, and the system exhibits high sensitivity to variations in bit error rate.},

This creates an urgent need for storage systems that possess both high energy and power handling capacities to enhance the reliability and efficiency of microgrids. Hybridizing fuel cells (FCs) and battery storage system offers a promising solution by combining the advantages of both technologies. To this end, this article introduces an innovative model designed to determine the optimal sizing and management of a hybrid system comprising FCs and lithium batteries for islanded microgrid applications. The model considers the critical tradeoffs between the high-power density and efficiency of lithium batteries and the extended lifespan and energy density of FCs. Furthermore, it incorporates factors such as investment and operational expenses, the state-of-health of the FC, battery degradation costs, and the dynamic efficiency of the FC. To reduce computational burden, all constraints are modeled as linear, and mixed integer linear programming, suitable for linear models, is employed for the problem formulation. Simulation results and comparative analyses confirm the model’s effectiveness, demonstrating a reduction in annual microgrid cost by up to 24.45% while exhibiting a notable 8% reduction in required storage compared to using only individual lithium battery storage.},

  abstract = {Mobile service robotics is a promising technology for assisting hospital workflows, thereby relieving clinical staff from cumbersome tasks and battling today’s ongoing problem of severe personnel shortages. To that end, we present the world’s first robotic circulating nurse (RCN), a novel mobile robotic assistance system, which aims to support clinicians during surgical interventions by autonomously executing tasks within nonsterile areas of the operating room (OR) environment. A core use case of the RCN is the collection, opening, and handing over of sterilely packaged surgical materials, for which we describe our approach to robotic design and behavior implementation. Technical evaluation tests show that our RCN prototype reliably handles the end-to-end workflow for providing requested materials to the surgical team. The practical feasibility and user acceptance of the approach were confirmed during a user study conducted with the OR nursing team at a German university hospital. As a main focus of this article, the hygienic robotic handover of surgical materials was evaluated, yielding an overall success rate of 98.71%. While the execution speed is still in need of improvement, our RCN received highly favorable ratings with regard to relevance, usability, reliability, and hygiene. This underlines the high potential of the RCN concept for addressing the staff shortage problem and for upholding today’s high standard of surgical patient care.},

Additionally, we review publicly available datasets, identifying key gaps in their coverage of heterogeneous sensors, adverse conditions, and large-scale spatial scenarios. Finally, we propose actionable future research directions, including advanced algorithms for adverse environments, adaptive fusion strategies for heterogeneous sensors, and the integration of emerging technologies such as high-definition (HD) maps, large language models (LLMs), and end-to-end frameworks.

The aim of this paper is to develop an unconstrained parametrization of linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output (IO) discrete-time (DT) models that guarantees stability/dissipativity by construction, i.e., the model is stable/dissipative for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that any quadratically stable/dissipative DT-LPV-IO model can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball. The unit ball is reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in a fully unconstrained parameterization. These results immediately apply to linear time-varying IO models. In the linear time-invariant case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable/dissipative DT transfer functions is obtained. The unconstrained parametrization enables, among others, the use of neural network coefficient functions in LPV system identification while guaranteeing stability and dissipativity.},

The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.},

Sensitive information that could reveal the payoff functions is referred to as the privacy of agents. In the proposed approach, at least half of the agents (named as nonessential agents) can provide some nonsensitive information in addition to their state values, enabling the system manager to influence agents' dynamical decisions by imposing taxes or offering subsidies with a sustainable budget constraint. To protect the privacy of all agents, our approach shifts the stationary points of the nonessential agents and hence indirectly moves the Nash equilibrium of the entire system. By constructing the additional nonsensitive information from nonessential agents as the time-wise information of stationary-point mappings related to certain secret matrices, sufficient conditions are derived where the Nash equilibrium is shifted towards the target state achieving Pareto efficiency under the incentive mechanism. We also provide some stability conditions to ensure that agents' state converges to the target state under a sustainable budget for the given initial state. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficacy of our results.},

Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the distributed aggregative optimization challenge in uncertain multiple Euler- Lagrange (EL) systems, where each EL agent's local objective function depends on its own position and the aggregation of all EL agents' positions. The goal is to control all EL agents to reach their optimal positions as defined by the aggregative optimization problem. Two distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are proposed for uncertain EL systems, which are based on distinct optimization-control strategies, namely the open-loop optimization-control strategy and the closed-loop optimization-control strategy. To address the model uncertainty in EL systems, an auxiliary second-order system is introduced, integrating with adaptive compensation and tracking techniques to mitigate the uncertainty. Given the unique structure of the aggregative optimization problem, two distributed estimation protocols are developed for handling the aggregation terms in the optimization problem. Specifically, in the open-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient is derived from the position information of the auxiliary system; whereas, in the closed-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient relies on the real-time position of the EL system. The convergence of both algorithms is rigorously proved. Unlike existing studies that mainly concentrate on distributed optimization algorithms based on either open-loop or closed-loop strategies, this paper is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of open-loop and closed-loop optimization-control strategies, with a special emphasis on the robustness of the closed-loop strategy in counteracting external disturbances and variations. Finally, the proposed distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are applied to the optimal localization problem of networked marine vehicles with parameter uncertainties. Comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

Here, a heavy-tailed noise $\xi$ does not necessarily adhere to the bounded variance assumption, i.e., $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^{2}]\leq \nu ^{2}$ for some positive constant $\nu$. Instead, it satisfies a more general condition $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^\delta ]\leq \nu ^\delta$ for some $1&lt; \delta \leq 2$. The commonly-used bounded variance assumption is a special case of the considered noise assumption. While several distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed for scenarios involving heavy-tailed noise, these algorithms need a centralized server in the network which collects the information of all clients. Different from these algorithms, this paper considers a scenario where there is no centralized server and the agents can only exchange information with neighbors within a communication graph. A distributed method combining gradient clipping and distributed stochastic gradient projection is proposed. It is proven that when the gradient descent step-size and the gradient clipping step-size meet certain conditions, the state of each agent converges to an optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem with probability 1. The simulation results validate the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We investigate mental stress and relaxation patterns in professionals occupying leadership roles in emergency care and special police units. A key finding is that on days that involve critical missions, these individuals experience negative mental stress (i.e., distress) that escalates as the day unfolds. In contrast, on non-leadership workdays, mental distress remains relatively stable, while on non-workdays, participants exhibit positive mental stress (i.e., eustress) that subsides over time, facilitating relaxation. These findings stem from a four-day naturalistic study of $n=24$ professionals, during which we collected physiological, mobility, and psychometric data. Using participant debriefings and sensor-based validation triggers (e.g., GPS, cadence), we labeled activities in 5-minute intervals and focused our analysis on sedentary periods. We defined stress during these periods as a normalized heart rate that exceeds two standard deviations above a personalized baseline, thus isolating mental stress uncontaminated by physical exertion. A logistic regression model based on this stress labeling method yielded results largely consistent with those obtained from Kubios' SNS Index, reinforcing its validity. In cases of disagreement, our method aligned better with participant reports and established literature, highlighting advantages in interpretability and specificity. Overall, our work makes three contributions: (a) to affective science, by quantifying the mentally stressful nature of leadership in high-stakes environments; (b) to affective computing, by proposing a wearable compatible method for estimating mental stress during sedentary activity in the wild; (c) to data science, by introducing a well-annotated, multimodal dataset suitable for machine learning benchmarking in stress detection.},

This paper presents Ent-BAM, a BAM framework that incorporates entity (co-)occurrence information in a text-to-text generation paradigm. Plain text serves as the input, and the output is formatted in Augmented Natural Language (ANL). First, we employ a prompt-based strategy using a large language model (LLM) to extract (co-)occurred entities from the standard BAM dataset. Then, we construct the ANL output by embedding AC and AR labels, along with those extracted entities, within a single sequence. Ent-BAM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods by an average task margin of up to 4.86% Micro F1 Score, highlighting the strong potential of our approach.},

The existing defense mechanisms often rely on single-view, single-task models that utilize a single feature set to perform one specific task. However, modern IoT systems are multifaceted, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained, posing considerable challenges for developing unified and scalable defense solutions. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid model called M2VT that integrates Multi-View Learning (MVL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for effective cyber-attack defense. The model simultaneously processes three distinct subsets of relevant features (views) to perform three interrelated tasks: attack detection, attack category classification, and attack type classification. The model leverages AutoEncoder (AE) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract task-specific spatial and temporal features, enhancing both efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The M2VT model is evaluated using four publicly available IoT benchmark datasets and one testbed dataset. Across all tasks and datasets, the model achieves over 96% accuracy, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. The parallel execution of MVL and MTL, combined with taskspecific feature subsets, significantly boosts performance. The implementation of M2VT is publicly available in our code repository 1.},

  abstract = {Partially spoofed technology subtly manipulates interested parts in an audio to alter the original meaning, with its fine-grained forgery posing great challenges to existing fully spoofed detection countermeasures. Existing partially spoofed audio detection methods have shown excellent effectiveness in distinguishing clean and long-duration spoofed segments. However, their robustness remains limited when malicious attackers manipulate a finer-grained segment (e.g., only a single phoneme) and employ post-processing operations to reduce detectable discontinuities. To face these challenges, we propose the Semantic-Aware Inconsistency Learning (SAIL) method for robust frame-level detection. It incorporates a robust augmentation module (RAM), a Multi-Scale Semantic Inconsistency Learning (MSIL) module, and a Semantic Separation Module (SSM) to learn robust discriminative features by capturing multi-segment discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies introduced by partially spoofed manipulations. Specifically, the RAM is applied to suppress the model's erroneous attention to additional interference caused by post-processing operations on the subtle spoofed artifacts. Then, the MSIL module is proposed to extract semantic inconsistency features after manipulations, using attention mechanisms at different scales to highlight forgery differences at various granularities. Finally, the SSM is devised to refine these features for robust frame-level detection, utilizing contrastive learning to ensure a clear distinction of inconsistent semantic features in the feature space. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, including ASVS2019PS, HAD, and LAV-DF, showing that our proposed method achieves the best performance under various noisy scenarios.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-based generative models for speech enhancement often face challenges in balancing performance and inference efficiency. To address this, we propose a model of Variance-Preserving Velocity-guided Interpolant Diffusion (VPVID), a novel framework that achieves competitive enhancement performance while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our approach incorporates a scalable interpolant framework that reconstructs the reverse diffusion process using velocity terms and state variables. Unlike traditional score-matching objectives, we employ a velocity-based loss function that directly estimates the instantaneous rate of change, providing more stable training and efficient data distribution learning. We further combine stochastic diffusion sampling with probability flow ordinary differential equations, augmented by an adaptive corrector mechanism, creating a flexible sampling strategy that balances quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments on VoiceBank-DEMAND and WSJ0-CHiME3 datasets demonstrate that VPVID significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in noise separation with SI-SIR improvement up to 4.7 dB. Furthermore, VPVID achieves up to 7× faster inference than existing diffusion-based methods while maintaining excellent speech enhancement and dereverberation performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, emotion recognition has become an increasingly vital tool for enhancing customer service applications. Especially in telephonic interactions, detecting emotions accurately is crucial for improving human-computer interaction experiences. Despite significant advances in deep learning, current emotion recognition systems that integrate voice and text face challenges such as noise interference in transcripts and inadequate multimodal fusion, which hinder precise emotion detection. In this paper, we introduce MASKSER, a methodology that combines vocal signals and transcribed text in a robust manner. Our approach involves pretraining noisy transcripts with ChatGPT-4 using few-shot learning based on techniques such as masking and sentiment word replacement. This enhances emotion discernment significantly by leveraging the strengths of both modalities. To address the challenges posed by noisy data, we propose a mask-based noise generation model and use it to pretrain the transcript-based model, which helps mitigate inaccuracies. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function that evaluates the Kullback-Leibler divergence between text and voice encoder distributions, ensuring balanced contributions from both modalities. Experiments are conducted in both English and Korean to validate the language independence and robustness of the proposed approach in different linguistic contexts. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in emotion recognition capabilities, achieving high performance metrics while reducing reliance on costly speech recognition resources.},

This leads to parameter redundancy and high correlations across attention heads with only a minority of heads actively contributing to the task. In this study, we quantitatively analyze the parameter redundancy by comparing the linear centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity of learned representations extracted across attention layers and heads. Observing that widening the network can exacerbate these correlations, leading to representations with high CKA similarity, we question the design choice with uniform attention widths across all attention heads or layers and investigate how this choice impacts correlations across heads in the same layer. We design a width-adaptive training method to dynamically tune the model to keep the main contributing widths in each attention head and layer while no knowledge distillation or re-training process is needed. Experimental results on both English and Dutch corpora show our adaptive training method effectively reduces cross-head correlations and improves accuracy in automatic speech recognition.

  abstract = {Few-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical yet under explored scenario in dialogue systems. Existing data augmentation techniques either incorporate external data or generate hard negative samples within the feature space, which often leads to issues such as introducing knowledge bias, failing to align with the discrete nature of text, and inadequately addressing the problem of under-representation caused by in-distribution (IND) overfitting. Motivated by the recent findings that enhancing intra-class discrimination can mitigate IND overfitting, and the class of a sentence is predominantly determined by salient words, we propose EnSal, a method designed to strengthen the features of salient words in order to enhance the correlation between intent features and their corresponding classes. To achieve this, we jointly train k-nearest neighbors contrastive learning (KCL) alongside cross-entropy (CE) to improve the intra-class discrimination of intent features. Salient words are identified using both the k-nearest neighbors condition and the prediction probability condition. These words are retained as templates for synthesizing text samples, thereby avoiding the introduction of knowledge bias while preserving consistency with the discrete characteristics of text. Furthermore, we treat the synthetic text as noise samples associated with their corresponding training samples and perform denoising autoencoder (DAE) training on the augmented dataset. This process enables the identification of common and significant class features, effectively alleviating the under-representation issue. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art in few-shot OOD intent detection.

  abstract = {Superdirective beamformers are highly appealing for their superior directivity and effectiveness in suppressing diffuse noise. However, their sensitivity to sensor noise and array imperfections poses significant challenges in practice. Achieving higher robustness often necessitates a trade-off in directivity, thereby reducing their ability to suppress directional and diffuse noises. A key concern, therefore, is how to improve noise suppression while maintaining robustness. To address this, we propose in this paper a novel temporal-spatial joint high-gain beamforming method based on a Kronecker product decomposition, making use of the inter-frame correlation to improve performance. The signal model in the proposed work uses recent pairs of time frames and employs the Kronecker product of the steering vector with a frequency- and angle-dependent inter-frame correlation vector. The high-gain beamformers are formulated as Kronecker product filters, where the temporal filter is optimized to maximize the white noise gain (WNG) and the spatial filter is optimized to enhance the directivity factor (DF). With accurate estimation of the correlation vector, Kronecker product high-gain beamformers can simultaneously improve both WNG and DF. The proposed method offers flexibility and can be extended to design other types of beamformers, with a maximum WNG (MWNG) beamformer presented as an example within the same framework. This paper also explores three approaches to estimating the correlation vector: time-invariant, time-varying, and data-driven estimations. Simulation results show notable improvements in noise suppression performance across various scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Existing perceptual hashing schemes cannot solve the problem of the tiny proportion of text tampering detection, while simple text detection is unable to solve the problem of background region-aware matching. To address these issues, we extract text information via optical character recognition (OCR) and then generate the text features using the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT). Visual features of the image are extracted from the local and global features of the image using ResNet and Vision Transformer cascades, and then fused to generate the final hash sequence through the fully connected layer. The proposed network considers both image visual features and textual information to verify that the document image has not been tampered with. In our network, the OCR module enables accurate and intelligent text detection and recognition, particularly for dealing with text tampering that has only been conducted in tiny portions. It also provides more efficient and robust text recognition services. Experimental results show that the proposed hashing scheme is robust and discriminative in document images.},

However, recommendation systems often exchange item embeddings with third-party servers, which may expose sensitive information to malicious attackers. Specifically, attackers can infer sensitive user information based on published item embeddings and partial public user information. In this paper, we first design a model inversion attack to analyze the influence of conformity item embeddings and interest item embeddings on privacy. This analysis reveals that different item embeddings have varying resistances against inversion attack. Based on the resistance levels of the two item embeddings, we propose a novel adaptive differential privacy protection method that enhances resistance against model inversion attacks while ensuring recommendation accuracy.

In this work, we propose DucDiff, a novel dual-consistent diffusion model for enhancing target user representation used for information diffusion prediction. DucDiff harnesses the distribution generation capability of the diffusion model to generate target user representations from a distributional perspective rather than a fixed vector. Specifically, it captures the multi-latent aspects (i.e., uncertainties) of target user representation from historical and future user sequences, respectively, using disentangled dual denoising modules. Additionally, a shared information bottleneck is designed for the cross-distillation of knowledge between the historical and future denoising modules, eliminating the performance gap between training and inference, while ensuring that future information can be implicitly introduced during the inference phase. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate that DucDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

In this paper, we propose a variable dependency discrepancy-based Transformer (VDDFormer) for unsupervised MTS anomaly detection. VDDFormer comprises a variable correlation encoder, a temporal dependency encoder, and a reconstruction decoder. The variable correlation encoder capitalizes on a variable dependency attention mechanism, which employs self-attention to learn the global variable dependencies; meanwhile, the local variable dependencies are captured by the adaptive correlation matrix. The global and local variable dependencies are then used to compute the variable dependency discrepancy as a new intrinsic property to distinguish between normal and abnormal patterns. By integrating this new discrepancy with the reconstruction error, the model effectively enhances its anomaly differentiation capability. Extensive experiments on five real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that VDDFormer effectively and robustly detects group anomaly patterns by leveraging the variable dependency discrepancy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four out of the five datasets.},

  abstract = {The temporal knowledge graph (TKG) query facilitates the retrieval of potential answers by parsing questions that incorporate temporal constraints, regarded as a vital downstream task in the broader spectrum of the TKG applications. Currently, enhancing the accuracy of the queries and the user experience has become a focal point for researchers. Existing query methods of the TKG aim to execute unambiguous standard query statements to return query results while neglecting the potential ambiguity in user input queries. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a semantic query model for temporal knowledge graphs, TKGSQ-PM (Temporal Knowledge Graph Semantic Query based on Pre-trained Model). This model first identifies and extracts entity and temporal information from temporal knowledge graph queries and obtains corresponding temporal knowledge graph embedding information based on embedding methods. Then, it utilizes the pre-trained model DistilBERT to infer the true query intent from user input queries. Finally, it performs comprehensive sorting to return highquality query results. We conduct multiple experiments on three different datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results indicate that the TKGSQ-PM model has an overall advantage over baseline models in terms of query effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated text has introduced significant security concerns, driving the need for reliable detection systems. However, recent studies reveal that neural network-based detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. To improve the robustness of such classifiers, a number of adversarial attack strategies have been developed, particularly in the context of text sentiment classification. Most existing adversarial attack methods focus on the semantics of individual words or sentences, often neglecting the broader contextual semantics of the entire text-particularly in the case of long AI-generated text. This limitation frequently results in adversarial examples that lack fluency and coherence. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Sentence-based Adversarial attack on AI-Generated Text detectors (SAGT), which generates linguistically fluent adversarial examples by inserting model-generated sentences into the original text. To ensure contextual semantic consistency, we extract important keywords from the original text-selected based on changes in the detector's confidence score-and incorporate them into the generated sentences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that adversarial examples crafted by SAGT can effectively evade AI-generated text detectors.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.},

  abstract = {In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the accuracy of compensating for missing traffic data is critical. This directly impacts the effectiveness of traffic flow prediction and road condition monitoring. Inspired by image restoration techniques, this study introduces the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance traffic data compensation. Firstly, to address the problem of converting traffic data into the traffic flow matrix of the road network, we propose the RoadNetIMatrix algorithm to generate the traffic flow matrix of the road network. This algorithm precisely captures traffic flow dynamics in road networks and provides a holistic representation of traffic states. Secondly, given the inherent spatio-temporal correlation in traffic data, we proposed a spatio-temporal collaborative mining component (STSSM). This component integrates the hidden temporal dependencies and spatial features of the mined traffic data into the GAN generator to improve the authenticity of the generated content and ensure the consistency of data compensation. Finally, addressing the influence of external characteristics of traffic data on data compensation results, an external information module based on a multi-head attention mechanism is constructed, which can effectively mine the influence of external factors of traffic data. Furthermore, spatio-temporal and external features are fused to further improve the accuracy of data compensation. Experiments show that the model has a higher accuracy of data compensation and a better generalization of the system in the case of multiple types or a high data loss rate.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) involves answering questions based not only on the given image, but also on external knowledge. Existing methods for knowledge-based VQA can be classified into two main categories: those that rely on external knowledge bases, and those that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge engines. However, the former approach heavily relies on the quality of information retrieval, introducing additional information bias to the entire system. And the latter approach suffers from the extremely high computational cost and the loss of image information. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called TAG that reformulates knowledge-based VQA as a contrastive learning problem. We innovatively propose a triple asymmetric paradigm, which aligns a lightweight text encoder to the image space with an extremely low training cost (0.0152B trainable parameters), and enhance its understanding ability on semantic granularity. TAG is both computation-efficient and effective, and we evaluate it on the knowledge-based VQA datasets, A-OKVQA, OK-VQA and VCR. The results show that TAG (0.387B) achieves the state-of-the-art performance when compared to methods using less than 1B parameters. Besides, TAG still shows competitive performance when compared to methods with LLM.},

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Entity in One Word (MEOW) model. This model ensures alignment at various levels, including text-image match alignment, feature alignment and distribution alignment. Specificially, the entity image filtering module utilizes a visual-language model to exclude unrelated images by aligning their captions with corresponding text descriptions. A pre-trained CLIP-based encoder is utilized for encoding dense semantic relationships, while a graph attention network based structure encoder handles sparse semantic relationships, yielding a comprehensive semantic representation and enhancing convergence speed. Additionally, a diffusion model is integrated to enhance denoising capabilities. The proposed MEOW further includes a distribution alignment module equipped with dense alignment constraint, integrity alignment constraint, and fusion fidelity constraint to effectively align multi-modal representations. Experiments on two public multi-modal knowledge graph datasets show that MEOW significantly improves link prediction performance. The code of the proposed model is available at https://github.com/yuyuyuger/MEOW.},

This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering (SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges. This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5. The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text clustering.},

For big datasets, especially with incremental updates over time such as backups and gathered data, deduplication makes data management faster and more efficient. While many existing deduplication systems use default expected chunk lengths such as 4 KB or 8 KB, they are suboptimal. Poorly optimized deduplication systems can significantly increase storage costs and network usage, making large datasets prohibitively expensive to manage. We present the design, implementation, and an empirical validation of our Deduplication Change-Estimation Analytical Model (DCAM) which predicts the performance of sliding window-based deduplication parameters on any given dataset, to be used for parameter optimization. Our empirical evaluation includes workloads based on source code (Linux kernel, Kubernetes, TensorFlow), open-research datasets (CORD-19), and articles (Wikipedia). Validated using both our system and the Destor deduplication system, a DCAM-based search finds deduplication parameters that require up to 3.8× less storage relative to a common baseline. DCAM Search optimizes parameters up to 19.8× faster than previously possible, and the size of the resulting deduplicated datasets are all within 5.15% of the best results found by searching using actual deduplication.},

To address this, we propose scProGraph, a prototype-guided graph neural network that jointly models cell type classification and functional gene subgraph discovery. By constructing a cell similarity graph and incorporating cell-type prototypes as prior anchors, our method simultaneously optimizes classification boundaries and the interpretability of gene subgraphs. Experiments on seven independent datasets spanning three disease categories demonstrate that scProGraph achieves over 90% accuracy on four datasets and exceeds 80% on six datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals that the gene subgraphs extracted by scProGraph for Macrophage, Fibroblast, and Monocyte cover 26.92%, 26.83%, and 22.22% of a protein-protein interaction networks dataset, respectively, validating the biological relevance of the identified gene modules.

However, FL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious clients inject malicious data during training to compromise the global model. Existing FL defenses suffer from the assumptions of independent and identically distributed (IID) model updates, asymptotic optimal error rate bounds, and strong convexity in the optimization problem. Hence, we propose a novel framework called Federated Learning Optimal Transport (FLOT) that leverages the Wasserstein barycentric technique to obtain a global model from a set of locally trained non-IID models on client devices. In addition, we introduce a loss function-based rejection (LFR) mechanism to suppress malicious updates and a dynamic weighting scheme to optimize the Wasserstein barycentric aggregation function. We provide the theoretical proof of the Byzantine resilience and convergence of FLOT to highlight its efficacy. We evaluate FLOT on four benchmark datasets: GTSRB, KBTS, CIFAR10, and EMNIST. The experimental results underscore the practical significance of FLOT as an effective defense mechanism against data poisoning attacks in FL while maintaining high accuracy and scalability. Also, we observe that FLOT serves as a robust client selection technique under no attack, which demonstrates its effectiveness.},

CircRNAs can function as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby regulating gene expression and influencing disease outcomes. Identifying associations between circRNAs and miRNAs through computational methods enhances the understanding of complex disease mechanisms and offers a reliable tool for pre-selecting candidates for experimental validation. Existing models, however, are limited in their ability to capture either global or local node information, the prediction of circRNA and miRNA interactions is still challenging. In order to effectively deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework for predicting circRNA-miRNA interactions (CMIs), known as MuGNet-CMI, which leverages multi-head hybrid graph neural network and global high-order and local low-order information.

The multi-head dynamic attention mechanism, combined with GraphSAGE, is incorporated to efficiently capture both global high-order and local low-order node information. Additionally, we integrate neural aggregators into the multi-head dynamic attention mechanism to aggregate feature information from the captured nodes. Validation using three real datasets demonstrates that MuGNet-CMI delivers good performance in predicting CMIs, offering valuable insights to guide experimental research in gene regulation.},

In this paper, we present NetKG, an interpretable configuration synthesis tool.(i) NetKG leverages a knowledge graph as the intermediate representation for configurations, reformulating the configuration synthesis problem as a configuration knowledge completion task; (ii) NetKG regards network intents as query tasks that need to be satisfied in the current configuration space, achieving this through knowledge reasoning and completion; (iii) NetKG explains the synthesis process and the consistency between configuration and intent through the configuration knowledge involved in reasoning and completion. We show that NetKG can scale to realistic networks and automatically synthesize intent-compliant configurations for static routes, OSPF, and BGP. It can explain the consistency between configuration and intent at different granularities through a visual interface. Experimental results indicate that NetKG synthesizes configurations in 2 minutes for a network with up to 197 routers, which is 7.37x faster than the SMT-based synthesizer.},

  abstract     = {Traditional reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query schemes typically assume that users are available online in real-time for interactive key reception, overlooking scenarios where users might be offline. Moreover, existing privacy-preserving RkNN query schemes primarily focus on user features or spatial data, neglecting the significance of user reputation values. To address these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving resilient RkNN query scheme over encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data (PRRQ). Specifically, to mitigate the challenges posed by resilient online presence (i.e., non-real-time online) of users for interactive key reception, we incorporate a non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) protocol and the Diffie-Hellman two-party key exchange algorithm to propose a multi-party NIKE algorithm (2K-NIKE), facilitating non-interactive key reception for multiple users. Considering the privacy leakage issues, PRRQ encodes original multi-attribute data (i.e., spatial, feature, and reputation values) alongside query requests based on formalized criteria. Additionally, we integrate the proposed 2K-NIKE and the improved symmetric homomorphic encryption (iSHE) algorithms to encrypt them. Furthermore, catering to the requirements of ciphertext-based RkNN queries, we propose a private RkNN query eligibility-checking (PREC) algorithm and a private reputation-verifying (PRRV) algorithm, which validate the compliance of encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data with query requests. Security analysis demonstrates that PRRQ achieves simulation-based security under an honest-but-curious model. Experimental results show that PRRQ offers superior computational efficiency compared to comparative schemes.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires dependable operation in the presence of errors in the hardware (caused by for example radiation) as this has become a pressing concern. At the same time, the scale and complexity of LLMs limit the overhead that can be added to detect errors. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost error detection schemes. Concurrent Error Detection (CED) uses the properties of a system to detect errors, so it is an appealing approach. In this paper, we present a new methodology and scheme for error detection in LLMs: Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED). Its main principle is that the output of LLMs should be valid and generate coherent text; therefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from the normal text, it is likely that there is an error. Hence, errors can potentially be detected by checking the linguistic features of the text generated by LLMs. This has the following main advantages: 1) low overhead as the checks are simple and 2) general applicability, so regardless of the LLM implementation details because the text correctness is not related to the LLM algorithms or implementations. The proposed CLED has been evaluated on two LLMs: T5 and OPUS-MT. The results show that with a 1% overhead, CLED can detect more than 87% of the errors, making it suitable to improve LLM dependability at low cost.},

  abstract     = {In modern data centers and enterprise networks, software switches have become critical components for achieving flexible and efficient network management. Due to resource constraints in software switches, sketches have emerged as a promising approach for network traffic measurement. However, their accuracy is often impacted by hash collisions. Existing hash functions treat all collisions equally, failing to account for the differing impacts of collisions involving elephant flows versus mouse flows. We propose FSA-Hash, a novel flow-size-aware hashing scheme that separates elephant flows from each other and from mouse flows, minimizing the most detrimental collisions. FSA-Hash is designed based on two insights: separating elephant flows from mouse flows avoids overestimating mouse flows, while separating elephant flows from each other enables accurate heavy-hitter detection. We implement FSA-Hash using machine learning models trained on network traffic data (LFSA-Hash), and also design a lightweight online variant (OLFSA-Hash) that learns the hash model solely from sketch queries on the software switch, obviating traffic collection overheads. Evaluations across four sketches and two tasks demonstrate FSA-Hash’s superior accuracy over standard hash functions. Moreover, OLFSA-Hash closely matches LFSA-Hash’s performance, making it an attractive option for adaptively refining the hash model without monitoring traffic.},

  abstract     = {Shared L1-memory clusters of streamlined instruction processors (processing elements - PEs) are commonly used as building blocks in modern, massively parallel computing architectures (e.g. GP-GPUs). Scaling out these architectures by increasing the number of clusters incurs computational and power overhead, caused by the requirement to split and merge large data structures in chunks and move chunks across memory hierarchies via the high-latency global interconnect. Scaling up the cluster reduces buffering, copy, and synchronization overheads. However, the complexity of a fully connected cores-to-L1-memory crossbar grows quadratically with PE-count, posing a major physical implementation challenge. We present TeraPool, a physically implementable, >1000 floating-point-capable RISC-V PEs scaled-up cluster design, sharing a Multi-MegaByte >4000-banked L1 memory via a low latency hierarchical interconnect (1-7/9/11 cycles, depending on target frequency). Implemented in 12nm FinFET technology, TeraPool achieves near-gigahertz frequencies (910MHz) typical, 0.80V/25 °C. The energy-efficient hierarchical PE-to-L1-memory interconnect consumes only 9-13.5 pJ for memory bank accesses, just 0.74-1.1× the cost of a FP32 FMA. A high bandwidth main memory link is designed to manage data transfers in/out of the shared L1, sustaining transfers at the full bandwidth of an HBM2E main memory. At 910MHz, the cluster delivers up to 1.89 single precision TFLOP/s peak performance and up to 200GFLOP/s/W energy efficiency (at a high IPC/PE of 0.8 on average) in benchmark kernels, demonstrating the feasibility of scaling a shared-L1 cluster to a thousand PEs, four times the PE count of the largest clusters reported in literature.},

This paper introduces a novel batch-ordered job-store scheduling model, where jobs in a batch are scheduled sequentially, with their operations allocated in a round-robin fashion across two scenarios. We establish that this problem is NP-hard and analyze it in both online and offline settings. In the online case, we first examine the exclusive scenario, where operations within the same job must be scheduled on different machines, and show that a load greedy (LG) algorithm achieves a tight competitive ratio of $2 - \frac{1}{m}$, with m representing the number of machines. Next, we consider the circular scenario, which requires maintaining the circular order of operations across ordered machines. In this context, we analyze potential anomalies in load distribution during local optimality achieved by the ordered load greedy (OLG) algorithm and provide bounds on the occurrence of these anomalies and the maximum load in each local scheduling round. In the offline case, we abstract each OLG scheduling process as a generalized circular sequence alignment (CSA) problem and develop a dynamic programming-based matching (DPM) algorithm to solve it. To further enhance load balancing, we develop a dynamic programming-based optimization (DPO) algorithm to schedule multiple jobs simultaneously in both scenarios. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of DPM for the CSA problem, and we validate the load balancing effectiveness of both online and offline algorithms using real traffic datasets. These theoretical findings and algorithmic implementations lay a solid groundwork for future practical advancements.},

In this paper, we propose BaDFL, a novel Backdoor Attack defense mechanism for Decentralized Federated Learning. BaDFL enhances robustness by applying strategic model clipping at the local update level. To the best of our knowledge, BaDFL is the first decentralized federated learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees against model poisoning attacks. Specifically, BaDFL achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nT}})$, where n is the number of nodes and T is the global maximum iteration number. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis under two different attack scenarios, showing that BaDFL maintains robustness within a specific defense radius. Extensive experimental results show that, on average, BaDFL can effectively defend against model poisoning within 6 mitigation rounds, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds enables joint training of data located in different regions, alleviating the burden of transferring large volumes of training datasets, which greatly saves bandwidth. However, the limited capacity of WAN links slows down the inter-cloud communications, which significantly decelerates the synchronization of distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds. Besides, the multi-tenancy in clouds results in multiple training tasks running simultaneously, whose synchronizations consistently compete for the limited WAN bandwidth with each other, which further aggravates the training performance of each task. While existing works optimize synchronizations through techniques like gradient compression, multi-resource interleaving and so on, none of them targets at the synchronization congestion especially due to multi-tenant learning, which results in inferior training performance. To solve these problems, we propose a simple but effective scheme, SCC, for fast and efficient multi-tenant learning via synchronization congestion control. SCC monitors the cross-cloud network conditions and evaluates the synchronization congestion level based on the round-trip transmission time for each synchronization. Then SCC alleviates synchronization congestion via controlling the synchronization frequency according to the synchronization congestion level in a probabilistic way. Extensive experiments are conducted within our testbeds consisted of 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs to evaluate the performance of SCC, and comparison results show that SCC can reduce the average training completion time and makespan by up to 28.6% and 43.2% over SAP-SGD [1]. Targeted experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SCC.},

In UAV-assisted edge computing systems, multiple UAVs can cooperate with the cloud to provide superior computing capability for diverse innovative services. However, many service-related computational tasks may fail due to the unreliability of UAVs and wireless transmission channels. Diverse solutions were proposed, but most of them employ timedriven strategies which introduce unwanted decision waiting delays. To address this problem, this paper focuses on a taskdriven reliability-aware cooperative offloading problem in UAV-assisted edge-enhanced networks. The issue is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV trajectories, offloading decisions, and transmission power, aiming to maximize the long-term average task success rate. Considering the discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the problem, a dependenceaware latent-space representation algorithm is proposed to represent discrete-continuous hybrid actions. Furthermore, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning scheme by combining the representation algorithm and a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. We compared our proposed algorithm with four alternative solutions via simulations and a realistic Kubernetes testbed-based setup. The test results show how our scheme outperforms the other methods, ensuring significant improvements in terms of task success rate.},

To prevent this attack, VDS schemes must provide a revocation approach to revoke the old authentication information. The current approach employs the tree-like authentication structure or cryptographic accumulator, which will influence the efficiency of the VDS scheme. In this work, we find an approach to construct the low-storage VDS scheme supporting efficient revocation. Towards this end, we fully exploit the property of chameleon hash function with ephemeral trapdoor to propose a signature, which is the crucial step to construct the VDS scheme. In our VDS scheme, the size of the authentication information can be reduced to be less than the scale of the data streaming (i.e., low storage). Furthermore, the client is able to revoke the old authentication information in an efficient manner, where she only needs to release a message (i.e., efficient revocation). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VDS scheme is efficient and practical.},

  abstract     = {The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1× inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.},

Adversaries can exploit this by flooding the blockchain network with spam transactions, aiming to deplete device energy and disrupt system performance. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a reputation-based energy-efficient transaction propagation mechanism that alleviates spam transaction attacks while reducing computing resources and energy consumption. Firstly, we design a subjective logic-based reputation scheme that assesses node trust by integrating local and recommended opinions and incorporates opinion acceptance to counteract false evidence. Then, we optimize the transaction verification method by adjusting transaction discard and verification probabilities based on the proposed reputation scheme to curb the propagation of spam transactions and reduce verification consumption. Finally, we enhance the transaction transmission strategy by prioritizing nodes with higher reputations, enhancing both resilience to spam transactions and transmission reliability. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

However, existing works focus on the privacy-preserving schemes with traditional tree indexes, causing more computing and storage issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient conjunctive geometric range query scheme over encrypted spatial data with a learned index. In particular, we design a new privacy-preserving learned index for spatial data to reduce the search space and storage overhead. The main idea is to add noise disturbance to the objective function instead of directly adding it to output results, reducing the leakage of private information and ensuring the correctness of output results. Moreover, we propose a spatial segmentation algorithm to avoid accessing a large number of unnecessary Z codes in the query process. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme ensures index data security and query privacy. Simulation results show that the query efficiency is improved while the storage overhead is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and fast data stream mining is critical to many tasks, including real-time series analysis for mobile sensor data, big data management and machine learning. Various heavy-oriented item detection tasks, such as identifying heavy hitters, heavy changers, persistent items, and significant items, have garnered considerable attention from both industry and academia. Unfortunately, as data stream speeds continue to increase and the available memory, particularly in L1 cache, remains limited for real-time processing, existing schemes face challenges in simultaneously achieving high detection accuracy, memory efficiency, and fast update throughput, as we reveal. To tackle this conundrum, we propose a versatile and elegant sketch framework named Tight-Sketch, which supports a spectrum of heavy-based detection tasks. Recognizing that, in practice, most items are cold (non-heavy/persistent/significant), we implement distinct eviction strategies for different item types. This approach allows us to swiftly discard potentially cold items while offering enhanced protection to hot ones (heavy/persistent/significant). Additionally, we introduce an eviction method based on stochastic decay, ensuring that Tight-Sketch incurs only small one-sided errors without overestimation. To further enhance detection accuracy under extremely constrained memory allocations, we introduce Tight-Opt, a variant incorporating two optimization strategies. We conduct extensive experiments across various detection tasks to demonstrate that Tight-Sketch significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and update speed. Furthermore, by utilizing Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, we enhance Tight-Sketch’s update throughput by up to 36%. We also implement Tight-Sketch on FPGA to validate its practicality and low resource overhead in hardware deployments.},

  abstract     = {As multiprocessor systems scale up, h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability serve as two pivotal metrics for assessing the reliability of the underlying interconnection networks. To ensure that each component of the survival graph holds no fewer than h + 1 vertices, the h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability have been proposed to characterize the fault tolerability and self-diagnosing capability of networks, respectively. Many efforts have been made to establish the quantifiable relationship between these metrics but it is less than optimal. This work addresses the flaws of the existing results and proposes a novel proof to determine the metric relationship between h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability under the PMC and MM* models. Our approach overcomes the defect of previous results by abandoning the network’s regularity and independence number. Furthermore, we apply the suggested metric to establish the h-extra diagnosability of a new network class, named generalized exchanged X-cube-like network GEXC(s, t), which takes dual-cube-like network, generalized exchanged hypercube, generalized exchanged crossed cube, and locally generalized exchanged twisted cube as special cases. Finally, we propose the h-extra diagnosis strategy (h-EDS) and design two self-diagnosis algorithms AhED-PMC and AhED-MM*, and then conduct experiments on GEXC(s, t) and the real-world network DD-g648 to show the high accuracy and superior performance of the proposed algorithms.},

In real-time scheduling, a fundamental problem is how to upper-bound the response times of a task. Recent work applied the multi-path technique to reduce the response time bound for tasks with parallel execution, but left tasks with conditional execution as an open problem. This paper focuses on upper-bounding response times for tasks with both parallel execution and conditional execution using the multi-path technique. By designing a delicate abstraction regarding the multiple paths of various conditional branches, we derive a new response time bound. We further apply this response time bound into the scheduling of multiple parallel tasks with conditional branches. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed bound significantly advances the state-of-the-art, reducing the response time bound by 9.4% and improving the schedulability by 31.2% on average.},

In addition, multiple-precision multipliers are in high demand for efficient NN accelerators; therefore, recursive multipliers used in low-precision fusion schemes are gaining increasing attention. In this work, we design exact recursive multipliers based on customized approximate full adders (AFAs) for low-power purposes. Initially, the partial products (PPs) encoded by 2×2 multiplications are analyzed, which reveals the correlations among adjacent PPs. Based on these correlations, we propose 4×4 recursive multiplier architectures where certain full adders (FAs) can be simplified without affecting the correctness of the multiplication. Manually and synthesis tool-based FA simplifications are performed separately. The obtained 4×4 multipliers are then used to construct 8×8 multipliers based on a low-power recursive architecture. Finally, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 and 8×8 multipliers are evaluated using a 28nm CMOS technology. Compared with DesignWare (DW) multipliers, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 multipliers achieve power reductions of 16.5% and 11.6%, respectively, without compromising area or delay; alternatively, the delay can be reduced by 20.9% and 39.4%, respectively, without compromising power or area. For signed and unsigned 8×8 multipliers, the maximum power reductions are 9.7% and 13.7%, respectively, albeit with a trade-off in area.},

However, current CPU-optimized key-value stores adopt suboptimal intra- and inter-thread models, hence incurring memory-level stalling and load imbalance that hinder cores from realizing their full potential. We present STAGEWISE, an CPU-efficient key-value store on fast NVMe SSDs with high throughput. To achieve this, we introduce a new thread model for StageWise to process KV requests. Specifically, STAGEWISE converts the processing of each KV request into multiple asynchronous stages, and thus enables pipelining across all stages. STAGEWISE further introduces a client-driven share-index architecture to ease inter-thread load imbalance and maximize the pipelining opportunity. Guided by Little’s Law, STAGEWISE improves concurrency, and therefore efficiently uses CPU to reach higher throughput. Extensive experimental results show that STAGEWISE outperforms CPUoptimized key-value stores (e.g., KVell) by up to 3.5× with writeintensive workloads, and storage-optimized ones (e.g., RocksDB) by over an order of magnitude. STAGEWISE also shows higher read performance and excellent scalability under various workloads.},

  abstract     = {Sorting operations are considered to be a significant part of any computer system and are widely used in many applications. In applications where sorting has to be efficiently accomplished (i.e., in O(1) time) on small-sized entries, hardware accelerators, such as ASICs, FPGAs, or GPUs, are used to speed up the sorting operations. In the literature, the bitonic sort algorithm (or variants thereof) is still considered to be the most commonly used approach in many hardware sort implementations for decades. However, the time complexity of the bitonic sort is O((log(n))2) for sorting n elements, which does not satisfy the constant-time constraint we demand for our setting. In this paper, we propose competition-style sorting networks (CSNs), a framework for designing hardware-based competition-style class of sorting networks that captures all forms of two-stage sorting networks where the first stage (competition) consists of pairwise comparisons and the second stage (evaluation) ranks the entries and sorts them. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we develop and test one instance of this design, called the Competition Sort Algorithm (CSA), which has a time complexity of O(1), and specifically, one clock cycle. We implemented and tested CSA on both an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and the NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU then measured its gain, which combines the trade-offs between the relative speedup and the relative area increase, against the bitonic sort. Our results show that the CSA achieves a significant gain of up to 11.01× on the FPGA and a relative speedup of up to 3.32× on the GPU. We also compare the area, power, and latency of CSA with the bitonic sort algorithm on the FPGA.},

Many concurrent inference requests and intricate DNN models demand efficient multi-DNN inference in MEC networks. However, the resource-limited IoT device/edge server and expanding model size force models to be dynamically deployed, resulting in significant undesired energy consumption. In addition, parallel multi-DNN inference on the same device complicates the inference process due to the resource competition among models, increasing the inference latency. In this paper, we propose a Resource-aware and Dynamic DNN Deployment (R3D) scheme with the collaboration of end-edge-cloud. To mitigate resource competition and waste during multi-DNN parallel inference, we develop a Resource Adaptive Management (RAM) algorithm based on the Roofline model, which dynamically allocates resources by accounting for the impact of device-specific performance bottlenecks on inference latency. Additionally, we design a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based online optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts DNN deployment strategies to achieve fast and energy-efficient inference across heterogeneous devices. Experiment results demonstrate that R3D is applicable in MEC environments and performs well in terms of inference latency, resource utilization, and energy consumption.},

Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g. 28nm CPU, whereas a product instance can be made in various regions and time periods. Carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a product instance can differ from its product class. Additionally, different carbon attribution methods (e.g., location-based and market-based) can affect the carbon emissions of electricity, thus further affecting the embodied carbon of products. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) accounting models with dual attribution methods. We observe significant differences between STEC and current models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference is 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) training and LLM inference. We observe that using STEC results in much greater differences in the embodied carbon of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%).},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by training models on edge client devices using their local data without revealing their raw data. In edge environments, various applications require different neural network models, making it crucial to perform joint training of multiple models on edge devices, known as multi-task FL. While existing multi-task FL approaches enhance resource utilization on edge devices through adaptive resource configuration or client selection, optimizing either of these aspects alone may lead to suboptimality. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a joint client selection and resource configuration method called JCSRC for multi-task FL, aiming to maximize energy efficiency in environments with limited computation and communication resources and heterogeneous client devices. Firstly, we formalize this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem considering all these characteristics and prove its NP-hardness. To address this problem, we first design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based client selection method that selects appropriate clients for each task to train their models. The MARL method makes client selection decisions based on the clients’ data quality, energy efficiency, communication, and computation capacity to ensure fast convergence and energy efficiency. Then, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based resource configuration scheme that configures appropriate computation and bandwidth resources for each task on each client. The PSO scheme makes resource configuration decisions based on theoretically derived optimal CPU frequency and bandwidth to achieve high energy efficiency. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments to validate our proposed JCSRC. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, JCSRC can save energy consumption by up to 59% to achieve the target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance demands and stringent timing requirements of safety-critical systems like avionics and autonomous vehicles, research has focused on providing timing guarantees for the scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks in multicore systems. The structural complexity and timing anomalies make this problem challenging. Existing methods bound the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks through static analysis, but these bounds are complicated, difficult to validate, and often remain pessimistic for many scheduling scenarios. Runtime intervention can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is ineffective for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leads to non-work-conserving schedules, and incurs additional overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to identify timing anomalies in DAG scheduling scenarios within a system, providing tighter WCRT solutions. The static analysis first offers a sufficient anomaly test to directly identify some anomaly-free DAG scheduling scenarios. Leveraging a wide range of scheduling data collected from the running system or its simulator, we then apply a machine learning approach to train a binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of 99.5%. Identifying the anomaly status enables the application of more precise WCRT bounds for different scheduling scenarios, leading to improved system performance. Specifically, we shorten the WCRT bounds for anomaly-free DAG scheduling by an average of up to 21.58%, with a maximum reduction of up to 55.47% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {RowHammer poses a serious reliability challenge to modern DRAM systems. As technology scales down, DRAM resistance to RowHammer has decreased by 30× over the past decade, causing an increasing number of benign applications to suffer from this issue. However, existing defense mechanisms have three limitations: 1) they rely on inefficient mitigation techniques, such as time-consuming victim row refresh; 2) they do not reduce the number of effective RowHammer attacks, leading to frequent mitigations; and 3) they fail to recognize that frequently accessed data is not only a root cause of RowHammer but also presents an opportunity for performance optimization. In this paper, we observe that frequently accessed hot data plays a distinct role in security and efficiency: it can induce RowHammer by interfering with adjacent cold data, while also being performance-critical due to its frequent accesses. To this end, we propose Data Isolation via In-DRAM Cache (DIVIDE), a novel defense mechanism that leverages in-DRAM cache to isolate and exploit hot data. DIVIDE offers three key benefits: 1) It reduces the number of effective RowHammer attacks, as hot data in the cache cannot interfere with each other. 2) It provides a simple yet effective mitigation measure by isolating hot data from cold data. 3) It caches frequently accessed hot data, improving average access latency. DIVIDE employs a two-level protection structure: the first level mitigates RowHammer in cache arrays with high efficiency, while the second level addresses the remaining threats in normal arrays to ensure complete protection. Owing to the high in-DRAM cache hit rate, DIVIDE efficiently mitigates RowHammer while preserving both the performance and energy efficiency of the in-DRAM cache. At a RowHammer threshold of 128, DIVIDE with probabilistic mitigation achieves an average performance improvement of 19.6% and energy savings of 20.4% over DDR4 DRAM for fourcore workloads.

  abstract     = {Abstract—Asynchronous common subset (ACS) is a powerful paradigm enabling applications such as Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) and multi-party computation (MPC). The most efficient ACS framework in the information-theoretic setting is due to Ben-Or, Kelmer, and Rabin (BKR, 1994). The BKR ACS protocol has been both theoretically and practically impactful. BKR ACS has an O(log $n$) running time (where $n$ is the number of replicas) due to the usage of $n$ parallel asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances, impacting both performance and scalability. Indeed, for a network of 16∼64 replicas, the parallel ABA phase occupies about 95%∼97% of the total runtime. A long-standing open problem is whether we can build an ACS framework with O(1) time while not increasing the message or communication complexity of the BKR protocol. We resolve the open problem, presenting the first constant-time ACS protocol with O($n$3) messages in the information-theoretic and signature-free settings. Our key ingredient is the first information-theoretic and constant-time multivalued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol. Our results can improveߞasymptotically and concretelyߞvarious applications using ACS and MVBA. As an example, we implement FIN, a BFT protocol instantiated using our framework. Via a 121-server deployment on Amazon EC2, we show FIN reduces the overhead of the ABA phase to as low as 1.23% of the total runtime.},

Fluid kernels can be thought of as the intersection between embedded unikernels and general purpose monolithic kernels, allowing to seamlessly develop applications both in kernel space and user space in a unified way. This scalable kernel architecture can manage the trade-off between performance, code size, isolation and security. We compare our fluid kernel implementation, Miosix, to Linux and FreeRTOS on the same hardware with standard benchmarks. Compared to Linux, we achieve an average speedup of 3.5× and a maximum of up to 15.4×. We also achieve an average code size reduction of 84% and a maximum of up to 90%. By moving application code from user space to kernel space, an additional code size reduction up to 56% and a speedup up to 1.3× can be achieved. Compared to FreeRTOS, the use of Miosix only costs a moderate amount of code size (at most 47KB) for significant advantages in application performance with speedups averaging at 1.5× and up to 5×.},

Partitioners can be divided into vertex- and edge-based approaches. Recently, both approaches are employing a streaming heuristic to find approximate solutions. It is lightweight in space and time complexities, but suffers from suboptimal partitioning quality, especially for directed graphs where the explicit knowledge provided for heuristic is limited. This paper thereby proposes new heuristics for not only vertex-based but also edge-based partitioning. They improve quality by additionally utilizing implicit knowledge, which is embedded in the local streaming view and the global graph view. Memory reduction techniques are presented to extract this knowledge with negligible space costs. That preserves the lightweight advantages of streaming partitioning. Besides, we study parallel acceleration and restreaming, to further boost the partitioning efficiency and quality. Extensive experiments validate that our proposals outperform the state-of-the-art competitors.},

If a download is in progress, the request may be buffered (a Delayed Hit (D)) if the remaining download time is less than the response time, adding to latency and previously overlooked. We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT). We propose an online algorithm called Online-DRL, derive its competitive ratio, and evaluate it using Google, SHARCNet and synthetic datasets. Compared to a simple baseline method, Online-DRL has up to 7.41% higher latency, but 92.54% lower cost, for Google traces.

  abstract     = {Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a key solution to address the computational resource constraints of User Equipment (UE). To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement.

However, receivers may be at risk of being exposed to malicious or harmful content, thus undermining their trust in cloud service platforms. To this end, we introduce MBAC, a content-moderated bilateral access control framework for privacy-preserving cloud data sharing services, which allows receivers to acquire data from authentic senders while preserving their anonymity, and report malicious content in a verifiable manner, i.e., empowering the service provider to hold senders accountable. MBAC is built upon a novel primitive called franking broadcast ME (FBME), which generates a franking signature for the data by designating the service provider as the moderator to ensure accountability and deniability, and encrypts both the data and its franking signature while embedding the sender secret key for privacy and authenticity. We then present a concrete construction of FBME from key-private public key encryption, strongly unforgeable one time signature and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. Formal security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that MBAC provides efficient bilateral access control and content moderation for cloud data sharing services.},

Finally, the tasks are then assigned to cloud services to meet their sub-deadline requirements.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an effective solution to reduce latency and energy consumption by leveraging resources near end devices for task offloading. However, MEC faces significant challenges in meeting the requirements of 6 G networks, including limited computational resources, high mobility, and strict data privacy demands. Efficiently allocating edge resources while preserving privacy has become a critical issue for realizing the objectives of 6 G networks. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge computing power network (EdgeCPN) model that jointly leverages the computing resources of edge computing nodes and protects sensitive computing power information through differential privacy methods. In addition, we propose a task matching problem that aims to minimize the privacy-budget-weighted energy consumption while ensuring privacy protection and meeting task requirements. We propose a dynamic graph-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to find the optimal strategy for task matching and computing resource allocation with privacy protection.

  abstract     = {Image clustering is a crucial but open and challenging task in machine learning and computer vision. Deep image clustering methods have made significant advancements in largescale and high-dimensional image datasets, but they only explore clusters according to feature similarity. How to improve the semantic plausibility of these clusters remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we propose a joint semantic image clustering (SIC) with deep learning framework. Our key idea is to explore semantic clusters from both instance-level and clusterlevel perspectives. At the cluster level, we assume that the highest-confidence partitions possess reasonable semantic divisions; at the instance level, we assume that neighboring samples belong to the same semantic category. With the constraints of the cluster level and instance level, the intracluster compactness and interclass discrepancy are increased. Clustering results heavily rely on the quality of image representations. Therefore, we introduce strong data augmentations with three shared-weight backbone networks to learn the most inherent features. The experimental results on various image datasets demonstrate our framework’s superiority over a wide range of state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Social robot navigation presents a significant and complex challenge within indoor environments characterized by numerous obstacles and dynamic changes. Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a potent approach for addressing this issue. However, the primary attributes of such environments—their diversity and complexity—pose substantial challenges to the generalization capabilities of RL-based social robot navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a meta-reinforcement learning framework for social robot navigation that empowers robots to adapt to a variety of environments. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of utilizing social norms to guide social navigation for the first time. We employ field modeling to represent interactions among the environment, pedestrians, and robots. Historical pedestrian motion data is utilized as training input for physical information neural networks, which generate pedestrian movement vector fields within the environment. We then incorporate the similarity between the robot’s predicted motion state and its actual motion state into the reward function, guiding the robot’s learning process in alignment with social norms. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the robot’s social navigation capabilities. The code for our approach is publicly accessible at https://github.com/SiyiLoo/MetaRlNav-FTI.},

However, in real signals, the frequencies of these components are not precisely aligned and exhibit some differences. This paper introduces a novel multi-channel signal processing algorithm, termed Grouped Successive Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (GSMVMD). GSMVMD adopts a unique grouped expansion strategy to produce more effective co-frequencies, while we have also improved the algorithm frame-work by combining successive extraction strategy. GSMVMD first uses channel-by-channel Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to determine the center frequency of each channel, and then performs frequency-grouped normalization. Subsequently, a variational optimization model is established based on the grouped results, and the optimal solution for GSMVMD model is obtained using the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we conduct experiments using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as an example to verify the superiority of the GSMVMD algorithm, and design a Grouped Standard Deviation of degree (GSD) parameters to measure the connectivity between EEG channels, providing a new analytical perspective.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of networked systems is a significant problem due to the susceptibility of modern infrastructures to adversarial interference. A central component of this problem is how defensive resources should be allocated to mitigate the severity of potential attacks on the system. In this paper, we consider a General Lotto game where a defender and attacker deploy resources on the nodes of a network, and the objective is to secure as many links as possible. The defender secures a link only if it out-competes the attacker on both of its associated nodes. For bipartite networks, we completely characterize equilibrium payoffs and strategies for both the defender and attacker. Surprisingly, the resulting payoffs are the same for any bipartite graph. On arbitrary networks, we provide lower and upper bounds on the defender's max-min value. Notably, the equilibrium payoff from bipartite networks serves as the lower bound. This suggests that more connected networks are easier to defend against attacks. These findings are confirmed through numerical solutions of a convex optimization problem geared towards obtaining tighter upper bounds for arbitrary graph structures.},

To improve the estimation of summation terms involving exponentially dependent states, two refined free-matrix-based summation inequalities are established.

Most existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks: weak image-text semantic correlation and the hybridity of entity types in intermodality alignment. To this end, a general framework ProMNER is proposed for unimodal and multimodal NER tasks, which includes text-driven visual-modality enhancement (TVE) and prompt-guided type-related refinement and interaction (PTRI). Specifically, to alleviate the bias caused by irrelevant visual content, TVE employs cross-modal translation to generate visual representations that replace the original ones. Furthermore, the generated can serve directly as an additional input modality for NER, enabling the framework to be generalized to unimodal and multimodal NER tasks. Subsequently, to tackle the hybridity problem of intermodality entity alignment, type-filled question prompts are designed as guidance information to explicitly refine type-related visual representations. PTRI obtains type-specific multimodal representations by capturing semantic intermodality interactions for each type, and learns a comprehensive multimodal representation through dynamic weighting. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and generality of ProMNER in unimodal and multimodal NER tasks.},

This study aims to investigate effective mechanisms to mitigate involution by incorporating other-regarding preferences (ORP) into evolutionary game dynamics on complex networks and in well-mixed populations. Through numerical simulations conducted on square lattices and small-world networks, we systematically analyze the combined effects of crucial parameters including total social resources, the cost of more effort, fairness in resource distribution, and the intensity of ORP on the evolutionary dynamics of involution. Our findings reveal that increasing social resources generally exacerbates involution, whereas greater fairness in resource distribution alleviates it. Notably, the influence of more effort costs on involution is nonlinear and context-dependent, modulated by the interaction between resource abundance and ORP intensity. Critically, ORP emerges as a decisive factor: stronger ORP substantially suppresses involution, promotes the emergence and spatial stability of cooperative clusters, and reduces the equilibrium proportion of defectors. Theoretical analysis based on replicator dynamics validate our simulation results, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for the observed phenomena. This study not only advances the theoretical understanding of involution dynamics but also offers practical insights for addressing involution in real-world social systems. It highlights the importance of cultivating altruistic social norms and ensuring fairness in resource allocation to effectively mitigate involution.},

Most existing studies focus on encryption algorithms and access control to ensure data security. They often ignore the credibility of data providers, which affects data quality and reduces user participation. To address these issues, this article proposes a blockchain-based and reputation-enhanced health data trading model. A fine-grained reputation value calculation method based on the Beta distribution is introduced to objectively evaluate the behavior of data providers. Based on this, a consensus mechanism linked to reputation value is designed to improve consensus efficiency and avoid centralization of node selection. Furthermore, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the reward and punishment mechanism in the trading process. It explores the dynamic balance between platform cost and user willingness to share. Experimental results show that the model ensures secure health data sharing, while effectively improving data usability, system fairness, and user participation.},

With the wider application of GNN, recent work has revealed that it is vulnerable toward privacy leakage (e.g., property inference). How dose contrastive learning influence privacy leakage of GNN? To address the issue, for the first time we comprehensively evaluate the privacy leakage of contrastive learning for GNN. Specifically, we conduct property inference attack on GNN and evaluate the leakage from the perspective of graph augmentation, encoders, negative sampling and privacy preservation on seven graph contrastive learning (GCL) models with five datasets. Based on extensive experiments, several important insights are gained. 1) Contrastive learning will make GNN more vulnerable to property inference attack than supervised GNNs, e.g., the inference accuracy on GCL models is $\boldsymbol{\times\sim}$1.42 of that of supervised GNNs. 2) The strategy of node augmentation in contrastive learning will make the property of the graph easier to steal among all strategies, e.g., it achieves average inference accuracy (ACC) of 83.89% on the node augmentation. 3) Negative sampling based on rationale-aware will lead to easier leakage of graph properties than other strategies, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack is 100% when using rationale-aware. 4) The better performance results of the graph encoder, the more privacy leakage of the graph property, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack reaches 83.89% on average, and reaches 84.40% when GIN is used as the encoder. 5) The simpler the structure of the graph, the more vulnerable its graph properties are, i.e., the AIDS dataset achieved the highest ACC of 90.96 with the simplest structure. 6) Existing privacy-preserving methods for supervised GNN are deficient for GCL, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack after defence maintains 96% of the nondefensive ones. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analyze of the reasons behind these observations for better understanding of robust contrastive learning for GNN.},

However, current MI recognition approaches primarily utilize complex attention modules for higher recognition accuracy, consequently hindering real-time BCI implementation. Furthermore, existing methods often overlook inter-subject variability, leading to inadequate generalization of model. Additionally, traditional BCI systems lack closed-loop feedback from the machine to the brain. To address these limitations, we develop a novel closed-loop motor imagery BCI system, which encompasses a spectral-temporal refined attention network via contrastive mutual learning (STRA-CML) and a brain-controlled perceived hand exoskeleton. Specifically, we first design a spectral temporal refined attention block to capture the most discriminative spectral and temporal features. Second, we investigate a contrastive mutual learning strategy incorporating supervised-contrastive learning to enhance the generalization of our STRA-CML. Finally, a brain–machine closed-loop interaction platform based on perceived hand exoskeleton is developed to validate the feasibility of the proposed STRA-CML and provide kinesthetic and visual feedback synchronized with MI. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our STRA-CML, indicating that our STRA-CML achieves superior classification performance of 83.89% on BCI IV 2a dataset, 86.93% on BCI IV 2b dataset, and 82.79% on self-collected dataset.},

  abstract     = {All-in-one image restoration methods, as opposed to conventional image restoration methods, reconstruct images impaired by various degradations within a unified model, eliminating the need for separate network parameters for each task. However, current all-in-one image restoration approaches tackle various types of image degradation using an identical underlying model, neglecting the inherent variability in complexity across different image restoration tasks, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. To address this limitation, this article introduces the arbitrary routing framework (ARF), designed to effectively assess the difficulty of image restoration tasks and identify the most suitable network structure based on these complexities. This framework can be integrated with existing all-in-one image restoration models, enabling efficient inference by activating various proportions of the entire network, that is subnetworks, based on their task-specific complexities. More specifically, the ARF comprises two principal components: 1) the arbitrary routing backbone (ARB) and 2) a task-specific neural architecture search (T-NAS). The ARB incorporates a routing layer between consecutive convolutional groups, offering a wide array of potential subnetwork configurations while adding only negligible extra parameters. Concurrently, T-NAS autonomously identifies the most effective subnetworks for each image restoration task, optimizing both performance and efficiency through an efficiency-aware reward function. Comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that the ARF significantly improves performance metrics, that is, an increase of 0.31 in reconstruction PSNR, while also achieving a notable reduction in computational demands by 37.1% compared with the benchmark AirNet method. The code has been made available in the supplementary materials.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a dual-link coded event-triggered control (DL-CEC) for consensus in nonlinear MAS. To reduce the communication burden of signal transmission between the control box and actuator box or among agents and to enhance the security of information exchange, a dual-link coded scheme is proposed to compress each transmitted information into an L-length string. Furthermore, since the intrinsic complexity of nonlinear systems often causes TPP methods to fail in meeting constraints during the initial stages of operation, an adaptive prescribed performance (APP) scheme is introduced. By utilizing auxiliary functions, the APP is capable of dynamically adjusting performance boundaries, enabling seamless adaptation to varying initial system conditions. As a result, it ensures the tracking error is rigorously guaranteed to remain within a user-defined range over a prescribed time horizon, effectively accommodating diverse initial conditions of the system. By integrating DL-CEC with the APP method, the proposed control strategy ensures bounded consensus tracking with reduced communication cost and prescribed-time performance under arbitrary initial conditions. Simulation experiments corroborate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

To handle this problem, this article proposes a predefined-time safe cooperative control scheme for multiagent systems under output constraints, privacy preservation and unknown disturbances. At the communication layer, an encryption–decryption mechanism is developed to safeguard information exchange among agents, preventing internal states from being identified by eavesdroppers. At the control layer, to ensure strict adherence to output constraints regardless of whether the original command complies with safety limits, an improved boundary protection method is explored to generate a safety reference trajectory, which is subsequently used in the controller design. Adaptive laws are then formulated to counteract the effects of unknown nonlinearities and disturbances. Finally, by leveraging predefined-time stability theory, a predefined-time safe cooperative controller is designed to ensure error convergence within a user-defined settling time. Theoretical analysis rigorously confirms the closed-loop stability, and simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {As typical and complex mechatronic system, health state of the wind turbine (WT) is of significant importance to the sustained and reliable service. However, it is noted that influenced by the seasonal or fitful wind, WTs unavoidably serve in the dynamically varying environment. In this event, most of the currently available indicators expose deficiency in regard of the false or missed alarms due to the coupled condition interference. To address this issue and improve the reliability of the mechatronic system, a novel statistic discrepancy oriented cyclo-non-stationary (CNS) indicator is developed in this article. First, characteristics of the recorded degradation samples are revealed by a multiparametric model, during which the consistency is verified and improved by the hypothesis test. Second, a specific speed-dependent slicing (SDS) operator is then designed, aiming to alleviate the varying-speed-induced modulation interference at the different degradation stages. With this developed SDS operator, a CNS indicator, which can well adapt to the dynamically varying environment during the operating process, is subsequently developed by incorporating the resampling-based statistic discrepancy evaluating mechanism. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively characterize the health state of the transmission parts of the industrial WT under varying speed conditions.},

During network transmissions, the signals are exposed to FDI attacks, which occur randomly and follow a Bernoulli distribution. The primary objective is to develop a state estimation algorithm that can handle the TBP, sensor failures, and FDI attacks simultaneously.

By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient values of local objective functions and facilitating local information exchanges among neighboring agents, we construct a set of auxiliary systems that collaboratively seek the optimal solution. The prescribed-time DCO problem is then reformulated as a prescribed-time stabilization challenge of an interconnected error system. We propose a prescribed-time small-gain criterion to characterize the prescribed-time stabilization of the system, presenting a novel approach that enhances effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization methods for interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the auxiliary systems, we design innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers for the subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence is achieved through the introduction of time-varying gains that increase to infinity as time approaches the prescribed deadline. The Lyapunov function, along with prescribed-time mapping, is employed to establish the prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of internal signals. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through a numerical example.},

First, under the transition probability (TP)-based mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching topologies, a distributed objective trajectory achieves almost sure global exponential tracking of the desired formation trajectory. Second, a safe objective trajectory approach is designed by geometrically projecting the unsafe parts of the existing formation trajectory onto the boundary of the obstacle region. Finally, an integral-multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function (IMBLF) is proposed to allow agents to track the safe objective trajectory, where the IMBLF can further guarantee the safety of the MASs. One of the interesting merits of our results is that the impulsive increasing of Lyapunov function at switching instants which is necessary for classical analysis methods has been removed.

  abstract     = {Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has garnered extensive attention in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. VLN involves time series information, where historical observations contain rich contextual knowledge and play a crucial role in navigation. However, current methods do not explicitly excavate the connection between rich contextual information in history and the current environment, and ignore adaptive learning of clues related to the current environment. Therefore, we explore a Prompt Learning-based strategy which adaptively mines information in history that is highly relevant to the current environment to enhance the agent’s perception of the current environment and propose a history-guided prompt generation (HGPG) framework. Specifically, HGPG includes two parts, one is an entropy-based history acquisition module that assesses the uncertainty of the action probability distribution from the preceding step to determine whether historical information should be used at the current time step. The other part is the prompt generation module that transforms historical context into prompt vectors by sampling from an end-to-end learned token library. These prompt tokens serve as discrete, knowledge-rich representations that encode semantic cues from historical observations in a compact form, making them easier for the decision network to understand and utilize. In addition, we share the token library across various navigation tasks, mining common features between different tasks to improve generalization to unknown environments. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON, R2R-CE) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this study, the differences in vulnerability to hardware Trojan attacks are also considered in the MPSoC design process, and a security-driven task scheduling method is proposed to minimize both the design vulnerability and chip area under deadline constraints. First, the schedule length is iteratively optimized by a maximum weight independent set-based method that minimizes the vulnerability increment. Second, tasks are assigned to IP vendors with a minimized number of cores required by maximizing the core sharing of tasks. Finally, tasks are scheduled to time periods using the force-directed scheduling method.

It is natural to believe that the component solvers share common useful building blocks, thus knowledge transfer among them could be beneficial during the evolution. However, this has been neglected by existing studies. To fill this gap, we propose a transfer optimization framework for automatically co-evolving high-performance PAPs. Specifically, we develop a novel performance-oriented dynamic instance grouping strategy to divide problem instances into groups, each of which is associated with a subpopulation of individuals tasked with evolving a component solver. Additionally, the framework incorporates an adaptive knowledge transfer strategy that automatically identifies when and how to transfer knowledge among instance groups. We conducted extensive experiments on the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a famously challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The comprehensive experimental results from three public benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art VRP solvers and automatic PAP construction methods.},

  abstract     = {In expensive multitask optimization problems (ExMTOPs), multiple complex tasks must be optimized simultaneously under limited computational budgets. Existing approaches, often based on surrogate models, aim to approximate objective functions but struggle to generalize across heterogeneous tasks, depend on task-specific sampling, and require frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm–Single Step Generative Model (MFEA-SSG), a meta-learning-inspired framework that learns to generate high-quality solutions across tasks. Inspired by meta-learning, we treat each random shuffle of the decision variables as a unique pseudo-task, training the model on a distribution of these tasks to learn a task-agnostic prior about the structure of elite solutions. This process disrupts task-specific dependencies, allowing the model to learn transferable structures from recomposed samples. We then adopt a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of optimal solutions, enabling knowledge transfer across tasks without directly approximating objective functions. To reduce inference cost, we introduce a student model distilled from the diffusion process. Unlike conventional diffusion models that denoise iteratively, the student generates solutions in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments on both general multitask benchmarks and a real-world protein mutation prediction scenario demonstrate that MFEA-SSG achieves high-quality solutions with fast convergence and low computational cost under limited evaluation budgets, outperforming state-of-the-art general and ExMTOPs algorithms.},

  abstract     = {You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) represents the state-of-the-art in object detection models. With the emergence of various applications utilizing small domain-specific datasets and limited computing resources for extensive model training and deployment, there is an increasing demand for customized lightweight YOLO architectures. In this paper, we propose a general NeuroEvolution-based method, termed YOLO-Light, designed to automatically create lightweight variants of YOLO architectures tailored to object detection tasks across diverse scenarios. For a given task, YOLO-Light first initializes a population of minimal YOLO architectures and subsequently evolves these models within a novel parallel-chain evolutionary space. This process employs a diversity-protecting evolutionary search strategy until some architectures meet the expected performance standards. During evolution, YOLO-Light incorporates a dynamic evolution regulation mechanism to adjust the evolutionary configuration, thereby enhancing efficiency based on the current evolutionary state. We applied YOLO-Light to generate lightweight YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 architectures for object detection on the Roboflow 100 small dataset collection, which comprises 100 diverse datasets spanning 7 distinct imagery domains, with a total of 224,714 images and 829 classes. Our experiments focused on 20 datasets ranging from 105 to 8,992 images and 1 to 53 classes. The experimental results show that YOLO-Light reduced the number of parameters by 54–95%, while maintaining or improving mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to standard YOLO architectures. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLO-Light in generating lightweight, task-specific YOLO architectures for resource-constrained object detection tasks. The code repository of YOLO-Light is available on GitHub at https://github.com/BruceShine/YOLO-Light.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) information. The IVIF information excels at capturing the dynamic and ambiguous nature of user preferences. An interpretable quantitative evaluation method based on IVIF is proposed to provide reliable prior knowledge for decision-making. The novel reward functions account for both group and individual characteristics, achieving a balance in their timely responses. In order to solve the problem of mixed-integer second-order cone and semidefinite programming (MI-SOCSDP) with sparse uncertain data, an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) is developed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the consistency between the charging/discharging decision-making processes and users' fuzzy preferences. Moreover, the proposed method minimizes the worst-case expected cost over the ambiguity sets of probability distributions, effectively verifying the robustness of the model.},

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven notable progress in single image dehazing, their performance remains fundamentally constrained by the limited local receptive fields of convolutional operations, which impede the capture of global structural dependencies. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image synthesis, offering global insights into structure, texture, and color. The fuzzy prior, a probabilistic knowledge acquired through adversarial training in GANs, plays a pivotal role in robust dehazing. Motivated by this, we propose the fuzzy prior guided dehazing network (FPGDN). Our framework begins with a novel module that distills the fuzzy prior by translating an edge map into a color image, simultaneously capturing global structural, local textural, and color information. Subsequently, a dehazing network is constructed, leveraging this fuzzy prior. While the fuzzy prior captures rich color and texture features, the generated images may exhibit color shifts relative to the original scene. To remedy this, a CNN network is employed to capture local nuances and refine the dehazing outcome. Extensive experiments substantiate that the proposed FPGDN achieves superior dehazing performance on a variety of real and synthetic hazy images.},

  abstract     = {In skeleton-based gesture recognition tasks, existing approaches based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) struggle to capture the synergistic actions of nonadjacent graph nodes and the information conveyed by their long-range dependencies. Combining spatial and temporal transformers is a promising solution to address the limitation, inspired by the advantage of transformer in assessing nonadjacent long-range dependencies, but there lacks an effective strategy to integrate the spatial and temporal information extracted by these transformers. Therefore, this article proposes the spatial-temporal alternating graph convolution transformer (ST-GCN-AltFormer), which connects the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with the spatial-temporal alternating transformer (AltFormer) architecture. In the AltFormer architecture, the spatial-temporal transformer branch employs a spatial transformer to capture information from specific frames, and uses a temporal transformer to analyze its evolution over the entire temporal range. Meanwhile, the temporal-spatial transformer branch extracts temporal information from specific nodes using a temporal transformer, and integrates it with a spatial transformer. The fusion enhances accurate spatial-temporal information extraction. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracies of 97.5%, 95.8%, 94.3%, 92.8%, and 98.31% on the large-scale 3D hand gesture recognition (SHREC’17 Track), Dynamic Hand Gesture 14-28 (DHG-14/28), and leap motion dynamic hand gesture (LMDHG) dynamic gesture datasets, respectively.},

This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. Unlike prior TDE methods that mainly rely on post-hoc querying or prompt selection to elicit memorized content from a fixed model, our strategy directly alters the model’s parameters to intensify its retention of the pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LLMusing DetectGPT. We subsequently fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on these membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LLMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.},

The second pertains to verifying that the inferences are derived from the designated neural network model. Although Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) are typically adopted to mitigate such issues, the major challenge lies in achieving privacy preservation and verifiability simultaneously. In this study, we address both issues by proposing VSecNN, a verifiable and privacy-preserving neural network inference scheme. Specifically, we integrate MPC with the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocol to achieve zero-knowledge proof generation for multiple parties. Subsequently, we perform adaptive optimizations on the multi-party proof generation approach to align with the neural network, thereby achieving both privacy-preserving capabilities and verifiability. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in the efficiency. For example, the computation time for completing our multi-party proof generation could be as low as 1.7 times that of the single-party proof generation, while the verification requires only 169ms on the MNIST dataset.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of designing cost-effective defense strategies to minimize the risk of successful attack paths. To this end, we propose a non-Markovian security game framework on labeled attack graphs to simulate the attack-defense process in industrial control systems. Compared with existing methods, where the cost of exploiting a vulnerability is considered constant, we consider a more dynamic and realistic case where the exploitation cost is discounted with the number of exploitations. Moreover, a state-decomposition based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to obtain the Nash equilibrium of the proposed non-Markovian security game. A case study on a simulated industrial control system is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the discounting exploitation cost could greatly alter the attack and subsequently the defense strategies. In comparison to traditional static intrusion response approaches, our non-Markovian approach offers a more realistic and adaptive framework to anticipate evolving attack paths and allocate defense resources.},

  abstract     = {Passwords remain one of the most widely used forms of authentication in modern systems. However, their inherent predictability, stemming from common user behaviors in password creation, renders password-based authentication vulnerable to guessing attacks. To balance memorability and security, users often construct isomorphic variants of a base password by altering its structure, such as transforming 123abc into 1a2b3c. These variants pose significant challenges to traditional password guessing models. In particular, mainstream approaches such as Markov model and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) model struggle to capture the structural relationships among these variants. To address this challenge, we propose PassGIN, a password guessing framework based on Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By modeling a password as a graph, PassGIN captures both local adjacency and character rearrangement patterns, enabling the model to distinguish subtle structural differences between base passwords and their isomorphic variants. To further enhance performance, we introduce PassCluster, a dynamic edge-weighting mechanism that leverages adjacency frequencies observed in large-scale password datasets. This allows GIN to more effectively learn structural variations and generate accurate guesses. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that PassGIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both intra-site and cross-site password guessing scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 23.49% and 74.53%, respectively.},

However, hop-by-hop routing has not been widely deployed since it suffers from route capture attacks, and most of the countermeasures require the source participate in the route extension indirectly, help verify the selection of next hop by intermediate nodes, thus introduces communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing scheme called Jump Routing. In jump routing, the route extension follows the jumping way, that each relay chooses the successor of the next hop rather than the next hop itself. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to route in the jumping way. In addition, to defend route capture attacks, enhance data privacy, and defend collusion attacks, we propose multiple schemes including jump verification, jump encryption, and corporative jump verification. Different from previous measures on route capture attacks, jump routing does not need the participation of the source, but deals with the attack by intermediate nodes only. We manage to realize the full jump routing prototype, and the evaluation results show that our jump routing is scalable, lightweight, and resilient.},

  abstract     = {Combating counterfeit products is crucial for maintaining a healthy market. Recently, Copy Sensitive Graphical Codes (CSGC) have garnered significant attention due to their high sensitivity to illegal physical copying. Copy Detection Patterns (CDP) and Two-Level QR Codes (2LQR code) are two representative methods. CDP offers high efficiency and low cost, enabling use in document authentication and product anti-counterfeiting, and has achieved broad commercial adoption. In contrast, 2LQR code, as a consumer-grade document authentication solution, provides additional private message sharing functionalities. We observe that both the CDP and 2LQR code can be synthesized using textured patterns. To this end, we propose a flexible framework that integrates the stochastic anti-counterfeiting properties of CDP with the private message sharing of 2LQR code. Specifically, we model CDP as a random noise image composed of multiple textured patterns similar to those in 2LQR code, where each pattern represents an informative digit. Thus, both codes can be generated through textured pattern design. We formulate this as a constrained optimization framework called Mixed-Bit Sampling Marking (MSM). The objective incorporates white pixel ratio and spatial randomness, with constraints defined by a flexible modulation function (e.g., DCT or Pearson similarity), customizable to user needs. A two-step sampling algorithm solves the optimization. We demonstrate CDP and 2LQR codes generated via MSM and validate their ability to inherit advantages from both approaches. Experiments show that MSM-generated texture patterns effectively synthesize both CDPs and 2LQR codes, preserving their advantages while offering a novel, flexible solution for document authentication.},

  abstract     = {Action Quality Assessment (AQA), which aims at the automatic and fair evaluation of athletic performance, has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, athletes are often in rapid movement and the corresponding visual appearance variances are subtle, making it challenging to capture fine-grained pose differences and leading to poor estimation performance. Furthermore, most common AQA tasks, such as diving in sports, are usually divided into multiple sub-actions, each of which contains different durations. However, existing methods focus on segmenting the video into fixed frames, which disrupts the temporal continuity of sub-actions resulting in unavoidable prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel action quality assessment method through hierarchically pose-guided multi-stage contrastive regression. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale dynamic visual-skeleton encoder to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal visual and skeletal features. Compared to mask or auxiliary visual features, skeletal features provide a more accurate representation during athletic movements. Then, a procedure segmentation network is introduced to separate different sub-actions and obtain segmented features. Afterwards, the segmented visual and skeletal features are both fed into a multi-modal fusion module as physics structural priors, to guide the model in learning refined activity similarities and variances. Finally, a multi-stage contrastive learning regression approach is employed to learn discriminative representations and output prediction results.

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration, which estimates a rigid transformation matrix between two point clouds, is a fundamental process in numerous applications. While existing detector-free techniques present exceptional performance, they overlook the extraction of hybrid local features that capture correlations between points and their neighbours, thereby limiting the quality of point cloud recognition. Moreover, these approaches typically treat point clouds as sequential data and employ the transformer to integrate global context from all points, which inevitably introduces interference from irrelevant regions, hence affecting the registration accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel detector-free approach AGHL to address these challenges. For the first issue, AGHL introduces a hybrid local feature perception module that designs two parallel branches to concurrently extract low-level and high-level local features, which effectively encode the correlations between each point and its neighborhood points in both Euclidean space and high-dimensional feature space. For the second issue, AGHL develops an anchor-guided cross attention that adheres to the local geometric consistency to constrain the network’s attention on reliable anchors, thereby effectively suppressing interference from irrelevant regions. Benefiting from these techniques, AGHL achieves impressive point cloud registration accuracy across all synthetic, indoor, and outdoor datasets. Furthermore, we build an experimental platform and conduct a real-world robot localization experiment, with results showing the strong generalization ability of AGHL.},

  abstract     = {Hashing is an effective technique for large-scale image retrieval. However, traditional hashing models typically follow a closed-set assumption, which fails to satisfy the practicality of real-world tasks. In this paper, we explore a meaningful yet overlooked question: is there a hashing paradigm that not only supports rehearsal-free online incremental coding for single-pass data streams but also adapts to potentially expanding concept spaces in open environments? Instead of presetting fixed bit lengths, we suggest adjusting the bit length dynamically based on the number of encountered categories, meanwhile enabling bit extension of existing hash codes to match the adaptive code lengths without knowledge forgetting. Therefore, we propose a Bit-extendable IncremenTal haShing (BITS) method for image retrieval in open environments. Specifically, we identify a blurry incremental setup to better simulate realistic scenarios, revisiting the widely-used data-incremental and class-incremental settings. With this challenging setup, a three-phase framework is designed to efficiently perform incremental hashing, which jointly solves online continual coding and bit extension with adaptive code lengths. Through the well-designed hashing paradigm, BITS achieves comparable performance to offline hashing methods while significantly saving computational resources. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our BITS in dynamic scenarios. The source code is available at https://github.com/yxinwang/BITS.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal Moment-based Robust Reversible Watermarking (OM-RRW) is crucial for intellectual property protection, providing the dual benefits of robustness and reversibility. However, OM-RRW embeds watermarks into visually sensitive global low-frequency features, which easily leads to ring-like distortions that expose watermark locations, making them vulnerable to removal through image inpainting. To address this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to introduce an innovative strategy to eliminate these visible distortions, thereby overcoming OM-RRW’s inherent limitations. The strategy innovates on two fronts: first, it customizes varying embedding step sizes based on the stability differences of moment values to minimize distortion; second, it designs a texture-aware adaptive basis function fine-tuning strategy. This strategy adjusts the representation capability of the basis functions in different regions based on the human eye’s sensitivity to various texture areas, helping to avoid visible ring-like distortions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using Polar Harmonic Transform (PHT) moments, comprising three moments that exhibit remarkable performance in existing OM-RRW methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can embed 128-bit watermarks with no visible distortions while minimizing the loss of robustness. In addition, this paper finds that OM-RRW demonstrates satisfactory robustness against VAE watermark removal attacks.},

However, the inherent challenges of vascular imaging—such as sparsity, fine granularity, low contrast, data distribution variability, and the critical need for preserving topological integrity—make generalized vessel segmentation particularly complex. While specialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical regions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability and generalization. General-purpose segmentation models introduced in medical imaging often fail to address critical vascular characteristics, including the connectivity of segmentation results. In this study, we propose OVS-Net, an optimized vessel segmentation framework designed to generalize across diverse vessel structures and imaging modalities. It introduces a dual-branch architecture design for improving small vessel segmentation and a morphology-aware correction module to preserve vascular topology and connectivity. We compiled a comprehensive multi-modality dataset from 17 sources to train and benchmark the proposed OVS-Net against 6 SAM-based methods and 17 expert models under various conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy, generalization, and a 34.6% improvement in connectivity, underscoring its potential for clinical applications.

Normalizing Flow (NF)-based methods have been introduced to address this issue, as they explicitly model the distribution of input data and achieve significant performance in VAD. However, existing NF-based methods are confined to Euclidean space, limiting their ability to model action hierarchies. While effective at capturing local joint dynamics and short-term temporal variations, they fail to encode kinematic dependencies and long-term pose evolution, ultimately struggling to discern ambiguous anomalies that deviate minimally from normal motion. In contrast, hyperbolic representation learning, with its ability to model hierarchical and complex relationships among actions, offers a promising solution to enhance the discriminative power between similar skeletal actions. Motivated by this, we propose a novel Dual-Space Normalizing Flow (DSNF) method. Specifically, we design a Dual-Space Parallel Graph Convolutional Network (DSPGCN) that synergistically integrates the strengths of both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries to simultaneously capture local detail features of poses and intrinsic hierarchical relationships of actions. To enhance the model’s focus on discriminative features, we design an Adaptive Weighted Approximation Mass (AWAM) loss that dynamically adjusts weights to impose stronger constraints on regions with low discriminability in the dual space, encouraging the model to focus more on key discriminative features in hyperbolic space that reflect complex relationships between actions.

At the same time, active learning (AL) has shown great potential in reducing annotation costs in related tasks, which can maximize model performance within very limited labeled data. In this paper, we explore active learning for vision-based 3DOD for the first time. Inspired by the entropy analysis, we involve three concerns to characterize the sample informativeness: sample diversity in input space, feature informativeness in BEV space, and result distribution in prediction space. Based on these concerns, we propose a novel AL framework named HMAD, which utilizes Height Modeling and Adaptive Diversity-based sampling for comprehensive informativeness characterization. In HMAD, we first propose a novel height-guided adversarial module in BEV space, which measures the informativeness of height modeling for 2D-to-3D mapping in an adversarial manner. Furthermore, Budget-aware SpatioTemporal diversity Sampling (BSTS) and Class Balance Sampling (CBS) are proposed to adaptively measure the sample informativeness in input and prediction space, respectively. Finally, the three components are integrated into a two-stage sampling strategy, with which the most informative samples can be selected and annotated for the next iteration. Experiments evidence that HMAD achieves comparable performances by only using 50% annotated training data, and can generalize well on different conditions.},

Existing methods typically perform under a constrained assumption that each text instance originates from a specific single-language domain. However, this assumption is inaccurate in multilingual scenarios, as it overlooks the inherent cross-lingual knowledge, i.e., the incremental sharing problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised cross-lingual knowledge discovery framework, CrossKnow, tailored for IMLTR tasks. Specifically, an innovative shared knowledge discovery strategy is developed to identify potential shared knowledge by leveraging prediction consistency across multiple recognizers, thus eliminating the reliance on language labels of all characters. Building upon this shared knowledge, we further design a multi-granularity, multi-task language domain discriminator to capture dependency relationships among incremental languages, which could adequately guide the hierarchical sequence decoding. By mining shared knowledge, CrossKnow can not only mitigate the forgetting of old knowledge but also efficiently achieve cross-lingual knowledge transfer, thereby promoting the continual learning of incremental multilingual text recognition models. Experiments on two widely used datasets, MLT17 and MLT19, demonstrate the superiority of CrossKnow. Compared to methods that leverage additional language supervision of characters, CrossKnow achieves competitive performance while eliminating storage overhead and improving computation efficiency.},

Efficient interleaver design is crucial in improving the error-correcting performance of Turbo codes; therefore, understanding the low-weight input patterns specific to the selected RSC code is essential. Existing graph-based search algorithms face increasing complexity as the constraint length of the RSC code increases. To address this issue, we introduce a method that directly derives the critical low-weight input patterns (up to Hamming weight 4) from the generator function of the RSC code. The proposed method addresses the complexity issue and can be extended to non-recursive systematic convolutional (NRSC) codes by modifying the generator function. To validate our novel method, we compare the union bound obtained using our approach to that obtained via the transfer function method and the simulation results for selected RSC codes.

We give sufficient conditions for permutations over Fpn to attain a differential uniformity of pn−1 for n ≥ 3. Furthermore, it is proven that for these permutations, the maximal 2-norm of Walsh coefficients remains bounded by pn−1, provided either the last n − 1 entries of the input mask or the last n − 1 entries of the output mask form a nonzero vector. As an application, we design a new FHE-friendly stream cipher named YuS based on a new quadratic permutation over Fp3 and a fixed linear mapping. According to our implementation, achieves YuS faster evaluation times and higher throughput compared to Masta, Pasta, Pastav2 and HERA in almost all instances for both BGV and BFV schemes at 80-bit and 128-bit security levels.},

Conditions for uniqueness of reconstruction of signals that are sparse with respect to dictionaries or, more generally, to non-linear locally Lipschitz mappings are obtained as special cases. Furthermore, we show that a frame multiplier matrix is full superregular, i.e., that all its minors are nonzero, for almost all frame symbol vectors, provided that the underlying frames are full spark and sufficiently redundant. Since Gabor frames are full spark for almost all windows, we study Gabor multipliers in more detail and are able to derive improved constants for some scenarios.

  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as a promising approach to improving fuel efficiency, safety, and traffic flow. However, achieving robust and efficient control in heterogeneous CAV platoons remains challenging, especially under uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based platoon controllers often ignore model uncertainties or rely on centralized training, limiting their scalability and robustness in real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a fully distributed, model-free RL framework integrated with a robust compensator for optimal platoon control of heterogeneous vehicles with unknown dynamics. The RL agent simultaneously learns the optimal control policy and estimates control-relevant dynamic parameters using only local input-output data, without requiring explicit vehicle models. These estimates are then used in real time to construct a disturbance-rejection input that ensures robust trajectory tracking. A distributed observer based on consensus theory is embedded within the hybrid controller to estimate leader-relative reference trajectories using only local neighbor information, eliminating the need for global communication. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence and bounded tracking errors under dynamic uncertainties. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulation (MiTaS) platform, combining the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with MATLAB, demonstrating improved tracking, damping of traffic oscillations, and up to 15.8% fuel savings compared to recent RL-based methods.},

To predict the trajectory of pedestrian, most existing methods try to learn the probability distribution of real pedestrian trajectories and then independently sample multiple times from this distribution to obtain a set of possible future paths. However, naively learning the distribution of real-world trajectories leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we design a model-agnostic reinforcement learning-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. This framework models pedestrian trajectory generation as a denoising process, which is further formulated as a multi-step decision-making process. In our framework, we subtly design a reward function, which is used to optimize the diffusion model with policy-based reinforcement learning. We make evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including ETH/UCY and SDD datasets, where our approach achieves promising results.

  abstract     = {Detection and repair of pavement distress in time are crucial to maximize functional performance and service life, while minimizing maintenance costs on extensive roadway networks. Manual distress detection is labor intensive and error prone. While deep learning techniques offer unparalleled capabilities for automated and accurate pixel-level pavement distress segmentation, their reliance on extensive manual annotations remains a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose an open-ended self-supervised framework enabling flexible integration of various pretext tasks for pavement distress segmentation without manual annotations. We introduce a spatial contexts-informed pretext task that automatically generates pseudo labels by leveraging the highly consistent semantic information inherent across continuous pavement images within localized areas. Amulti-line parallel network architecture is then employed, where each line extracts a distinct deep representation aligned with the pseudo-label generation process. These representations are jointly optimized through a shared weight update scheme augmented by momentum encoders to capture long-range dependencies. Avision transformer processes the input images during inference, utilizing self-attention to highlight distressed regions based on the learned representations for precise segmentation. Extensive evaluations validate the performance of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by 0.075 mIoU on average, while remarkably surpassing weakly supervised techniques requiring manual image-level annotations. These results are far more promising given that our self-supervised approach avoids human labeling costs, striking a trade-off between model effectiveness and annotation efficiency for large-scale deployments. It helps transportation agencies to realize timely, proactive infrastructure maintenance through scalable, accurate distress monitoring over extensive road networks.},

Firstly, unknown dynamic uncertainties of the vehicle are approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Building on this neural network approximation under FDI attacks, a novel state observer is developed to estimate the vehicle’s state, restore the communication protocol when the communication link is attacked, and address the complex coupling issues between vehicle states. Furthermore, finite-time prescribed performance control inputs are designed based on the constructed sliding surfaces to ensure practical finite-time stability of the 2-D plane vehicle platoon. This method facilitates vehicle multi-lane fusion within a finite time while guaranteeing platoon performance and preventing collisions. Finally, numerical simulations and comparative analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, involving one leader vehicle and six followers.},

However, effectively integrating high-dimensional data from perception sensors, such as RGB cameras, into control design remains challenging. This paper investigates a car-following longitudinal control problem in autonomous driving, where a following car equipped with an RGB camera senses visual information from a leading car. To address the complexities of data integration, we propose a Binarized Digital Image Pixels Mask (BDIPM) method integrated with a backstepping control framework. The BDIPM method enhances useful visual pixels while filtering out irrelevant signals, enabling the scalarization of high-dimensional image data into a format suitable for control design with rigorous analysis footing. By constructing an error model that maps image-derived features to real-state variables, we establish a sensory pixel-based feedback control law. CARLA results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to the baseline methods, our algorithm shows improvement in both stability and computational speed, which highlights its potential for robust perception-driven control in autonomous driving scenarios.},

Previous methods predominantly concentrate on optimizing passage strategies for individual intersections in isolation. However, they often neglect global traffic conditions and task priorities in closed, multi-intersection transportation scenarios, leading to localized congestion. In this work, we propose a method that aims to optimize the passing order of intersections from a global and long-term perspective to enhance overall transportation efficiency. Specifically, we model the coordination of multiple unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent sequential decision problem and solve it through a two-stage method. In the planning stage, we construct fully connected undirected graphs based on vehicle conflict relationships and use the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to learn the global priorities. In the scheduling stage, the local vehicle scheduling is formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem. The learned global priorities are soft constraints, while a hybrid filtered beam search determines safe and efficient CAV passing orders. Extensive offline experiments and online tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in minimizing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-cloud computation (VCC) is vital for urban intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The realization of VCC relies on the proper deployment and application of intelligent infrastructures, such as Roadside Units (RSUs) for communication and Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) for computation. However, the time-varying mobility characteristics of individual vehicles and uncertain service demands pose challenges for effective infrastructure deployment. This paper proposes a two-stage deployment optimization model based on real vehicle trajectory data to enhance the connected vehicles-RSUs-ECSs chain for information propagation and task offloading. In the first stage, a hybrid communication networking model is developed to design an information propagation tree, leading to a tri-objective optimization problem for RSU deployment, solved using NSGA-II to generate Pareto frontier solutions. The second stage focuses on ECS deployment through a bi-objective optimization model, incorporating chance-constrained planning to handle variability of RSU computation demand caused by dynamic vehicle distributions. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method is applied for hierarchical optimization, and an enhanced tabu search (ETS) algorithm is employed to efficiently determine optimal solutions. Subsequently, an online task reallocation and relaying mechanism based on sequential decision-making is developed to enhance system resilience under extreme scenarios. Validation on the Anhui Xuancheng dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves communication service capacity and balances computational loads. This research contributes to the continuous and optimal deployment of smart infrastructures to advance the application of ITS for sustainable urban mobility.},

Nofly zones were modeled as polygons, and a cubic spline-based lateral avoidance strategy was implemented. Then, a hybrid optimization framework integrating analytic solutions, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed. PSO’s exploration capability was retained, while DRL dynamically adjusted swarm hyperparameters based on swarm behavior to improve efficiency and solution quality by balancing exploration and exploitation. In the end, numerical simulations under multiple scenarios validated full constraint satisfaction, with a mean terminal state error below 0.92%. The DRL-PSO framework demonstrated adaptability and efficiency in rapid trajectory computation, achieving an average runtime of approximately 1.0 s.

This leads to critical object data being obscured by excessive background information during data fusion, complicating effective integration. Additionally, efficiently leveraging historical perception data remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free motion attribute extraction module that captures motion features between consecutive frames, enabling more efficient utilization of historical information to enhance current perception. Specifically, we design two temporal modules to comprehensively explore both ego and collaborators’ historical information. Furthermore, we propose a method that simultaneously considers the relationships between global appearance features and local motion features of shared information, thereby enabling better integration of foreground object data during collaboration. We validate our algorithm through experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world collaborative benchmarks. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed MHCPP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of 3D object detection and prediction tasks.},

Since the features of vulnerable targets conflict, it is difficult for the target detection algorithm to use the complete target features fully. Therefore, it is imperative to fully mine the features of the feature conflict targets for the detector design. Although there have been methods to enhance the integrity of target features based on target edge features, the edge’s ability to emphasize the target’s internal regions is limited, and there is no guarantee that the emphasized features must be internal features of the target. To this end, we propose DEGNet, which emphasizes the internal features of the target by diffusion and superposition of the target edge in the eight neighborhoods and designs DEAM to guide the target detection network to pay more attention to the internal features of the target from the feature level. In addition, we propose CS-NMS, which adaptively adjusts the degree of influence of the category on the screening of detection boxes. We constructed an urban road vulnerable target detection dataset SC8D with feature conflict scenes and tested the performance of the proposed method in this dataset and real-world scenarios. The results show that our method outperforms existing methods and can effectively apply to fragile object detection in feature conflict scenarios.},

Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks.

To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent’s state space. Extending prior work on ProMis’ reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models.

AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming.

  abstract     = {Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure ‘natural ordinal relation’ common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and OR tasks.},

First, we propose a multimodal semantic matching module that projects multimodal inputs into a shared joint embedding semantic space to determine whether the semantics between multimodalities are mismatching. Second, we propose an adaptive subject-focused guide module, which adaptively references images to learn subject tokens based on the multimodal semantic matching results. With these subject tokens, we are able to focus on the subject information, providing precise guidance for summary generation. We conduct extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and compare ASSM with 17 existing models. The experimental results regarding ROUGE, BERTScore, and MoverScore show that the proposed ASSM model outperforms all competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance and suggesting the effectiveness of our proposal.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased a strong generalization ability to handle various natural language processing tasks to answer users' arbitrary questions and generate specific-domain content. Compared with graph learning models, LLMs enjoy superior advantages in addressing the challenges of generalizing graph tasks by eliminating the need for training graph learning models and reducing the cost of manual annotation. However, LLMs are sequential models for textual data, but graphs are non-sequential topological data. It is challenging to adapt LLMs to tackle graph analytics tasks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of existing LLM studies on graph data, which summarizes the relevant graph analytics tasks solved by advanced LLM models and points out the existing challenges and future directions. Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) in terms of three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graphs and LLMs, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning, and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of the discussed LLM-GGA models. We also explore open problems and future directions in this exciting interdisciplinary research area of LLMs and graph analytics.},

  abstract     = {Clustering as a fundamental technique in data mining and machine learning, aims to partition data into meaningful groups based on the inherent relationships among data. However, traditional clustering algorithms typically assume convex hyperspherical geometry of data, where the clusters have clearly defined boundaries and do not overlap. In contrast, real-world data often exhibits complex and non-convex geometries, which makes these assumptions ineffective and lead to inaccurate clustering results that fail to capture the intrinsic structure. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a novel granular clustering based on an enhanced granularity representation, which further refines the principle of justifiable granularity. By introducing a more precise and flexible hyper-box granulation mechanism, the method dynamically adapts to the topology of data, thereby improving clustering accuracy. By defining the degree of aggregation and discreteness between data points, the importance of attributes in the feature space is quantified, leading to the design of a novel hyper-box feature selection (HBFS) algorithm. This algorithm integrates the granular clustering principle to optimize the feature selection process, reducing the impact of redundant features and noise, thus improving clustering efficiency and interpretability. To validate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on fifteen publicly available datasets, comparing the performance of HBFS algorithm with classical and state-of-art feature selection methods. The results and the statistical significance tests show that HBFS significantly outperforms existing feature selection methods across various evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval, where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED) are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region (G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e., graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference. Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph similarity.},

A Tensor Representation Learning (TRL) model enables extracting valuable knowledge form a dynamic network via learning low-dimensional representation of a target nonstandard tensor. Nevertheless, the representation learning ability of existing TRL models are limited for a nonstandard tensor due to its inability to accurately represent the specific nature of the nonstandard tensor, i.e., mode imbalance, high-dimension, and incompleteness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a Mode-Aware Tucker Networkbased Tensor Representation Learning (MTN-TRL) model with three-fold ideas: a) designing a mode-aware Tucker network to accurately represent the imbalanced mode of a nonstandard tensor, b) building an MTN-based high-efficient TRL model that fuses both data density-oriented modeling principle and adaptive parameters learning scheme, and c) theoretically proving the MTN-TRL model's convergence.

One promising approach is to develop educational agents to facilitate high-quality completion of various educational tasks. In recent years, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has breathed new life into educational agents and pushed them into a new stage of intelligence. This survey tries to conduct a comprehensive and thorough investigation of LLM-based agents in education. First, the developments of educational agents are presented as background information. Subsequently, we propose a unified architecture for LLM-based educational agents, including perception, profiling, memory, reasoning, and action modules, and summarize two primary methods (i.e., fine-tuning and prompt engineering) for equipping them with abilities. Next, we categorize the potential applications of LLM-based educational agents across the “teaching-learning-assessment-research” chain, and discover that LLM-based educational agent can play significant roles in various educational tasks. Furthermore, we reveal that when assessing the effectiveness of LLM-based educational agents, subjective evaluation remains dominant, supplemented by objective evaluation. Finally, the open issues and future research directions in this field are discussed from multiple perspectives. We hope that this survey can provide valuable insights and inspirations for researchers and practitioners to enhance the further development of educational agents in the future.},

  abstract     = {Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) is fundamental for the reliable, low-latency networks that will enable the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Wi-Fi has historically been considered unfit for TSN, as channel contention and collisions prevent deterministic transmission delays. However, this issue can be overcome by using Target Wake Time (TWT), which enables the access point to instruct Wi-Fi stations to wake up and transmit in non-overlapping TWT Service Periods (SPs), and sleep in the remaining time. In this paper, we first formulate the TWT Acceptance and Scheduling Problem (TASP), with the objective to schedule TWT SPs that maximize traffic throughput and energy efficiency while respecting Age of Information (AoI) constraints. Then, due to TASP being NP-hard, we propose the TASP Efficient Resolver (TASPER), a heuristic strategy to find near-optimal solutions efficiently. Using a TWT simulator based on ns-3, we compare TASPER to several baselines, including HSA, a state-of-the-art solution originally designed for WirelessHART networks. We demonstrate that TASPER obtains up to 24.97% lower mean transmission rejection cost and saves up to 14.86% more energy compared to the leading baseline, ShortestFirst, in a challenging, large-scale scenario. Additionally, when compared to HSA, TASPER also reduces the energy consumption by 34% and reduces the mean rejection cost by 26%. Furthermore, we validate TASPER on our IIoT testbed, which comprises 10 commercial TWT-compatible stations, observing that our solution admits more transmissions than the best baseline strategy, without violating any AoI deadline.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the fair access problem and the Age of Information (AoI) under 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Mode 2 in vehicular networks. Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving assistance. Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwell time and communication duration. This results in unfair access to network resources, potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI. We apply a large language model (LLM)-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in balancing fair access and minimizing AoI.},

In response, existing research seeks to identify the unique fingerprints on the images they generate, which can be leveraged to attribute the generated images to their source models. However, existing methods are restricted to identifying models within a static set included in classifier training, incapable of adapting dynamically to newly emerging unseen models. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to develop a generalized model fingerprint extractor capable of zero-shot attribution that effectively attributes unseen models without exposure during training. Central to our method is a model synthesis technique, which generates numerous synthetic models that mimic the fingerprint patterns of real-world generative models. The design of the synthesis technique is motivated by observations on how the basic generative model's architecture building blocks and parameters influence fingerprint patterns, and it is validated through designed metrics to examine synthetic models' fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that the fingerprint extractor, trained solely on synthetic models, achieves impressive zero-shot generalization on a wide range of real-world generative models, improving model identification and verification accuracy on unseen models by over 40% and 15%, respectively, compared to existing approaches.},

Our design incorporates a commercial human knee joint model for accurate anatomical representation, materials that closely mimic human skin properties, an injury simulation mechanism for replicating MCL injuries, and pressure sensors to capture user-applied pressure during manipulation. We conducted threetwo evaluations: an internal test with our collaborating clinician to configure our manikin for four MCL injury conditions (i.e., healthy, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3) using a psychophysics method; a subsequent study where 6 certified clinicians rated each condition for consistency and a technical evaluation measuring abduction range in the healthy and grade 3 configurations. Results show that our manikin can reliably displaydistinguish between healthy and unhealthy MCLs, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 1.00 for healthy condition, and 1.00 and 0.83, respectively, for the unhealthy condition. However, further improvements are needed to accurately distinguish between injury gradesgrade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 injuries.

We validated the approach with a leave-one-session-out analysis repeated five times and made comparisons to a prosthesis-specific classifier. The dataset was created by merging data from two different prosthesis models (Vanderbilt University, VU, Gen 2 and Gen 3 powered knee-ankle prostheses), for a total of 31 sessions acquired across multiple days from 11 subjects. Subjects performed five locomotion tasks: level walking, incline and decline walking, and stair ascent and descent. Since transitions between different locomotion modes happen at different gait events, the analyses have been repeated for both heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. At HS events, the proposed approach achieves a median f1-score of 99.12% and 92.41% on VU Gen 2 and Gen 3 prostheses respectively. At TO events, the proposed approach reaches a median f1-score of 96.83% with VU Gen 2 and 94.36% with VU Gen 3.

In this study, we characterized changes in gait biomechanics between healthy young adults first exposure to ankle exoskeletons and after 7+ hours of training when they demonstrated full motor adaptation. We observed consistent markers of adaptation in ankle kinematics and spatial gait features; expert exoskeleton users exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion before a powerful and concentrated push-off while walking with narrower and longer steps. Adaptations in muscle coordination patterns were more varied, but generally involved reducing co-contraction throughout the leg. By the end of training, non-propulsive exoskeleton-assisted gait features approached those of unassisted walking. Our results suggest that effective exoskeleton use involves selectively avoiding most disruptions to typical gait while accommodating energetically beneficial changes around push-off. All reported gait features can be monitored and targeted in real-time, facilitating the application of these results to reduce the time burden for novice users to maximally benefit from ankle exoskeletons.},

To maximize the effectiveness of this technique, it is crucial to select the optimal stimulation amplitude during a rehabilitation session. However, current tuning methods are time-consuming and subjective, relying on trial-and-error, clinician observations, and participant feedback. To improve this process, there is a need to define quantitative relationships between stimulation amplitude and measurable biomechanical metrics. In this study, we present a case series that includes two participants with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury walking with tSCS programmed to provide different stimulation amplitudes. We measured spatiotemporal parameters, electromyography, and inverse kinematics during overground walking with tSCS. Our results indicate that gait speed, stride length, and electromyography outcomes (e.g., muscle coactivation) systematically change with stimulation amplitude. This research is valuable in advancing our understanding of how stimulation amplitude relates to walking biomechanics. In the future, this knowledge will be used to design real-time, adaptive tSCS tuning methods for use in rehabilitation.},

However, combining differentiable biomechanical modeling with Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) offers a promising approach to motion capture in clinical settings, requiring only minimal equipment, such as webcams, and minimal effort for data collection. This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 individuals with stroke performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r > 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE (root mean squared error) values ranging from 2∘-5∘ for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3∘ for joint angles, 0.01m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings. MMC could provide valuable insights into movement rehabilitation after stroke, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new dual-arm mobile medicine robot that operates nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for upper respiratory tract sampling. This robotic system was designed to replace the delicate and complex mucus sampling operations of medical personnel. To this end, we designed a new hardware system. We developed advanced 3D vision and force sensing hybrid perception algorithms for the robot to accurately locate the nostril position, manipulate the swab into the nostril and then carefully advance the swab along the inferior nasal tract to the designated sampling position in the posterior nasal cavity. The swab is rotated to sample the mucus, after which the swab is withdrawn to end the process. In addition, the whole sampling process is fully automatic and performed by a robot, including grabbing the swab, opening the culture tube, folding the swab in the culture tube after sampling and sealing it, disinfecting the robot, etc. This mobile robot body is also installed with a human-robot-interaction module with voice interaction, which is linked to the Internet and can scan the code to bind the sampler’s ID information to the culture tube. The experimental results of more than 8,000 volunteer experiments indicate that the proposed robot PCR sampling results are as accurate as those of humans. Questionnaires show that our robot NP swab sampling is more comfortable than manual sampling.},

  abstract     = {Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients, play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback, especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex relationship between palpation behavior and pain sound. The high-dimensional nature of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in response to palpation force, by co-optimizing realtime human feedback using machine learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated that the system adapts to an individual’s palpation forces and sound preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensities, from mild discomfort to acute distress. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits saturation at lower forces with gender-specific thresholds. Thus, this study presents an early attempt to use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning to co-optimize haptic input and auditory pain expression. These findings highlight the system’s potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by offering a controllable and immersive simulation platforms.},

The algorithm accepts a pair of ambient and flash images as inputs, and a flash-only image, which corresponds to the one captured with flash as the sole illumination source, is derived from the inputs. In light of the reflection-free nature of the flash-only image, we use it to guide the diffusion model to reconstruct the structures of the transmission image. A feature distillation scheme is designed to infer the chromatic attributes of the transmission image from the ambient image, and the features are used to modulate the generative priors learned by the diffusion model. We use time-aware strategies to ensure the synchronization between feature distillation and the dynamic image generation process of the diffusion model. The performance of the proposed algorithm is sequentially optimized in latent and pixel spaces. We also develop a plug-and-play fidelity-enhancing module (FEM) and integrate it into the proposed model to enable the faithful reconstruction of fine-granular visual characteristics of the target scene and reduce artifacts. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows superior quantitative and qualitative performance over state-of-the-art methods in real-world scenarios. By leveraging the optical cue and the generative capability of the diffusion model, the algorithm can accurately restore the visual details of the transmission image even in the presence of strong reflections, and it also exhibits satisfactory robustness against nonlinear image representation and misalignment.},

To address these issues, this article studies a self-clustering particle swarm optimization algorithm with modal detection informed classification evaluation (MDICE) to solve ECMMOPs. To deal with multimodality, a surrogate-assisted self-clustering update mechanism is first designed to update individuals in each modality. Following that, a novel modal detection strategy is proposed based on the awareness of fitness landscapes to identify all potential modal seeds. For better utilization of FEs, a modality-guided classification evaluation strategy is designed to efficiently generate infilling samples for each constraint and modality. Moreover, to address the complex constraints, a surrogate-assisted feasibility search strategy is developed to quickly search for feasible solutions at a lower evaluation cost. Experimental results on 33 benchmark functions with various characteristics indicate that MDICE outperforms four state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms.},

This type of NN is formed based on cells that perform sequential and stale calculations via gates and states without knowing whether their order, within the cell, is optimal. In this article, we propose a revised and real-time adjusted LSTM cell that selects the best gate or state as its final output. Our cell is running under a shallow topology, has a minimal look-back period, and is trained online.

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its capability to design neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies (i.e., computationally reduced search configurations). To solve the search stability and searched architecture's generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (referred as $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided, and comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and make the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the proxy robustness problem, we first benchmark differentiable NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers, and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxy settings. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $\beta$-DARTS (termed as Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS. In summary, our search scheme shows lots of outstanding properties for practical applications,},

To prevent such fraud at its source, proactive defense methods have been proposed that embed invisible adversarial perturbations into images, disrupting the manipulation process and rendering the forged output unconvincing to observers. However, non-targeted disruption of the output may leave identifiable facial features intact, potentially leading to the stigmatization of individuals. In this work, we propose a universal framework for combating facial manipulation, termed ID-Guard. The framework employs a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to generate cross-model transferable adversarial perturbations. We introduce a novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) to suppress identifiable features in manipulated faces. The perturbation generation is optimized by formulating the disruption of various manipulation types as a multi-task learning problem, with a dynamic weighting strategy designed to enhance cross-model performance. Experimental results show that ID-Guard effectively defends against diverse facial manipulation models while degrading identifiable regions in manipulated images. It also enables disrupted images to evade facial inpainting and facial recognition systems. Moreover, ID-Guard can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component into other tasks, such as adversarial training.},

Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back propagation. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Disentangled Transfer Learning (DTL), which disentangles the trainable parameters from the backbone using a lightweight Compact Side Network (CSN). By progressively extracting task-specific information with a few low-rank linear mappings and appropriately adding the information back to the backbone, CSN effectively realizes knowledge transfer in various downstream recognition tasks. We further extend DTL to more difficult tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation by employing a more sparse architectural design. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DTL, which not only reduces a large amount of GPU memory usage and trainable parameters, but also outperforms existing PETL methods by a significant margin in accuracy.},

However, in real-world scenarios, the unobserved elements are often not arbitrarily located, and may concentrate within entire rows or columns. We refer to this missing mechanism as structural missingness, and traditional MC and TC schemes suffer from drastic degradation under these circumstances. This work addresses the challenge of restoring structural missingness by introducing a novel framework for simultaneously reconstructing multiple matrices, called multi-matrix completion (MMC). In MMC, tri-factorization across matrices captures the correlation between matrices, and Tikhonov regularization on each matrix exploits its correlation. This design enables MMC to efficiently handle both random and structural missingness. In addition, MMC is not affected by the smoothness along matrices which makes it suitable for a wider variety of data compared to Fourier transform based TC methods. The alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to solve the resultant optimization problem. The global convergence of the algorithm is supported by comprehensive theoretical analyses. We demonstrate the versatility of MMC through extensive experiments in image and video restoration, and showcase its superior performance in comparison to traditional MC and TC methods.

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.},

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments on 11 large-scale multi-sensor datasets highlight our superior performance, demonstrating adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity 3D surface is essential for vision tasks across various domains such as medical imaging, cultural heritage preservation, quality inspection, virtual reality, and autonomous navigation. However, the intricate nature of 3D data representations poses significant challenges in restoring diverse 3D surfaces while capturing fine-grained geometric details at a low cost. This paper introduces an efficient multimodal normal-based 3D surface super-resolution (mn3DSSR) framework, designed to address the challenges of microgeometry enhancement and computational overhead. Specifically, we have constructed one of the largest normalbased multimodal dataset, ensuring superior data quality and diversity through meticulous subjective selection. Furthermore, we explore a new two-branch multimodal alignment approach along with a multimodal split fusion module to mitigate computational complexity while improving restoration performances. To address the limitations associated with normal-based multimodal learning, we develop novel normal-induced loss functions that facilitate geometric consistency and improve feature alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets across four different 3D data representations demonstrate that mn3DSSR consistently outperforms state-ofthe-art super-resolution methods in terms of restoration accuracy with high computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Continual learning (CL) tackles a fundamental challenge in machine learning, aiming to continuously learn novel data from non-stationary data streams while mitigating forgetting of previously learned data. Although existing CL algorithms have introduced various practical techniques for combating forgetting, little attention has been devoted to studying how data schedules – which dictate how the sample distribution of a data stream evolves over time – affect the CL problem. Empirically, most CL methods are susceptible to schedule changes: they exhibit markedly lower accuracy when dealing with more “difficult schedules over the same underlying training data. In practical scenarios, data schedules are often unknown and a key challenge is thus to design CL methods that are robust to diverse schedules to ensure model reliability. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of schedule robustness for CL and propose Schedule-Robust Continual Learning (SCROLL), a strong baseline satisfying this desirable property. SCROLL trains a linear classifier on a suitably pre-trained representation, followed by model adaptation using replay data only. We connect SCROLL to a meta-learning formulation of CL with provable guarantees on schedule robustness. Empirically, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing CL methods and we provide extensive ablations to highlight its properties.},

Our framework exhibits several desirable characteristics, including the ability to express dynamics on evolving graphs without piecewise integration, the capability to calibrate trajectories with subsequent data, and robustness to missing observations.

  abstract     = {Event cameras offer significant advantages for low-light video enhancement, primarily due to their high dynamic range. Current research, however, is severely limited by the absence of large-scale, real-world, and spatio-temporally aligned event-video datasets. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 30,000 pairs of frames and events captured under varying illumination. This dataset was curated using a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory, achieving spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm and temporal alignment with errors under 0.01s for 90% of the dataset. Based on the dataset, we propose EvLight++, a novel event-guided low-light video enhancement approach designed for robust performance in real-world scenarios. Firstly, we design a multi-scale holistic fusion branch to integrate structural and textural information from both images and events. To counteract variations in regional illumination and noise, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection, enhancing features from high SNR regions and augmenting those from low SNR regions by extracting structural information from events. To incorporate temporal information and ensure temporal coherence, we further introduce a recurrent module and temporal loss in the whole pipeline. Extensive experiments on ours and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate that EvLight++ significantly outperforms both single image- and video-based methods by 1.37 dB and 3.71 dB, respectively. To further explore its potential in downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, we extend our datasets by adding pseudo segmentation and depth labels via meticulous annotation efforts with foundation models. Experiments under diverse low-light scenes show that the enhanced results achieve a 15.97% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation.},

Recent advancements have aimed to accelerate SpMM by harnessing the powerful Tensor Cores found in modern GPUs. However, despite these efforts, existing methods frequently encounter performance degradation when ported across different Tensor Core architectures. Recognizing that scalable SpMM across multiple generations of Tensor Cores relies on the effective use of general-purpose instructions, we have meticulously developed a SpMM library named SSpMM. However, a significant conflict exists between granularity and performance in current Tensor Core instructions. To resolve this, we introduce the innovative Transpose Mapping Scheme, which elegantly implements fine-grained kernels using coarse-grained instructions. Additionally, we propose the Register Shuffle Method to further enhance performance. Finally, we introduce Sparse Vector Compression, a technique that ensures our kernels are scalable with both structured and unstructured sparsity. Our experimental results, conducted on four generations of Tensor Core GPUs using over 3,000 sparse matrices from well established matrix collections, demonstrate that SSpMM achieves an average speedup of 2.04×, 2.81×, 2.07×, and 1.87×, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SpMM solution. Furthermore, we have integrated SSpMM into PyTorch, achieving a 1.81× speedup in end-to-end Transformer inference compared to cuDNN.},

By abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace (A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6% higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii) long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable approach to complex robotic manipulation.},

We present an anytime approach employing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method in continuous domains in terms of states, actions and observations and general-belief dependent reward and payoff operators. Unlike previous approaches, our method ensures safety anytime with respect to the currently expanded search tree without relying on the convergence of the search. We prove convergence in probability with an exponential rate of a version of our algorithms and study proposed techniques via extensive simulations. Even with a tiny number of tree queries, the best action found by our approach is much safer than the baseline. Moreover, our approach constantly yields better than the baseline action in terms of objective function. This is because we revise the values and statistics maintained in the search tree and remove from them the contribution of the pruned actions. We rigorously show that our cleaning routine is necessary. Without it, at the limit of convergence of MCTS, an infinite amount of sampled dangerous actions can be detrimental to the objective function.},

However, it is still challenging for existing visual SLAM approaches to achieve good performance in low-texture or illumination-changing scenes. In recent years, some researchers have turned to edge-based SLAM approaches to deal with the challenging scenes, which are more robust than feature-based and direct SLAM methods. Nevertheless, existing edge-based methods are computationally expensive and inferior than other visual SLAM systems in terms of accuracy. In this study, we propose EdgeSLAM, a novel RGB-D edge-based SLAM approach to deal with challenging scenarios that is efficient, accurate, and robust. EdgeSLAM is built on two innovative modules: efficient edge selection and adaptive robust motion estimation. The edge selection module can efficiently select a small set of edge pixels, which significantly improves the computational efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. The motion estimation module improves the system's accuracy and robustness by adaptively handling outliers in motion estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted on TUM RGBD, ICL-NUIM and ETH3D datasets, and experimental results show that EdgeSLAM significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, which achieves 29.17% accuracy improvements with a high processing speed of up to 120 FPS and a high positioning success rate of 97.06%.},

The first key contribution is an analytical extension of the classical angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model from static to swaying grounds whose motion period may be different than the robot's gait period. This extension results in a time-varying, nonhomogeneous robot model, which is fundamentally different from the existing pendulum models. We synthesize a discrete footstep control law for the model and derive a new set of sufficient stability conditions that verify the controller's stabilizing effect. Finally, experiments conducted on a Digit humanoid robot, both in simulations and on hardware, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in addressing bipedal locomotion on swaying ground, even under uncertain surface motions and unknown external pushes.},

HT has advantages in cost, complexity, and patient acceptance for telemedicine in low-resource communities or remote locations. However, the stability, transparency, and performance of bilateral HT are unexplored. In this paper, we therefore develop a mathematical model of the HT system using test data. We then analyze various control architectures with this model and implement them with the HT system, testing volunteer operators and a virtual fixture-based simulated patient to find the achievable performance, investigate stability, and determine the most promising teleoperation scheme in the presence of time delays. We show that instability in HT, while not destructive or dangerous, makes the system impossible to use.

For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format, enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands through a force-position hybrid mapping. Comparative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses other methods in grasp success rate, finger coordination, contact force management, and both grasp and computational efficiency, achieving results most akin to human grasping. The robustness of our approach is also validated through multiple randomized experimental setups, and its generalization capability is tested across diverse objects and robotic hands.

By utilizing geographic information from satellite orthoimagery, GeoVINS tackles scale ambiguity and accumulative drift problems inherent in standard visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) systems, and provides accurate, robust, and real-time global localization. In particular, to address the challenge of memory explosion issue for large-scale localization, we propose a novel aerial ‘classify-then-retrieve’ aerial VPR approach, where geographic locations can be efficiently identified and memory usage can be reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to classical retrieval-based approaches. In addition, a hierarchical geographic data association scheme, enhanced by state-of-the-art deep learning-based feature matching, guarantees high efficiency and robustness against variations in appearance and viewpoint. Relying on the obtained three-dimensional (3D) geographic information, GeoVINS achieves efficient global state initialization and precise motion tracking. To address GPU limitations in embedded devices, a collaborative CPU-GPU utilization approach is proposed, seamlessly integrating asynchronous global information to eliminate accumulative errors. Relying solely on satellite imagery and without requiring any other prior information, GeoVINS achieves rapid place recognition in unseen environments of city-scale (e.g., 2500${\mathrm{km}}^{2}$) on an embedded computing device with an inference time of 43 ms, and performs state estimation at a frequency of 25 Hz. The system enables autonomous UAV navigation as an alternative to GNSS.},

  abstract     = {VINGS-Mono is a monocular (inertial) Gaussian Splatting (GS) SLAM framework designed for large scenes. The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.},

Many traditional methods generate robot-centric actions, which differ from intuitive human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.},

A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed- integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics.

In addition, broken ice fields are becoming the dominant ice conditions encountered in the Arctic, where the effects of collisions with ice are highly dependent on where contact occurs and on the particular features of the ice floes. In this paper, we present AUTO-IceNav, a framework for the autonomous navigation of ships operating in ice floe fields. Trajectories are computed in a receding-horizon manner, where we frequently replan given updated ice field data. During a planning step, we assume a nominal speed that is safe with respect to the current ice conditions, and compute a reference path. We formulate a novel cost function that minimizes the kinetic energy loss of the ship from ship-ice collisions and incorporate this cost as part of our lattice-based path planner. The solution computed by the lattice planning stage is then used as an initial guess in our proposed optimization-based improvement step, producing a locally optimal path. Extensive experiments were conducted both in simulation and in a physical testbed to validate our approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with large-scale decentralised task allocation problems for multiple heterogeneous robots. One of the grand challenges with decentralised task allocation problems is the NP-hardness for computation and communication. This paper proposes a decentralised Decreasing Threshold Task Allocation (DTTA) algorithm that enables parallel allocation by leveraging a decreasing threshold to handle the NP-hardness. DTTA can release both computation and communication burdens for multiple robots in a decentralised network. Additionally, DTTA provides a theoretical guarantee of the quality of the solution for maximising submodular utility functions. Theoretical analysis indicates that DTTA can provide an optimality guarantee of $(1-\epsilon)/2$ with computation complexity of $O(\min (r^{2}, \frac{r}{\epsilon }\ln \frac{r}{\epsilon }))$ for each robot, where $\epsilon$ is the parameter controlling the decreasing speed of the threshold, $r$ is the number of tasks. To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations based on a multi-target surveillance scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that DTTA delivers comparable solution quality significantly faster than state-of-the-art task allocation algorithms. Its advantages are particularly pronounced in large-scale missions with thousands of tasks and robots.},

The presence of such transitions results in all subnet systems being divided into two types: dangerous subnet systems and nondangerous subnet systems. Second, based on the number of nondangerous subnets consistently operated, the more general definitions of strongly robust, weakly robust, and nonrobust markings are established. Third, generalized reduced reachability graphs (R2Gs) are constructed to provide a formal tool for robustness analysis. An algorithm is formulated to compute the maximum nondangerous elementary circuits (NDE circuits) for each marking in generalized R2G. Subsequently, by analyzing the transitions involved in the maximum NDE circuits, we derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the robustness of markings.

  abstract     = {The increasing structural and operational interdependencies between power distribution networks (PDNs) and district heating networks (DHNs) have intensified the need for integrated and resilient contingency management strategies. This necessitates the development of advanced analytical frameworks for probabilistic N-1 and N-k security assessments that capture the temporal and spatial coupling of these networks throughout all phases of resilient operations. Owing to this necessity, this article proposes a novel contingency multicriteria assessment framework to quantify the interdependencies between the resilience of PDNs and DHNs, incorporating various phases of contingency chains. The methodology utilizes the simultaneous evaluation of criteria and alternatives (SECA) approach to systematically rank critical contingencies, thereby revealing the most severe potential cascading failures that threaten energy security. The following stage entails the presentation of a pioneering spatiotemporal cascading failure analytical model, which is developed to coordinate the withstand-and-recover phases across interdependent PDNs and DHNs. This model is supported by tailored operational resilience key performance indicators (KPIs) that trace power-induced heating service degradation across diverse backup configurations, including line-pack storage, energy storage systems (ESSs), and integrated demand–response programs (DRPs). As another unattainable novelty, the developed decision-making framework integrates static and dynamic resilience analyses to provide an all-encompassing comprehension of the integrated PDNs and DHNs’ resilience. The proposed framework is validated through co-simulation of a modified IEEE 33-bus PDN and a 32-node DHN, employing analytical and empirical methodologies. The results indicate that the strategic implementation of backup flexibility resources, when synchronized with DHN service provision, can enhance DHN service continuity by up to 29%, while concurrently reducing the full recovery time by nearly 41%. Dynamic resilience analyses are further conducted in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to evaluate the real-time transient response under top-ranked contingency scenarios.},

With the help of the Lyapunov–Razumikhin technique, an ISS-type comparison principle is proposed. The designed self-triggering mechanism (STM) can predict the next impulse instant only using the current state information, different from the existing event-triggered results that need a continuous state monitor. Based on such an STM, some impulsive controller design schemes for ISS of T-S fuzzy delay systems are provided. In addition, non-Zeno behavior can be guaranteed automatically without extra limitations. Finally, two simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the issue of fault-tolerant optimal pursuit strategies in a nonlinear pursuit-evasion (PE) game involving multiple pursuers and a single evader. The main challenge lies in ensuring the successful capture of the evader despite the presence of actuator partial loss of effectiveness and bias faults within the pursuers group. To overcome this challenge, a two-layer control architecture is proposed. At the control layer, an integral sliding-mode controller is developed to mitigate the impact of bias faults, and an adaptive estimation mechanism is incorporated to identify the fault parameters. At the decision-making layer, performance index functions for both the pursuers and the evader are formulated based on the PE state error and their respective control strategies, and optimal pursuit and evasion strategies are derived by solving the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Furthermore, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed, with each participant using a critic network to approximate the optimal strategies for the pursuers and the evader. The proposed control mechanism is theoretically proven to ensure that all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, allowing the faulty pursuers to successfully capture the evader. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is validated through two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising technique for high-quality 3D rendering, leading to increasing interest in integrating 3DGS into realism SLAM systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as Gaussian primitives redundancy, forgetting problem during continuous optimization, and difficulty in initializing primitives in monocular case due to lack of depth information. In order to achieve efficient and photorealistic mapping, we propose RP-SLAM, a 3D Gaussian splatting-based vision SLAM method for monocular and RGB-D cameras. RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency. Finally, for the monocular case, a monocular keyframe initialization method based on sparse point cloud is proposed to improve the initialization accuracy of Gaussian primitives, which provides a geometric basis for subsequent optimization. The results of numerous experiments demonstrate that RP-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art map rendering accuracy while ensuring real-time performance and model compactness.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable speed and performance in novel view synthesis but suffers from overfitting and degraded reconstruction when handling sparse-view inputs. This paper innovatively addresses this challenge from a learning-to-optimize perspective by leveraging a learned optimizer (i.e., a multi-layer perceptron, MLP) to update the relevant parameters of 3DGS during the optimization process. Evidently, using a single MLP to handle all optimization variables, whose numbers may even vary during the optimization process, is impossible. Therefore, we present a point-wise position-aware optimizer that updates the parameters for each 3DGS point individually. Specifically, it takes the point coordinates and corresponding parameter values as input to predict the updates, thereby allowing efficient and adaptive optimization. In the case of sparse view modeling, the learned optimizer imposes position-aware constraints on the parameter updates during optimization. This effectively encourages the relevant parameters to converge stably to better solutions. To update the optimizer's parameters, we propose a dynamic gradient update strategy based on spatial perturbation and weighted fusion, enabling the optimizer to capture broader contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the problem of modeling 3DGS from sparse training views, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.},

In mixed reality (MR), where users see the real world and their own hands, haptic redirection enables a physical interaction with virtual objects but poses greater challenges due to altering real-world perception. This paper investigates the effect of the realism of the user's surroundings and of the user's hand on haptic redirection. The user's familiarity with their actual physical surroundings and their actual hand could make the redirection manipulations easier–or harder–to detect. In a user study (N = 30) participants saw either a virtual environment or their actual physical surroundings, and saw their hand rendered either with a generic 3D model or with a live 2D video sprite of their actual hand. The study used a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) design asking participants to detect hand redirections that bridged physical to virtual offsets of varying magnitudes. The results show that participants were not more sensitive to 2D video sprite hand redirection than to VR hand redirection, which supports the use of haptic redirection in MR.},

While prior work has focused on preventing misalignment, less is known about how teams recover when alignment fails. We examine collaboration under scale asymmetry, a particularly disruptive form of perceptual divergence. In a study with 36 VR teams, we identify behavioral patterns that distinguish adaptive recovery from persistent breakdown. Successful teams flexibly shifted between user-driven and system-supported cues, while others repeated ineffective strategies. Based on these findings, we introduce the Perceptual Asymmetry Coordination Theory (PACT), a dual-pathway model that describes coordination as an evolving process shaped by cue integration and strategic responsiveness. PACT reframes recovery not as a return to alignment, but as a dynamic adaptation to misalignment. These insights inform the design of VR systems that support recovery through multi-channel, adaptive coordination in scale-divergent environments.},

Specifically, we investigate how 1) idle behavior, 2) AI-generated gestures, and 3) motion-captured movements from a confederate (a controlled partner in the study) influence the quality of conversation and how that partner is perceived. We examined these effects in both symmetric interactions (where both participants use VR headsets and controllers) and asymmetric interactions (where one participant uses a desktop setup). We developed a social XR platform that supports asymmetric device configurations to provide varying levels of immersion. The platform also supports a modular avatar animation system providing idle behavior, real-time AI-generated co-speech gestures, and full-body motion capture. Using a 2×3 mixed design with 39 participants, we measured users' sense of spatial presence, their perception of the confederate, and the overall conversation quality. Our results show that users who were more immersed felt a stronger sense of presence and viewed their partner as more human-like and believable. Surprisingly, however, the type of avatar animation did not significantly affect conversation quality or how the partner was perceived. Participants often reported focusing more on what was said rather than how the avatar moved.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a fundamental role in extended reality (XR) applications. As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

However, the labeled resource are not always accessible due to the privacy disputes, limited computational capacity and other thorny restrictions. Therefore, we propose source-free model adaptation task for unsupervised 3D object management, which utilizes a pre-trained model to boost the performance with no access to source data and labels. Specifically, we compute representative prototypes to assume the source feature distribution, and design a bidirectional cumulative confidence-based adaptation strategy to adaptively align unlabeled samples towards prototypes. Subsequently, a dual-model distillation mechanism is proposed to generate source hypothesis for remedying the absence of ground-truth labels.

A different way of thinking about edge bundling is to simultaneously optimize both the drawing and the bundling, which we investigate in this paper. We build on an earlier work where we introduced a novel algorithmic framework for bundling-aware graph drawing consisting of three main steps, namely Filter for a skeleton subgraph, Draw the skeleton, and Bundle the remaining edges against the drawing of the skeleton. We propose several alternative implementations and experimentally compare them against each other and the simple idea of first drawing the full graph and subsequently applying edge bundling to it.

However, complications from perceptual challenges in Virtual Reality (VR), combined with the ergonomic and cognitive challenges of sketching in all three dimensions in mid-air lower the accuracy and aesthetic quality of 3D sketches. This paper explores how color-to-depth and opacity cues support users to create and perceive freehand, 3D strokes in room-scale sketching, unlocking a full 360°of freedom for creation. We implemented three graphic depth shader cues modifying the (1) alpha, (2) hue, and (3) value levels of a single color to dynamically adjust the color and transparency of meshes relative to their depth from the user. We investigated how these depth cues influence sketch efficiency, sketch quality, and total sketch experience with 24 participants in a comparative, counterbalanced, 4 × 1 within-subjects user study. First, with our graphic depth shader cues we could successfully transfer results of prior research in seated sketching tasks to room-scale scenarios. Our color-to-depth cues improved the similarity of sketches to target models. This highlights the usefulness of the color-to-depth approach even for the increased range of motion and depth in room-scale sketching. Second, our shaders assisted participants to complete tasks faster, spend a greater percentage of task time sketching, reduced the feeling of mental tiredness and improved the feeling of sketch efficiency in room-scale sketching. We discuss these findings and share our insights and conclusions to advance the research on improving spatial cognition in immersive sketching systems.},

  abstract     = {Swarm fragmentation, the breakdown of communication and coordination among robots, can critically compromise a swarm's mission. Integrating Augmented Reality support into swarm monitoring—especially through co-located visualisations anchored directly on the robots— may enable human operators to detect early signs of fragmentation and intervene effectively. In this work, we propose three localised visual cues—targeting robot connectivity, dominant decision influences, and movement direction—to make explicit the underlying Perception-Decision-Action (PDA) loop of each robot. Through an immersive Virtual Reality user study, 51 participants were tasked with both anticipating potential fragmentation and selecting the appropriate control to prevent it, while observing swarms exhibiting expansion, densification, flocking, and swarming behaviours. Our results reveal that a visualisation emphasising inter-robot connectivity significantly improves anticipation of fragmentation, though none of the cues consistently enhance control selection over a baseline condition. These findings underscore the potential of co-located AR-enhanced visual feedback to support human-swarm interaction and inform the design of future AR-based supervisory systems for robot swarms.

  abstract     = {With the advent of consumer-targeted, low-cost virtual reality devices and facile authoring technologies, the development and design of experiences in virtual reality are also becoming more accessible to non-expert authors. However, the inherent freedom of exploration in these virtual spaces presents a significant challenge for designers seeking to guide user attention toward points and objects of interest. This paper proposes the new technique WarpVision, which utilizes spatial curvature to subtly guide the user's attention in virtual reality. WarpVision distorts an area around the point of interest, thus changing the size, form, and location of all objects and the space around them. In this way, the user's attention can be guided even when the point of interest is not in the immediate field of vision. WarpVision is evaluated in a user study based on a within-subjects design, comparing it to the state-of-the-art technique Deadeye. Participants completed visual search tasks across two virtual environments being supported with WarpVision at four different intensities. Results show that WarpVision significantly reduces search times compared to Deadeye. While both techniques introduce comparable levels of immersion disruption, WarpVision has a lower reported impact on the user's well-being.},

Since real-world studies of this kind would pose ethical and safety risks, we employed virtual reality (VR) to simulate an accident scenario. In the scenario, the driver approaches a fork in the road, knowing that one path would lead off a cliff crashing the car fatally—as the fork comes closer, the other, safe, path is suddenly blocked by trees, forcing the driver to make a split-second decision where to go. A total of $N = 71$ drivers completed the task, and we asked another $N = 30$ observers to watch short video clips leading up to the final event and to predict which way the driver would take. We then compared both prediction accuracy as well as attention patterns—how focus is distributed across objects—with AI systems, including vision language models (VLMs) and vision-only models. We found that overall, prediction performance increased as the accident time point approached; interestingly, humans fared better than AI systems overall except for the final time period just before the event. We also found that humans adapted their attention dynamically, shifting focus to important scene elements before an event, whereas AI attention remained static, overlooking key details of the scene. Importantly, as the accident time point approached, human-AI attentional alignment decreased, even though both types of models improved in prediction accuracy. Despite distinct temporal trajectories—vision-only models declining from an early advantage and VLMs peaking in the middle—both models achieved low to zero alignment with human attention. These findings highlight a critical dissociation: AI models make accurate predictions, but rely on visual strategies diverging from human processing, underscoring a gap between explainability and task performance.},

  abstract     = {In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), accurate size perception is critical, especially in training simulations designed to mimic real-world tasks, such as, nuclear power plant control room or medical procedures. These simulations have dials or instruments of varying sizes. Visual information of the objects alone, often fails to capture subtle size differences in virtual reality (VR). However, integrating haptic and hand-avatars may potentially improve accuracy and performance. This improvement could be especially beneficial for real-world scenarios where hand(s) are intermittently visible or obscured. To investigate how this intermittent presence or absence of body-scaled hand-avatars affects size perception when integrated with haptic information, we conducted 2×2 mixed-factorial experiment design using a near-field, size-estimation task in VR. The experiment conditions compared size estimations with or without virtual hand visibility in the perception and reporting phases. The task involved 16 graspable objects of varying sizes and randomly repeated 3 times across 48 trials per participant (total 80 participants). We employed Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) analysis to objective measures: perceived size, residual error and proportional errors. Results revealed that as the tangible-graspable size increases, overestimation reduces if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Also, overestimation reduces as the number of trials increases, if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Thus, the presence of hand-avatars facilitated perceptual calibration. This novel study, with different combinations of hand-avatar visibility, taking perception and reporting of size as two separate phases, could open future research directions in more complex scenarios for refined integration of sensory modalities and consequently enhance real-world application performance.},

  abstract     = {Handheld haptic devices often face challenges in delivering stiffness feedback with both high force output and good backdrivability, especially under practical constraints on power consumption, size, and weight. These difficulties stem from the inherent performance limitations of conventional actuation mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, low-power handheld device that provides wide-range stiffness feedback through a novel dual actuation design composed of two key components. A programmable spring (PS), implemented via an adjustable lever arm, enables tunable physical stiffness. Two electrostatic clutches (ECs) are integrated to compensate for the inherent limitations of PS-based interactions in stiffness display range, rendered object size, and free motion capability. The feedback force arises passively from the reaction of the PS and ECs to user input, effectively lowering both power consumption and actuator torque demands. A fully integrated prototype was developed, incorporating wireless communication, control, and power modules. The results of the evaluation experiments and user studies demonstrate that the device effectively renders stiffness across the full range, from free motion to full rigidity, and delivers more realistic elastic feedback compared to conventional electric motor-based systems.},

  abstract     = {Zoning out, a form of cognitive disengagement, seriously challenges the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) based upper limb rehabilitation. As therapy often involves repetitive tasks requiring sustained attention, undetected lapses in focus can reduce motor learning, engagement, and overall recovery outcomes. This research addresses this gap by proposing ZonAware, a novel strategy integrating real-time zoning out detection with adaptive intervention to enhance user engagement during VR rehabilitation. ZonAware identifies zoning out using five eye-tracking metrics: blink frequency, blink duration, pupil size, eye openness, and gaze duration. These signals are analysed through lightweight statistical models (Z-Score, Boxplot, and Modified Z-Score), with a hard voting mechanism producing binary classifications in real-time. Upon detection, a pattern changing intervention subtly modulates task difficulty by temporarily increasing, then decreasing it, to regain user focus without breaking immersion. Three user studies involving 70 healthy participants and 22 patients demonstrated the strategy's effectiveness. ZonAware achieved 98.24% detection accuracy with low latency (82–150 ms), reducing zoning out frequency by 53.57% and shortening disengagement duration from 18.1 to 4.8 seconds. The approach also improved user engagement, performance, and emotional motivation. ZonAware delivers one of the first real-time zoning out solutions for VR rehabilitation, offering an interpretable, theory-driven approach that enhances attention, engagement, and adaptability in human-computer interaction.},

Haptic Illusions (HIs), which leverage multisensory integration, have proven effective in expanding haptic experiences in single-user contexts. However, their role in XR collaboration has not been explored. To examine the applicability of HIs in multi-user scenarios, we conducted an experimental user study (N=30) investigating their effect on a collaborative object handover task in virtual reality. We manipulated visual shape and size individually and analyzed their impact on users' performance, experience, and behavior. Results show that while participants adapted to the illusions by shifting sensory reliance and employing specific sensorimotor strategies, visuo-haptic mismatches reduced both performance and experience. Moreover, mismatched visualizations in asymmetric user roles negatively impacted performance. Drawing from these findings, we provide practical guidelines for incorporating HIs into collaborative XR, marking a first step toward richer haptic interactions in shared virtual spaces.},

To this end, we developed a prototype and evaluated different pointing techniques for selecting 12 physical targets behind an LTTS, with distances ranging from 6 to 401 cm. We conducted a user study with 16 participants and measured user preferences, performance, and behavior. We analyzed the change in accuracy depending on the target position and the selection technique used. Our fndings include: (a) Users naturally align the touch point with their line of sight for targets farther than 36 cm behind the LTTS.

However, unlike instance-segmentation-driven setups, generating semantic scene graphs still suffer from limited accuracy due to coarse and noisy point cloud data typically acquired in practice, and from the lack of interactive strategies to incorporate users, spatialized and intuitive guidance. We identify three key challenges: designing controllable interaction forms, involving guidance in inference, and generalizing from local corrections. To address these, we propose SGSG, a Stroke-Guided Scene Graph generation method that enables users to interactively refine 3D semantic relationships and improve predictions in real time. We propose three types of strokes and a lightweight SGstrokes dataset tailored for this modality. Our model integrates stroke guidance representation and injection for spatio-temporal feature learning and reasoning correction, along with intervention losses that combine consistency-repulsive and geometry-sensitive constraints to enhance accuracy and generalization. Experiments and the user study show that SGSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods 3DSSG and SGFN in overall accuracy and precision, surpasses JointSSG in predicate-level metrics, and reduces task load across all control conditions, establishing SGSG as a new benchmark for interactive 3D scene graph generation and semantic understanding in XR.

Results show that participants experienced a compelling depth perception even from off-center angles of 23°–37°, and largely increasing virtual depth worsens depth perception and presence factors, highlighting the importance of balancing extended depth of virtual space and viewing distance from the wall-sized display.

Displaying AR guidance using a body-fixed coordinate system has the potential to further leverage this integration by enabling users to control when the guidance appears in their FOV.

Therefore, we explored the effects of three AR guidance positions (top, middle, and bottom) within a body-fixed coordinate system on pedestrian navigation in a virtual environment. Our results showed that AR guidance position significantly influenced eye movements, walking behaviors, and subjective evaluations. The top position resulted in the shortest duration of fixations on the guidance compared to the middle and bottom positions, and lower mental demand than the bottom position. The middle position had the smallest rate of vertical eye movement during gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment, and the smallest relative difference in walking speed between fixations on the guidance and the environment compared to the top and bottom positions. The bottom position led to the shortest duration and smallest amplitude of gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment compared to the top and middle positions, and lower frustration than the top position. Based on these findings, we offer design implications for AR guidance positioning within a body-fixed coordinate system during pedestrian navigation.},

  abstract     = {As virtual reality (VR) continues to expand, particularly in social VR platforms and immersive gaming environments, understanding the factors that shape user experience is becoming increasingly important. Avatars and locomotion methods play central roles in influencing how users identify with their virtual representations and navigate virtual spaces. Despite extensive research on these elements individually, their relationship remains underexplored. In particular, little is known about how congruence between avatar appearance and locomotion method affects user perceptions. This study investigates the impact of avatar-locomotion congruence on user experience and avatar identification in VR. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, employing two visually distinct avatar types (human and gorilla) and two locomotion methods (human-like arm-swinging and gorilla-like arm-rolling), to assess their individual and combined effects. Our results indicate that congruence between avatar appearance and locomotion method enhances both avatar identification and user experience. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between avatars and locomotion in VR, with potential applications in enhancing user experience in immersive gaming, social VR, and gamified remote physical therapy},

  abstract     = {Stigma towards individuals with schizophrenia reduces quality of life, creating a barrier to accessing education and employment opportunities. Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized mental health conditions, and stigma is prevalent particularly among healthcare professionals. In this study, we investigated whether Virtual Reality (VR) can be incorporated into interventions to reduce stigma. In particular, we compared the effectiveness of three VR conditions based on intergroup contact theory in reducing stigma in form of implicit and explicit attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Through an immersive virtual consultation in a clinical setting, participants (N = 60) experienced one of three different conditions: the Doctor's perspective (embodiment in a majority group member during contact), the Patient's perspective (embodiment in a minority group member) and a Third-person perspective (vicarious contact). Results demonstrated an increase of stigma on certain explicit measures (perceived recovery and social restriction) but also an increase of empathy (perspective-taking, empathic concern) across all conditions regardless of perspective. More importantly, participants' viewpoint influenced the desire for social distance differently depending on the perspective: the Third-person observation significantly increased the desire for social distance, Doctor embodiment marginally decreased it, while Patient embodiment showed no significant change. No change was found in the Implicit Association Test. These findings suggest that VR intergroup contact can effectively reduce certain dimensions of stigma toward schizophrenia, but the type of perspective experienced significantly impacts outcomes.},

However, the validity of using XR prototyping for user studies for contact-intensive robotic tasks remains underexplored. These in-contact tasks are particularly relevant due to challenges arising from indirect force perception in robot control. Therefore, in this work, we investigate a representative example of such a task: robotic ultrasound. A user study was conducted to assess the transferability of results from a simulated user study to real-world conditions, comparing two force-assistance approaches. The XR simulation replicates the physical study set-up employing a virtual robotic arm, its control interface, ultrasound imaging, and two force-assistance methods: automation and force visualization. Our results indicate that while differences in force deviation, perceived workload, and trust emerge between real and simulated setups, the overall findings remain consistent. Specifically, partial automation of robot control improves performance and trust while reducing workload, and visual feedback decreases force deviation in both real and simulated conditions. These findings highlight the potential of XR for comparative studies, even in complex robotic tasks.},

While collaborative and remote design tools in MR have been widely explored in previous studies, a noticeable gap remains in the exploration of co-located product configuration for couples. This gap is noteworthy since in many industries, couples (e.g., friends, partners) often make purchasing decisions together in physical retail environments. In this paper, we introduce MR-CoCo, an open MR testbed designed to explore collaborative configurations by co-located couples, both in the role of customers. The testbed is developed in Unity and features: (i) a shared MR space with virtual product 3D model anchoring, (ii) shared visualization of the current configuration, (iii) a versatile UI for selecting configuration areas, (iv) hand gestures for 3D drag and drop of colors and materials from 3D catalog to the product. A case study of the personalization of a sailboat is provided as proof of concept. The user study involved 24 couples (48 participants in total), simulating a purchasing experience and the related configuration using MR-CoCo. We assessed usability through post-experience evaluations, with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Co-Presence Configuration Questionnaire (CCQ) to measure collaboration and decision-making. The results demonstrated a high level of usability and perceived quality of collaboration. We also explore guidelines that can be used for remote collaboration applications, enabling configuration across a wide range of industries (e.g., automotive and clothing).},

Guided by three core research questions, this review explores how HMD-mediated immersive technologies have been used to promote nature connectedness and well-being, what trends and outcomes have been observed across applications, and what methodological gaps or limitations exist in this growing body of work. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies were analyzed and categorized into six key implication areas: emotional well-being, stress reduction, cognitive performance, attention recovery, restorative benefits, and nature connectedness. The review identifies immersive virtual nature as a promising application of extended reality (XR) technologies, with potential across healthcare, education, and daily life, while also emphasizing the need for more consistent methodologies and long-term research.},

Avagents can interpret meeting context and generate appropriate responses to questions posed by asynchronous viewers. Through a user study (N =30), we evaluated Avagents against a traditional playback method and a voice-based AI assistant across two asynchronous meeting scenarios: analytic reasoning and affective resonance. Results showed that Avagents enhance the asynchronous communication experience by increasing social presence, sense of belonging, emotional intimacy, and other user perceptions. We discuss the findings and their implications for designing effective AI-driven asynchronous communication tools in VR/AR environments.},

Traditional teaching methods often struggle to convey abstract concepts in science, where many phenomena are not directly observable. VR can address this issue by modeling and visualizing complex and unobservable entities and processes, allowing learners to dynamically interact with what would otherwise not be directly perceptible. However, relatively few controlled studies have compared immersive VR learning with equivalent hands-on laboratory learning in physics education, particularly for more abstract topics. In this work, we designed a VR-based physics lab that is capable of visualizing electrons and electromagnetic fields to teach fundamental concepts of electronics and magnetism, closely replicating a traditional electronics learning kit used as a baseline for comparison. We evaluated the impact of the two conditions (VR versus traditional) on students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Our results show significantly higher knowledge retention in the VR group compared to the traditional group. Also, while there were no significant differences in immediate comprehension between the two groups, participants in the VR group spent substantially more time engaged with the learning content. These findings highlight the potential of visually enriched virtual environments to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge retention of intangible scientific concepts.},

Traditionally, AI voice assistants are activated through wake-up keywords, and since they are invisible, their method of appearance has not been a concern. However, for ECAs in AR, the question of how they should enter the user's space when summoned remains underexplored. In this paper, we focused on the plausibility of ECAs' entering action into the user's field of view in AR. We analyzed its impact on user experience, concentrating on perceived social presence and co-presence of the agent. Three entrance styles were chosen for comparison: an obviously impossible one, a possible one, and an intermediate one, alongside a voice-only condition. We designed and conducted a within-subjects study with 38 participants. Our results indicated that while the plausibility of the action had less impact on functionality compared to the embodiment itself, it significantly affected social/co-presence.

Our approach introduces affective visual cues including line shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines, and examines their influence on both affective responses (arousal, valence) and perceived roughness. Results show that sharp contours enhanced perceived roughness, increased arousal, and reduced valence, intensifying the emotional impact of haptic feedback. In contrast, color affected valence only, with red consistently lowering emotional positivity. These effects were especially noticeable at lower haptic intensities, where visual cues extended affective modulation into mid-level perceptual ranges. Overall, the findings highlight how integrating expressive visual cues with tactile feedback can enrich affective rendering and offer flexible emotional tuning in immersive VR interactions.},

Eye-tracking sensors play a key role in these advancements. At the same time, eye-tracking data is not well understood by users and can reveal sensitive information. Our work contributes visualizations based on visceral notice to increase privacy awareness of eye-tracking data in AR. We also evaluated user perceptions towards privacy noise mechanisms applied to gaze data visualized through these visceral interfaces. While privacy mechanisms have been evaluated against privacy attacks, we are the first to evaluate them subjectively and understand their influence on data-sharing attitudes. Despite our participants being highly concerned with eye-tracking privacy risks, we found 47% of our participants still felt comfortable sharing raw data. When applying privacy noise, 70% to 76% felt comfortable sharing their gaze data for the Weighted Smoothing and Gaussian Noise privacy mechanisms, respectively. This implies that participants are still willing to share raw gaze data even though overall data-sharing sentiments decreased after experiencing the visceral interfaces and privacy mechanisms. Our work implies that increased access and understanding of privacy mechanisms are critical for gaze-based AR applications; further research is needed to develop visualizations and experiences that relay additional information about how raw gaze data can be used for sensitive inferences, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. We intend to open-source our codebase to provide AR developers and platforms with the ability to better inform users about privacy concerns and provide access to privacy mechanisms.

We present Ada, the first open distributed, power-aware, application-agnostic real-time scene provisioning system. Through computation offloading along with algorithmic and system innovations, Ada provides high-fidelity scenes with stable performance across all evaluated scene sizes and with low power consumption. To isolate the benefits of Ada's algorithmic and design innovations over the closest prior work [82], which is on-device and CPU-based, we configure a comparable on-device, CPU-based variant of Ada (AdaLocal- CPU). We show this variant achieves up to 6.8× lower scene request latency and higher scene fidelity compared to the prior work. Furthermore, Ada's final distributed GPU-accelerated implementation reduces latency by an additional 2×, highlighting the benefits of GPU acceleration and distributed computing. Additionally, Ada also lowers the incremental power cost of scene provisioning by 24% compared to the best on-device variant (AdaLocal-GPU). Finally, Ada flexibly adapts to diverse latency, power, scene fidelity, and network bandwidth requirements.},

We present a user study that examines the effect of different hand visualizations (invisible, transparent, opaque) on manipulation performance when interacting with real and virtual objects. For this, we implemented video-see-through (VST) AR-based virtual building blocks and hot wire tasks with real one-to-one counterparts that require participants to use gross and fine motor hand movements. To evaluate manipulation performance, we considered three measures: task completion time, number of collisions (hot wire task), and percentage of object displacement (building block task). Additionally, we explored the sense of agency and subjective impressions (preference, ease of interaction, successful and awkwardness) evoked by the different hand-visualizations. The results show that (1) manipulation performance is significantly higher when interacting with real objects compared to virtual ones, (2) invisible hands lead to fewer errors, higher agency, higher perceived success and ease of interaction during fine manipulation tasks with real objects, and (3) having some visualization of the virtual hands (transparent or opaque) overlayed on the real hands is preferred when manipulating virtual objects even when there are no significant performance improvements. Our empirical findings about the differences when interacting with real and virtual objects can aid hand visualization choices for manipulation tasks in AR.},

  abstract     = {We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GSProCams is not only view-agnostic but also significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional co-located light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the projection surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and the global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It also uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory for training and is 900 times faster in inference speed.

  abstract     = {In educators' ongoing pursuit of enriching remote education, Virtual Reality (VR)-based telepresence has shown significant promise due to its immersive and interactive nature. Existing approaches often rely on point cloud or NeRF-based techniques to deliver realistic representations of teachers and classrooms to remote students. However, achieving low latency is non-trivial, and maintaining high-fidelity rendering under such constraints poses an even greater challenge. This paper introduces LiteAT, a data-lightweight and user-adaptive VR telepresence system, to enable real-time, immersive learning experiences. LiteAT employs a Gaussian Splatting-based reconstruction pipeline that integrates an SMPL-X–driven dynamic human model with a static classroom, supporting lightweight data transmission and high-quality rendering. To enable efficient and personalized exploration in the virtual classroom, we propose a user-adaptive viewpoint recommendation framework that dynamically suggests high-quality viewpoints tailored to user preferences. Candidate viewpoints are evaluated based on multiple visual quality factors and are continuously optimized based on recent user behavior and scene dynamics. Quantitative experiments and user studies validate the effectiveness of LiteAT across multiple evaluation metrics. LiteAT establishes a versatile and scalable foundation for immersive telepresence, potentially supporting real-time scenarios such as procedural teaching, multimodal instruction, and collaborative learning.},

  abstract     = {When communicating with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in virtual reality, there might be delays in the responses of the agents lasting several seconds, for example, due to more extensive computations of the answers when large language models are used. Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in eye-tracking technology have positioned gaze as an efficient and intuitive input method for Virtual Reality (VR), offering a natural and immersive user experience. As a result, gaze input is now leveraged for fundamental interaction tasks such as selection, manipulation, crossing, and steering. Although several studies have modeled user steering performance across various path characteristics and input methods, our understanding of gaze-based steering in VR remains limited. This gap persists because the unique qualities of eye movements—involving rapid, continuous motions—and the variability in eye-tracking make findings from other input modalities nontransferable to a gaze-based context, underscoring the need for a dedicated investigation into gaze-based steering behaviors and performance. To bridge this gap, we present two user studies to explore and model gaze-based steering. In the first one, user behavior data are collected across various path characteristics and eye-tracking conditions. Based on this data, we propose four refined models that extend the classic Steering Law to predict users' movement time in gaze-based steering tasks, explicitly incorporating the impact of tracking quality. The best-performing model achieves an adjusted R2 of 0.956, corresponding to a 16% improvement in movement time prediction. This model also yields a substantial reduction in AIC (from 1550 to 1132) and BIC (from 1555 to 1142), highlighting improved model quality and better balance between goodness of fit and model complexity. Finally, data from a second study with varied settings, such as a different eye-tracking sampling rate, illustrate the strong robustness and predictability of our models. Finally, we present scenarios and applications that demonstrate how our models can be used to design enhanced gaze-based interactions in VR systems.},

Depth-based object exploration is a common but underexplored task in XR environments, especially in settings without physical devices. Prior studies have largely focused on horizontal or planar interactions, leaving depthoriented exploration relatively overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose three linearly aligned layer transition techniques (Continuous Push, Push&Return, and Tilt&Return) specifically designed to support efficient, precise, and continuous object exploration along the depth axis within depth-based UIs. In a user study with 30 participants, we compared their performance, usability, and user preference across two different layer configurations (8-layer vs. 16-layer). The results highlight that Continuous Push enables faster exploration with lower effort, while Push&Return provides the highest accuracy and is most preferred by users. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for depth-based interaction techniques in controller-free XR environments.},

In each condition of our study, our participants co-solved a jigsaw puzzle with a virtual character that embodied combinations of personality and age. After each condition, participants completed a survey. We also asked them to provide written feedback at the end of the study. Our statistical analyses revealed that the virtual character's personality and age significantly influenced participants' perceptions and experiences. The personality factor affected perceptions of altruism, anthropomorphism, likability, safety, and all aspects of user experience, including perceived collaboration, rapport, emotional reactivity, and the desire for future interaction. Additionally, the virtual character's age affected our participants' ratings of the uncanny valley and likability. We also identified an interaction effect between personality and age factors on the virtual character's anthropomorphism.

  abstract     = {An optical-see-through near-eye display (NED) for augmented reality (AR) allows the user to perceive virtual and real imagery simultaneously. Existing technologies for optical-see-through AR NEDs involve trade-offs between key metrics such as field of view (FOV), eyebox size, form factor, etc. We have enhanced an existing compact wide-FOV pinlight AR NED design with real-time 3D pupil localization in order to dynamically steer and thus effectively enlarge the usable eyebox. This is achieved with a dual-camera rig that captures stereoscopic views of the pupils. The 3D pupil location is used to dynamically calculate a display pattern that spatio-temporally modulates the light entering the wearer's eyes. We have built a demonstrable compact prototype and have conducted a user study that indicates the effectiveness of our eyebox steering method (e.g., without eyebox steering, in 10.5% of our tests, users were unable to perceive the test pattern correctly before experiment timeout; with eyebox steering, that fraction decreased dramatically to 1.25%). This is a small yet crucial step in making simple wide-FOV pinlight NEDs usable for human users and not just as demonstration prototypes filmed with a precisely positioned camera standing in for the user's eye. Further contributions of this paper include a detailed description of display design, calibration technique, and user study design, all of which may benefit other NED research.},

Each layer of the architecture is dedicated to a specific facet of air combat, enhancing clarity and inter-pretability. By incorporating an adversarial situation memory library, typical air combat scenarios are quantitatively analyzed, resulting in the development of a tactical scenario library that surpasses conventional expert knowledge bases in air combat. At the foundational layer, an aircraft's parameterized flight maneuver action library is established based on its characteristic flight curve, ensuring stable maneuvering strategies during confrontations. The Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) model, embodying typical supersonic fighter dynamics characteristics, is tested in a close-range confrontation scenario of one-on-one air combat. The results show that the architecture outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a relative winning rate of at least 61% under similar initial energy conditions.},

The architecture takes environment images captured at the base station (BS) and coordinates text collected from GPS sensors equipped on targets as input, training the network to predict the optimal beam index. The semantic-aware network preprocesses the environment images captured at the BS, extracting key semantic images relevant to communication targets and discarding redundant environmental semantics to reduce data storage and computational complexity. In the multimodal fusion module, we employ a multimodal compact bilinear pooling (MCBP) method to reduce the complexity of outer product calculations, mapping the highdimensional results of the outer product to a lower-dimensional space for a more compact and efficient representation. Simulation results indicate that the beam prediction scheme proposed in this paper can achieve satisfactory accuracy without the need for pilot overhead and beam measurement and efficient prediction with low computational complexity.},

Furthermore, performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of battery efficiency and collision avoidance, outperforming existing benchmark algorithms.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an online fusion method for estimating the road adhesion coefficient that integrates image-based and vehicle dynamic data. First, a threedegree- of-freedom vehicle dynamic model is employed, and correction factors are introduced into the Dugoff tire model to enable adaptive cornering stiffness calculation. Next, to leverage visual information effectively, the range of the road adhesion coefficients obtained from a residual network is incorporated as the upper and lower bounds of constraints in the moving horizon estimation method. Additionally, a detailed stability proof for the moving horizon estimation method is provided. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method is validated through both software simulation and vehicle tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimation method achieves high estimation accuracy and rapid convergence.},

  abstract     = {Emerging applications such as smart cities and smart transportation require sub-decimeter accuracy in user equipment (UE) location services to enhance safety and reliability. Therefore, robust high-accuracy positioning technology is crucial for these applications. However, existing two-step positioning methods rely on numerical solutions, which are susceptible to non-ideal factors, resulting in non-convergent solution errors of several meters, rendering accurate multi-target positioning difficult. We propose a cellular base station (BS) positioning method for UE based on a multi-signal fusion passive imaging algorithm. The proposed approach provides highly robust location services with sub-decimeter-level accuracy and enables simultaneous multi-target positioning. The algorithm decouples the phase difference from UE to distributed BSs into spatial frequency and reconstructs the spatial spectrum by fusing spatially sampled frequency points from the UE uplink multisignal. The UE is imaged as a point target to obtain its spatial distribution information. With the fusion of multi-signal received by distributed BSs, the integral side-lobe ratio and minimum discernible distance are improved, and the non-line-of-sight interference is suppressed, thus enhancing the robustness of positioning accuracy. Compared with the existing two-step methods through simulation, the proposed method demonstrates more robust positioning accuracy under the same non-ideal conditions. Field experiments demonstrate a maximum positioning error of approximately 5 cm, with decimeter-level accuracy even when the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates to −15 dB. Additionally, multi-target positioning can be achieved directly without data association limitations.},

  abstract     = {Digital predistortion (DPD) technology can compensate for the nonlinear distortion when the power amplifier (PA) works in the saturated region. To achieve linearity of each radio frequency (RF) link, it is necessary to configure the DPD separately for each PA, which results in the increasing hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a novel nonlinear distortion suppression scheme combining precoding and predistortion is proposed for maximizing spectral efficiency (SE) as well as reducing hardware complexity and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission systems. To realize predistortion, a partially connected intermediate frequency (IF) architecture is designed, where DPDs are configured for partial RF links based on a distortion power-aware configuration (DPAC) method. To compile precoding, the SE maximization problems with total power constraints (TPC) and per-link power constraints (PLPC) are formulated based on the partially connected IF architecture. Moreover, a local optimal solution is obtained by a gradient projection method. Compared with the traditional zero-forcing precoding scheme, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of DPDs by up to 86.2% with the same SE and the RF front-end energy efficiency (EE) can be improved by up to 39.5% with the same number of DPDs.},

Moreover, it ensures that the filter error remains within finite-time bounds and satisfies the specified H ∞ performance index to further improve the dynamic performance of the filter. Based on this, an ellipsoid detector is designed for detecting cyber-attacks in vehicle platoon. Then, the above issues are transformed into optimization problem based on linear matrix inequality, from which the filter parameters and the boundary of ellipsoid detector are obtained. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed detector has strong robustness to UBB noises and can effectively distinguish the cyber-attacks from external disturbances, and the detection sensitivity of small attack signal is better than that of χ2 detector with Kalman filter.},

The formation transformation can improve the flexibility of ASV formation and enable it to perform complex tasks. Since ASVs need to transmit measurement data via a wireless network, the performance of the system can be affected by DoS attacks and limited communication resources. The DoS attacks block the communication channel between ASVs and prevent the transmission of measurement data. To deal with these problems, a novel dynamic event-based affine formation control strategy is designed. Then, the stability of the system is analyzed. The sufficient conditions for ensuring system stability are provided, along with the tolerance for the duration of DoS attacks. Furthermore, it is proven that the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) has a positive lower bound for its triggering intervals. This ensures the absence of Zeno behavior and the feasibility of the proposed ETM. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by numerical simulation.},

However, due to the limited availability of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative diffusion model (CDiff).

  abstract     = {In the realm of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems, the utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing has garnered significant attention. However, OAM beams are subject to atmospheric turbulence (AT) during transmission in free space, resulting in distortions of the phase front, intermodal crosstalk, and mode-dependent loss (MDL). While techniques such as adaptive optics and digital signal processing can mitigate these effects, inconsistencies in OAM mode performance persist due to MDL. Some studies have evaluated an MDL-impaired mode division multiplexing system for non-unitary multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels based on maximum likelihood detection. Nevertheless, the computational complexity remains considerably higher compared to simpler yet suboptimal advanced MIMO decoders, such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) with zero-forcing/minimum mean square error (ZF/MMSE). On the other hand, an OAM mode and radial index are two distinct indices of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with the potential to carry a large amount of information. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have explored the impact and mitigation strategies for MDL induced by atmospheric turbulence in an FSO system utilizing both OAM mode and radial index multiplexing with MMSE-SIC receiver. This paper introduces OAM multiplexing holography to generate OAM modes. We perform both analytical and numerical analyses of the orbital angular momentum spectra associated with distorted single-mode and multiplexed LG beams. This is achieved by generating holograms, incorporating random phase screens along the propagation path, and varying the refractive index structure constants. We mathematically develop and simulate an MMSE-SIC receiver for OAM multiplexed FSO for different radial values for the first time and compared its BER to Zero Forcing-SIC and K-best detectors. Additionally, orthogonal space-time block coding is employed at the transmitter to enhance the overall performance of the system.},

Subsequently, by considering the effect of user association, XL-IRS phase shift, and UAV 3D trajectory, we formulate a penalty-based alternate optimization (AO) ACR maximization problem, which consists of inner and outer loops. Herein, the penalty factor and auxiliary penalty variable are introduced to transform the binary variable representing the user association into a continuous variable. In the outer loop, the penalty factor can be updated by a linear function, enabling the continuous variable to approximate 0 or 1. In the inner loop, the user association subproblem is optimized first, the XL-IRS phase shift subproblem is optimized by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and then the UAV trajectory subproblem is optimized by successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Based on the outcomes of the above subproblems, the closed solution of the penalty variable is obtained. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of ACR.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the potential of dual-polarized (DP) technology with holographic multiple-input multi-output (HMIMO) surfaces. The primary goal is to mitigate the mutual interference between communication and sensing signals in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By leveraging distinct polarization resources, DP enables the simultaneous transmission of both signal types within the same frequency and spatial domain. However, excessive transmission power will lead to increased polarization leakage. To address it, a robust power control scheme is proposed based on the DP ISAC channel model. In both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, our primary focus is minimizing power consumption while suppressing cross-polarization interference and ensuring optimal communication and sensing performance. Due to the massive number of antennas in HMIMO and the presence of multiple users and sensing targets, the problem becomes high-dimensional and highly non-convex, making it extremely challenging to solve. To address this challenge, a novel differential evolution-successive convex approximation (DE-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Through the deliberate integration of mutation and crossover mechanisms, our approach effectively navigates the high-dimensional precoding matrix space. Moreover, we devise a tailored convexification strategy to systematically reformulate the non-convex constraints, transforming the objective into a solvable convex optimization subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that the synergy of global exploration and local refinement enhances both solution efficiency and convergence speed, particularly in large-scale HMIMO systems. The proposed algorithm achieves better communication and sensing performance with less power consumption. Additionally, it attains higher polarization diversity gain compared to conventional MIMO systems.},

  abstract     = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) can provide communication and computing services for Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) in the absence of ground cellular network coverage. In this paper, we propose an edge computing architecture based on SAGIN, comprising three parts: a satellite, UAVs, and ground-based IoRT devices. The satellite is responsible for providing access to cloud computing resources. UAVs are equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. And IoRT devices generate latency-sensitive tasks but possess limited computing capabilities. Our objective is to minimize task processing delays by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, computation offloading, and time slot resource allocation to meet the increasing demands of IoRT devices. Specifically, the proposed problem is decomposed into two components. First, for the deployment of multiple UAVs, we propose a multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradient (MASD3) approach, which enables UAVs to adjust their flight trajectories based solely on observed information for adaptive deployment. Second, for the computation offloading and time slot resource allocation problems in SAGIN, we employ a numerical computation-based iterative optimization method to minimize the occupation of time slots by computation offloading. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution significantly reduces overall delay compared to alternative benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Compact spectrum sensing (SS) is crucial for optimizing wireless network performance, particularly within dynamic 5 G NR and LTE environments. TThe effectiveness of traditional SS methods in real-world scenarios is often limited by challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, multipath fading, and high computational complexity. Deep learning-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions by offering superior adaptability and performance. However, existing DL models often suffer from computational costs and excessive storage requirements, thus constraining deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Resolution-Preserving Network (RPNet), integrated with a Convolutional Layer Reuse (CLRu) technique, to enhance SS efficiency while reducing model size significantly. RPNet is designed to maintain the resolution of spectrogram input throughout its architecture, preserving critical spatial details for segmentation. CLRu optimizes memory usage by reusing convolutional layers, effectively reducing the number of trainable parameters with very slightly compromising performance. Extensive simulations on a synthetic 5G-LTE dataset demonstrate that RPNet+CLRu achieves a greater than $9 \times$ reduction in model size while maintaining 87.45% segmentation accuracy. In addition, the proposed model outperforms existing deep models in storage efficiency and computational feasibility, hence presenting it as a promising candidate for real-time SS in next-generation wireless networks.},

  abstract     = {Movable antenna (MA) technique has emerged as a promising 6G technology due to its flexible deployment and ability to enhance spatial diversity. However, the performance gain depends on the availability of precise angular-domain information. In this paper, we investigate a robust resource allocation (RA) problem for a multiple-input single-output downlink MA-enabled communication system, where angular-domain uncertainties are considered. The RA problem is formulated to maximize the system's total energy efficiency (EE), subject to the maximum transmit power constraint of the base station, the minimum rate constraint of each user, the minimum distance constraints of MAs, and the uncertainty constraints. To deal with the formulated non-convex problem, we first derive an analytical upper bound on the uncertainties of the field response matrix to exactly evaluate the impact of angle errors. Then, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by applying the Dinkelbach's method and the block coordinate descent approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 19.8% higher EE and a 24.9% reduction in outage probability compared to baseline algorithms.},

Hybrid precoding is performed instead of conventional fully digital precoding to reduce the number of expensive and power-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains. Passive precoding. achieved by designing the reflecting coefficients of RIS, is performed together with transmit precoding and power allocation among different users to maximize energy efficiency of the system. By considering the use of zero-forcing (ZF) fully digital transmit precoder, the energy efficiency maximization problem is reduced to solving only passive precoding and power allocation which is achieved through alternating optimization technique. The passive precoding is attained through greedy optimization in phase, whereas power allocation is obtained by the method of Lagrange multipliers using Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. The energy efficient passive precoding is further advanced through switching off of individual RIS elements accomplished through a low-complexity algorithm. Finally, hybrid ZF precoder is designed from the fully digital precoder. We show, through simulation results, that the proposed design delivers performance better than the existing solution, while entailing lower complexity.},

  abstract     = {The increasing complexity of collaborative and distributed edge computing networks necessitates efficient management of result caching and deduplication to optimize storage and reduce redundant processing. Traditional caching strategies often suffer from storage inefficiencies and computational overhead due to excessive result duplication across edge servers. To address this challenge, we propose a convex optimization framework for result deduplication and relocation (COFRDR) that strategically reallocates cached results while maintaining service quality. Unlike conventional heuristics, our approach transforms the inherently NP-hard result deduplication and relocation problem into a continuous convex optimization framework, allowing for faster convergence and better scalability across large-scale collaborative and distributed edge computing networks (CDECN). We introduce a fairness-aware storage balancing mechanism and a latency-space benefit (LSB) model to ensure optimal storage utilization across edge servers. A rounding algorithm is further integrated to map continuous solutions back to the binary domain, ensuring practical deployability. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in storage efficiency, deduplication ratio (DR), and latency reduction compared to existing heuristics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for future large-scale edge computing infrastructures, meeting the increasing demand for real-time, low-latency processing in IoT-driven environments.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks should be with great potentials to coordinate traffic scheduling and ensure road safety, where cloud-edge-end vehicular networks have been as promising paradigms to improve vehicle scheduling efficiency according to user task intents. However, as user demands become increasingly complex and diverse, task intent decomposition is crucial for handling the diversity of task intents and the complexity of their content. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in task intents and vehicular network node resources lead to uncertainty in the task execution, which significantly reduces vehicle scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present an intent-driven task-oriented resource collaboration framework, referred to as ITRC, which consists of the intent, policy, and infrastructure layers from a top to bottom perspective. Specifically, we propose a coarseto-fine complex intent decomposition algorithm assisted by a generative pre-trained transformer. To mitigate hallucination during the decomposition, a hybrid hallucination suppression mechanism is introduced based on similarity analysis and natural language inference. Furthermore, the task-resource uncertainty is solved using a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and an efficient optimal allocation algorithm is proposed for dynamic task scheduling. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms compared baseline methods across multiple metrics. In terms of quality of service, it reduces end-to-end latency by 60% to 89%; in terms of resource utilization, it achieves improvements ranging from 5% to 110%. For task distribution balance, the algorithm significantly reduces the variance of resource allocation across nodes to mitigate load imbalance, with the standard deviation decreasing by 38% to 87%. In terms of execution efficiency, the proposed algorithm maintains the shortest running time across all task scales and avoids the exponential time complexity typically observed in traditional optimization algorithms, demonstrating strong scalability and real-time performance.},
