  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising technique for high-quality 3D rendering, leading to increasing interest in integrating 3DGS into realism SLAM systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as Gaussian primitives redundancy, forgetting problem during continuous optimization, and difficulty in initializing primitives in monocular case due to lack of depth information. In order to achieve efficient and photorealistic mapping, we propose RP-SLAM, a 3D Gaussian splatting-based vision SLAM method for monocular and RGB-D cameras. RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency. Finally, for the monocular case, a monocular keyframe initialization method based on sparse point cloud is proposed to improve the initialization accuracy of Gaussian primitives, which provides a geometric basis for subsequent optimization. The results of numerous experiments demonstrate that RP-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art map rendering accuracy while ensuring real-time performance and model compactness.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable speed and performance in novel view synthesis but suffers from overfitting and degraded reconstruction when handling sparse-view inputs. This paper innovatively addresses this challenge from a learning-to-optimize perspective by leveraging a learned optimizer (i.e., a multi-layer perceptron, MLP) to update the relevant parameters of 3DGS during the optimization process. Evidently, using a single MLP to handle all optimization variables, whose numbers may even vary during the optimization process, is impossible. Therefore, we present a point-wise position-aware optimizer that updates the parameters for each 3DGS point individually. Specifically, it takes the point coordinates and corresponding parameter values as input to predict the updates, thereby allowing efficient and adaptive optimization. In the case of sparse view modeling, the learned optimizer imposes position-aware constraints on the parameter updates during optimization. This effectively encourages the relevant parameters to converge stably to better solutions. To update the optimizer's parameters, we propose a dynamic gradient update strategy based on spatial perturbation and weighted fusion, enabling the optimizer to capture broader contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the problem of modeling 3DGS from sparse training views, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.},

In mixed reality (MR), where users see the real world and their own hands, haptic redirection enables a physical interaction with virtual objects but poses greater challenges due to altering real-world perception. This paper investigates the effect of the realism of the user's surroundings and of the user's hand on haptic redirection. The user's familiarity with their actual physical surroundings and their actual hand could make the redirection manipulations easier–or harder–to detect. In a user study (N = 30) participants saw either a virtual environment or their actual physical surroundings, and saw their hand rendered either with a generic 3D model or with a live 2D video sprite of their actual hand. The study used a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) design asking participants to detect hand redirections that bridged physical to virtual offsets of varying magnitudes. The results show that participants were not more sensitive to 2D video sprite hand redirection than to VR hand redirection, which supports the use of haptic redirection in MR.},

While prior work has focused on preventing misalignment, less is known about how teams recover when alignment fails. We examine collaboration under scale asymmetry, a particularly disruptive form of perceptual divergence. In a study with 36 VR teams, we identify behavioral patterns that distinguish adaptive recovery from persistent breakdown. Successful teams flexibly shifted between user-driven and system-supported cues, while others repeated ineffective strategies. Based on these findings, we introduce the Perceptual Asymmetry Coordination Theory (PACT), a dual-pathway model that describes coordination as an evolving process shaped by cue integration and strategic responsiveness. PACT reframes recovery not as a return to alignment, but as a dynamic adaptation to misalignment. These insights inform the design of VR systems that support recovery through multi-channel, adaptive coordination in scale-divergent environments.},

Specifically, we investigate how 1) idle behavior, 2) AI-generated gestures, and 3) motion-captured movements from a confederate (a controlled partner in the study) influence the quality of conversation and how that partner is perceived. We examined these effects in both symmetric interactions (where both participants use VR headsets and controllers) and asymmetric interactions (where one participant uses a desktop setup). We developed a social XR platform that supports asymmetric device configurations to provide varying levels of immersion. The platform also supports a modular avatar animation system providing idle behavior, real-time AI-generated co-speech gestures, and full-body motion capture. Using a 2×3 mixed design with 39 participants, we measured users' sense of spatial presence, their perception of the confederate, and the overall conversation quality. Our results show that users who were more immersed felt a stronger sense of presence and viewed their partner as more human-like and believable. Surprisingly, however, the type of avatar animation did not significantly affect conversation quality or how the partner was perceived. Participants often reported focusing more on what was said rather than how the avatar moved.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a fundamental role in extended reality (XR) applications. As the standards for immersion in XR continue to increase, the demands for SLAM benchmarking have become more stringent. Trajectory accuracy is the key metric, and marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap) systems are widely used to generate ground truth (GT) because of their drift-free and relatively accurate measurements. However, the precision of MoCap-based GT is limited by two factors: the spatiotemporal calibration with the device under test (DUT) and the inherent jitter in the MoCap measurements. These limitations hinder accurate SLAM benchmarking, particularly for key metrics like rotation error and inter-frame jitter, which are critical for immersive XR experiences. This paper presents a novel continuous-time maximum likelihood estimator to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates auxiliary inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to compensate for MoCap jitter. Additionally, a variable time synchronization method and a pose residual based on screw congruence constraints are proposed, enabling precise spatiotemporal calibration across multiple sensors and the DUT. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving the precision necessary for comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms in XR applications. Furthermore, we thoroughly validate the practicality of our method by benchmarking several leading XR devices and open-source SLAM algorithms.

Existing labeled resources have been utilized to aid this task via transfer learning, which aligns the distribution of unlabeled data with the source one. However, the labeled resource are not always accessible due to the privacy disputes, limited computational capacity and other thorny restrictions. Therefore, we propose source-free model adaptation task for unsupervised 3D object management, which utilizes a pre-trained model to boost the performance with no access to source data and labels. Specifically, we compute representative prototypes to assume the source feature distribution, and design a bidirectional cumulative confidence-based adaptation strategy to adaptively align unlabeled samples towards prototypes. Subsequently, a dual-model distillation mechanism is proposed to generate source hypothesis for remedying the absence of ground-truth labels. The experiments on a cross-domain retrieval benchmark NTU-PSB (PSB-NTU) and a cross-modality retrieval benchmark MI3DOR also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method even without access to raw data.

A different way of thinking about edge bundling is to simultaneously optimize both the drawing and the bundling, which we investigate in this paper. We build on an earlier work where we introduced a novel algorithmic framework for bundling-aware graph drawing consisting of three main steps, namely Filter for a skeleton subgraph, Draw the skeleton, and Bundle the remaining edges against the drawing of the skeleton. We propose several alternative implementations and experimentally compare them against each other and the simple idea of first drawing the full graph and subsequently applying edge bundling to it.

However, complications from perceptual challenges in Virtual Reality (VR), combined with the ergonomic and cognitive challenges of sketching in all three dimensions in mid-air lower the accuracy and aesthetic quality of 3D sketches. This paper explores how color-to-depth and opacity cues support users to create and perceive freehand, 3D strokes in room-scale sketching, unlocking a full 360°of freedom for creation. We implemented three graphic depth shader cues modifying the (1) alpha, (2) hue, and (3) value levels of a single color to dynamically adjust the color and transparency of meshes relative to their depth from the user. We investigated how these depth cues influence sketch efficiency, sketch quality, and total sketch experience with 24 participants in a comparative, counterbalanced, 4 × 1 within-subjects user study. First, with our graphic depth shader cues we could successfully transfer results of prior research in seated sketching tasks to room-scale scenarios. Our color-to-depth cues improved the similarity of sketches to target models. This highlights the usefulness of the color-to-depth approach even for the increased range of motion and depth in room-scale sketching. Second, our shaders assisted participants to complete tasks faster, spend a greater percentage of task time sketching, reduced the feeling of mental tiredness and improved the feeling of sketch efficiency in room-scale sketching. We discuss these findings and share our insights and conclusions to advance the research on improving spatial cognition in immersive sketching systems.},

  abstract     = {Swarm fragmentation, the breakdown of communication and coordination among robots, can critically compromise a swarm's mission. Integrating Augmented Reality support into swarm monitoring—especially through co-located visualisations anchored directly on the robots— may enable human operators to detect early signs of fragmentation and intervene effectively. In this work, we propose three localised visual cues—targeting robot connectivity, dominant decision influences, and movement direction—to make explicit the underlying Perception-Decision-Action (PDA) loop of each robot. Through an immersive Virtual Reality user study, 51 participants were tasked with both anticipating potential fragmentation and selecting the appropriate control to prevent it, while observing swarms exhibiting expansion, densification, flocking, and swarming behaviours. Our results reveal that a visualisation emphasising inter-robot connectivity significantly improves anticipation of fragmentation, though none of the cues consistently enhance control selection over a baseline condition. These findings underscore the potential of co-located AR-enhanced visual feedback to support human-swarm interaction and inform the design of future AR-based supervisory systems for robot swarms.

  abstract     = {With the advent of consumer-targeted, low-cost virtual reality devices and facile authoring technologies, the development and design of experiences in virtual reality are also becoming more accessible to non-expert authors. However, the inherent freedom of exploration in these virtual spaces presents a significant challenge for designers seeking to guide user attention toward points and objects of interest. This paper proposes the new technique WarpVision, which utilizes spatial curvature to subtly guide the user's attention in virtual reality. WarpVision distorts an area around the point of interest, thus changing the size, form, and location of all objects and the space around them. In this way, the user's attention can be guided even when the point of interest is not in the immediate field of vision. WarpVision is evaluated in a user study based on a within-subjects design, comparing it to the state-of-the-art technique Deadeye. Participants completed visual search tasks across two virtual environments being supported with WarpVision at four different intensities. Results show that WarpVision significantly reduces search times compared to Deadeye. While both techniques introduce comparable levels of immersion disruption, WarpVision has a lower reported impact on the user's well-being.},

  abstract     = {This study explores how human and AI visual attention differ in a short-term prediction task, particularly in the moments before an accident is about to happen. Since real-world studies of this kind would pose ethical and safety risks, we employed virtual reality (VR) to simulate an accident scenario. In the scenario, the driver approaches a fork in the road, knowing that one path would lead off a cliff crashing the car fatally—as the fork comes closer, the other, safe, path is suddenly blocked by trees, forcing the driver to make a split-second decision where to go. A total of $N = 71$ drivers completed the task, and we asked another $N = 30$ observers to watch short video clips leading up to the final event and to predict which way the driver would take. We then compared both prediction accuracy as well as attention patterns—how focus is distributed across objects—with AI systems, including vision language models (VLMs) and vision-only models. We found that overall, prediction performance increased as the accident time point approached; interestingly, humans fared better than AI systems overall except for the final time period just before the event. We also found that humans adapted their attention dynamically, shifting focus to important scene elements before an event, whereas AI attention remained static, overlooking key details of the scene. Importantly, as the accident time point approached, human-AI attentional alignment decreased, even though both types of models improved in prediction accuracy. Despite distinct temporal trajectories—vision-only models declining from an early advantage and VLMs peaking in the middle—both models achieved low to zero alignment with human attention. These findings highlight a critical dissociation: AI models make accurate predictions, but rely on visual strategies diverging from human processing, underscoring a gap between explainability and task performance.},

  abstract     = {In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), accurate size perception is critical, especially in training simulations designed to mimic real-world tasks, such as, nuclear power plant control room or medical procedures. These simulations have dials or instruments of varying sizes. Visual information of the objects alone, often fails to capture subtle size differences in virtual reality (VR). However, integrating haptic and hand-avatars may potentially improve accuracy and performance. This improvement could be especially beneficial for real-world scenarios where hand(s) are intermittently visible or obscured. To investigate how this intermittent presence or absence of body-scaled hand-avatars affects size perception when integrated with haptic information, we conducted 2×2 mixed-factorial experiment design using a near-field, size-estimation task in VR. The experiment conditions compared size estimations with or without virtual hand visibility in the perception and reporting phases. The task involved 16 graspable objects of varying sizes and randomly repeated 3 times across 48 trials per participant (total 80 participants). We employed Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) analysis to objective measures: perceived size, residual error and proportional errors. Results revealed that as the tangible-graspable size increases, overestimation reduces if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Also, overestimation reduces as the number of trials increases, if the hand-avatars are visible in the reporting phase. Thus, the presence of hand-avatars facilitated perceptual calibration. This novel study, with different combinations of hand-avatar visibility, taking perception and reporting of size as two separate phases, could open future research directions in more complex scenarios for refined integration of sensory modalities and consequently enhance real-world application performance.},

  abstract     = {Handheld haptic devices often face challenges in delivering stiffness feedback with both high force output and good backdrivability, especially under practical constraints on power consumption, size, and weight. These difficulties stem from the inherent performance limitations of conventional actuation mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, low-power handheld device that provides wide-range stiffness feedback through a novel dual actuation design composed of two key components. A programmable spring (PS), implemented via an adjustable lever arm, enables tunable physical stiffness. Two electrostatic clutches (ECs) are integrated to compensate for the inherent limitations of PS-based interactions in stiffness display range, rendered object size, and free motion capability. The feedback force arises passively from the reaction of the PS and ECs to user input, effectively lowering both power consumption and actuator torque demands. A fully integrated prototype was developed, incorporating wireless communication, control, and power modules. The results of the evaluation experiments and user studies demonstrate that the device effectively renders stiffness across the full range, from free motion to full rigidity, and delivers more realistic elastic feedback compared to conventional electric motor-based systems.},

  abstract     = {Zoning out, a form of cognitive disengagement, seriously challenges the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) based upper limb rehabilitation. As therapy often involves repetitive tasks requiring sustained attention, undetected lapses in focus can reduce motor learning, engagement, and overall recovery outcomes. This research addresses this gap by proposing ZonAware, a novel strategy integrating real-time zoning out detection with adaptive intervention to enhance user engagement during VR rehabilitation. ZonAware identifies zoning out using five eye-tracking metrics: blink frequency, blink duration, pupil size, eye openness, and gaze duration. These signals are analysed through lightweight statistical models (Z-Score, Boxplot, and Modified Z-Score), with a hard voting mechanism producing binary classifications in real-time. Upon detection, a pattern changing intervention subtly modulates task difficulty by temporarily increasing, then decreasing it, to regain user focus without breaking immersion. Three user studies involving 70 healthy participants and 22 patients demonstrated the strategy's effectiveness. ZonAware achieved 98.24% detection accuracy with low latency (82–150 ms), reducing zoning out frequency by 53.57% and shortening disengagement duration from 18.1 to 4.8 seconds. The approach also improved user engagement, performance, and emotional motivation. ZonAware delivers one of the first real-time zoning out solutions for VR rehabilitation, offering an interpretable, theory-driven approach that enhances attention, engagement, and adaptability in human-computer interaction.},

Co-located XR systems predominantly rely on prefabricated passive props that provide high-fidelity interaction but offer limited adaptability. Haptic Illusions (HIs), which leverage multisensory integration, have proven effective in expanding haptic experiences in single-user contexts. However, their role in XR collaboration has not been explored. To examine the applicability of HIs in multi-user scenarios, we conducted an experimental user study (N=30) investigating their effect on a collaborative object handover task in virtual reality. We manipulated visual shape and size individually and analyzed their impact on users' performance, experience, and behavior. Results show that while participants adapted to the illusions by shifting sensory reliance and employing specific sensorimotor strategies, visuo-haptic mismatches reduced both performance and experience. Moreover, mismatched visualizations in asymmetric user roles negatively impacted performance. Drawing from these findings, we provide practical guidelines for incorporating HIs into collaborative XR, marking a first step toward richer haptic interactions in shared virtual spaces.},

There is a lot of work on wearable or mobile AR displays, but little on how users interact with LTTS. Our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of natural user interaction for these AR displays. To this end, we developed a prototype and evaluated different pointing techniques for selecting 12 physical targets behind an LTTS, with distances ranging from 6 to 401 cm. We conducted a user study with 16 participants and measured user preferences, performance, and behavior. We analyzed the change in accuracy depending on the target position and the selection technique used. Our fndings include: (a) Users naturally align the touch point with their line of sight for targets farther than 36 cm behind the LTTS. (b) This technique provides the lowest angular deviation compared to other techniques. (c) Some user close one eye to improve their performance.

However, unlike instance-segmentation-driven setups, generating semantic scene graphs still suffer from limited accuracy due to coarse and noisy point cloud data typically acquired in practice, and from the lack of interactive strategies to incorporate users, spatialized and intuitive guidance. We identify three key challenges: designing controllable interaction forms, involving guidance in inference, and generalizing from local corrections. To address these, we propose SGSG, a Stroke-Guided Scene Graph generation method that enables users to interactively refine 3D semantic relationships and improve predictions in real time. We propose three types of strokes and a lightweight SGstrokes dataset tailored for this modality. Our model integrates stroke guidance representation and injection for spatio-temporal feature learning and reasoning correction, along with intervention losses that combine consistency-repulsive and geometry-sensitive constraints to enhance accuracy and generalization. Experiments and the user study show that SGSG outperforms state-of-the-art methods 3DSSG and SGFN in overall accuracy and precision, surpasses JointSSG in predicate-level metrics, and reduces task load across all control conditions, establishing SGSG as a new benchmark for interactive 3D scene graph generation and semantic understanding in XR.

Results show that participants experienced a compelling depth perception even from off-center angles of 23°–37°, and largely increasing virtual depth worsens depth perception and presence factors, highlighting the importance of balancing extended depth of virtual space and viewing distance from the wall-sized display.

Therefore, we explored the effects of three AR guidance positions (top, middle, and bottom) within a body-fixed coordinate system on pedestrian navigation in a virtual environment. Our results showed that AR guidance position significantly influenced eye movements, walking behaviors, and subjective evaluations. The top position resulted in the shortest duration of fixations on the guidance compared to the middle and bottom positions, and lower mental demand than the bottom position. The middle position had the smallest rate of vertical eye movement during gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment, and the smallest relative difference in walking speed between fixations on the guidance and the environment compared to the top and bottom positions. The bottom position led to the shortest duration and smallest amplitude of gaze shifts between the guidance and the environment compared to the top and middle positions, and lower frustration than the top position. Based on these findings, we offer design implications for AR guidance positioning within a body-fixed coordinate system during pedestrian navigation.},

Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized mental health conditions, and stigma is prevalent particularly among healthcare professionals. In this study, we investigated whether Virtual Reality (VR) can be incorporated into interventions to reduce stigma. In particular, we compared the effectiveness of three VR conditions based on intergroup contact theory in reducing stigma in form of implicit and explicit attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Through an immersive virtual consultation in a clinical setting, participants (N = 60) experienced one of three different conditions: the Doctor's perspective (embodiment in a majority group member during contact), the Patient's perspective (embodiment in a minority group member) and a Third-person perspective (vicarious contact). Results demonstrated an increase of stigma on certain explicit measures (perceived recovery and social restriction) but also an increase of empathy (perspective-taking, empathic concern) across all conditions regardless of perspective. More importantly, participants' viewpoint influenced the desire for social distance differently depending on the perspective: the Third-person observation significantly increased the desire for social distance, Doctor embodiment marginally decreased it, while Patient embodiment showed no significant change. No change was found in the Implicit Association Test.

  abstract     = {Extended Reality (XR) has the potential to improve efficiency and safety in the user-centered development of human-robot interaction. However, the validity of using XR prototyping for user studies for contact-intensive robotic tasks remains underexplored. These in-contact tasks are particularly relevant due to challenges arising from indirect force perception in robot control. Therefore, in this work, we investigate a representative example of such a task: robotic ultrasound. A user study was conducted to assess the transferability of results from a simulated user study to real-world conditions, comparing two force-assistance approaches. The XR simulation replicates the physical study set-up employing a virtual robotic arm, its control interface, ultrasound imaging, and two force-assistance methods: automation and force visualization. Our results indicate that while differences in force deviation, perceived workload, and trust emerge between real and simulated setups, the overall findings remain consistent. Specifically, partial automation of robot control improves performance and trust while reducing workload, and visual feedback decreases force deviation in both real and simulated conditions. These findings highlight the potential of XR for comparative studies, even in complex robotic tasks.},

  abstract     = {The literature has demonstrated the advantages of Mixed Reality (MR) for product configuration by providing a more engaging and effective end-user experience. While collaborative and remote design tools in MR have been widely explored in previous studies, a noticeable gap remains in the exploration of co-located product configuration for couples. This gap is noteworthy since in many industries, couples (e.g., friends, partners) often make purchasing decisions together in physical retail environments. In this paper, we introduce MR-CoCo, an open MR testbed designed to explore collaborative configurations by co-located couples, both in the role of customers. The testbed is developed in Unity and features: (i) a shared MR space with virtual product 3D model anchoring, (ii) shared visualization of the current configuration, (iii) a versatile UI for selecting configuration areas, (iv) hand gestures for 3D drag and drop of colors and materials from 3D catalog to the product. A case study of the personalization of a sailboat is provided as proof of concept. The user study involved 24 couples (48 participants in total), simulating a purchasing experience and the related configuration using MR-CoCo. We assessed usability through post-experience evaluations, with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Co-Presence Configuration Questionnaire (CCQ) to measure collaboration and decision-making. The results demonstrated a high level of usability and perceived quality of collaboration. We also explore guidelines that can be used for remote collaboration applications, enabling configuration across a wide range of industries (e.g., automotive and clothing).},

Guided by three core research questions, this review explores how HMD-mediated immersive technologies have been used to promote nature connectedness and well-being, what trends and outcomes have been observed across applications, and what methodological gaps or limitations exist in this growing body of work. Fifty-five peer-reviewed studies were analyzed and categorized into six key implication areas: emotional well-being, stress reduction, cognitive performance, attention recovery, restorative benefits, and nature connectedness. The review identifies immersive virtual nature as a promising application of extended reality (XR) technologies, with potential across healthcare, education, and daily life, while also emphasizing the need for more consistent methodologies and long-term research.},

Avagents can interpret meeting context and generate appropriate responses to questions posed by asynchronous viewers. Through a user study (N =30), we evaluated Avagents against a traditional playback method and a voice-based AI assistant across two asynchronous meeting scenarios: analytic reasoning and affective resonance. Results showed that Avagents enhance the asynchronous communication experience by increasing social presence, sense of belonging, emotional intimacy, and other user perceptions.

Traditional teaching methods often struggle to convey abstract concepts in science, where many phenomena are not directly observable. VR can address this issue by modeling and visualizing complex and unobservable entities and processes, allowing learners to dynamically interact with what would otherwise not be directly perceptible. However, relatively few controlled studies have compared immersive VR learning with equivalent hands-on laboratory learning in physics education, particularly for more abstract topics. In this work, we designed a VR-based physics lab that is capable of visualizing electrons and electromagnetic fields to teach fundamental concepts of electronics and magnetism, closely replicating a traditional electronics learning kit used as a baseline for comparison. We evaluated the impact of the two conditions (VR versus traditional) on students' learning outcomes, motivation, engagement, and cognitive load. Our results show significantly higher knowledge retention in the VR group compared to the traditional group. Also, while there were no significant differences in immediate comprehension between the two groups, participants in the VR group spent substantially more time engaged with the learning content. These findings highlight the potential of visually enriched virtual environments to enhance the learning experience and improve knowledge retention of intangible scientific concepts.},

Traditionally, AI voice assistants are activated through wake-up keywords, and since they are invisible, their method of appearance has not been a concern. However, for ECAs in AR, the question of how they should enter the user's space when summoned remains underexplored. In this paper, we focused on the plausibility of ECAs' entering action into the user's field of view in AR. We analyzed its impact on user experience, concentrating on perceived social presence and co-presence of the agent. Three entrance styles were chosen for comparison: an obviously impossible one, a possible one, and an intermediate one, alongside a voice-only condition. We designed and conducted a within-subjects study with 38 participants. Our results indicated that while the plausibility of the action had less impact on functionality compared to the embodiment itself, it significantly affected social/co-presence.

Our approach introduces affective visual cues including line shape, motion, and color applied to hand outlines, and examines their influence on both affective responses (arousal, valence) and perceived roughness. Results show that sharp contours enhanced perceived roughness, increased arousal, and reduced valence, intensifying the emotional impact of haptic feedback. In contrast, color affected valence only, with red consistently lowering emotional positivity. These effects were especially noticeable at lower haptic intensities, where visual cues extended affective modulation into mid-level perceptual ranges. Overall, the findings highlight how integrating expressive visual cues with tactile feedback can enrich affective rendering and offer flexible emotional tuning in immersive VR interactions.},

  abstract     = {Head-worn augmented reality (AR) continues to evolve through critical advancements in power optimizations, AI capabilities, and naturalistic user interactions. Eye-tracking sensors play a key role in these advancements. At the same time, eye-tracking data is not well understood by users and can reveal sensitive information. Our work contributes visualizations based on visceral notice to increase privacy awareness of eye-tracking data in AR. We also evaluated user perceptions towards privacy noise mechanisms applied to gaze data visualized through these visceral interfaces. While privacy mechanisms have been evaluated against privacy attacks, we are the first to evaluate them subjectively and understand their influence on data-sharing attitudes. Despite our participants being highly concerned with eye-tracking privacy risks, we found 47% of our participants still felt comfortable sharing raw data. When applying privacy noise, 70% to 76% felt comfortable sharing their gaze data for the Weighted Smoothing and Gaussian Noise privacy mechanisms, respectively. This implies that participants are still willing to share raw gaze data even though overall data-sharing sentiments decreased after experiencing the visceral interfaces and privacy mechanisms. Our work implies that increased access and understanding of privacy mechanisms are critical for gaze-based AR applications; further research is needed to develop visualizations and experiences that relay additional information about how raw gaze data can be used for sensitive inferences, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. We intend to open-source our codebase to provide AR developers and platforms with the ability to better inform users about privacy concerns and provide access to privacy mechanisms.

We present Ada, the first open distributed, power-aware, application-agnostic real-time scene provisioning system. Through computation offloading along with algorithmic and system innovations, Ada provides high-fidelity scenes with stable performance across all evaluated scene sizes and with low power consumption. To isolate the benefits of Ada's algorithmic and design innovations over the closest prior work [82], which is on-device and CPU-based, we configure a comparable on-device, CPU-based variant of Ada (AdaLocal- CPU). We show this variant achieves up to 6.8× lower scene request latency and higher scene fidelity compared to the prior work. Furthermore, Ada's final distributed GPU-accelerated implementation reduces latency by an additional 2×, highlighting the benefits of GPU acceleration and distributed computing. Additionally, Ada also lowers the incremental power cost of scene provisioning by 24% compared to the best on-device variant (AdaLocal-GPU). Finally, Ada flexibly adapts to diverse latency, power, scene fidelity, and network bandwidth requirements.},

For this, we implemented video-see-through (VST) AR-based virtual building blocks and hot wire tasks with real one-to-one counterparts that require participants to use gross and fine motor hand movements. To evaluate manipulation performance, we considered three measures: task completion time, number of collisions (hot wire task), and percentage of object displacement (building block task). Additionally, we explored the sense of agency and subjective impressions (preference, ease of interaction, successful and awkwardness) evoked by the different hand-visualizations. The results show that (1) manipulation performance is significantly higher when interacting with real objects compared to virtual ones, (2) invisible hands lead to fewer errors, higher agency, higher perceived success and ease of interaction during fine manipulation tasks with real objects, and (3) having some visualization of the virtual hands (transparent or opaque) overlayed on the real hands is preferred when manipulating virtual objects even when there are no significant performance improvements.

  abstract     = {We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GSProCams is not only view-agnostic but also significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional co-located light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the projection surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and the global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It also uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory for training and is 900 times faster in inference speed.

  abstract     = {In educators' ongoing pursuit of enriching remote education, Virtual Reality (VR)-based telepresence has shown significant promise due to its immersive and interactive nature. Existing approaches often rely on point cloud or NeRF-based techniques to deliver realistic representations of teachers and classrooms to remote students. However, achieving low latency is non-trivial, and maintaining high-fidelity rendering under such constraints poses an even greater challenge. This paper introduces LiteAT, a data-lightweight and user-adaptive VR telepresence system, to enable real-time, immersive learning experiences. LiteAT employs a Gaussian Splatting-based reconstruction pipeline that integrates an SMPL-X–driven dynamic human model with a static classroom, supporting lightweight data transmission and high-quality rendering. To enable efficient and personalized exploration in the virtual classroom, we propose a user-adaptive viewpoint recommendation framework that dynamically suggests high-quality viewpoints tailored to user preferences.

  abstract     = {When communicating with embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in virtual reality, there might be delays in the responses of the agents lasting several seconds, for example, due to more extensive computations of the answers when large language models are used. Such delays might lead to unnatural or frustrating interactions. In this paper, we investigate filler types to mitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of the agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate with ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the delays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and gestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic indicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other one external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the behavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of presence, humanlikeness, and naturalness. Participants looked away from the face more often when symbolic indicators were displayed, but the visualizations did not lead to a more positive impression of the agent or to increased presence. The majority of participants preferred the behavioral fillers, only 12.5% and 4.2% favored the symbolic embedded and external conditions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in eye-tracking technology have positioned gaze as an efficient and intuitive input method for Virtual Reality (VR), offering a natural and immersive user experience. As a result, gaze input is now leveraged for fundamental interaction tasks such as selection, manipulation, crossing, and steering. Although several studies have modeled user steering performance across various path characteristics and input methods, our understanding of gaze-based steering in VR remains limited. This gap persists because the unique qualities of eye movements—involving rapid, continuous motions—and the variability in eye-tracking make findings from other input modalities nontransferable to a gaze-based context, underscoring the need for a dedicated investigation into gaze-based steering behaviors and performance. To bridge this gap, we present two user studies to explore and model gaze-based steering. In the first one, user behavior data are collected across various path characteristics and eye-tracking conditions. Based on this data, we propose four refined models that extend the classic Steering Law to predict users' movement time in gaze-based steering tasks, explicitly incorporating the impact of tracking quality. The best-performing model achieves an adjusted R2 of 0.956, corresponding to a 16% improvement in movement time prediction. This model also yields a substantial reduction in AIC (from 1550 to 1132) and BIC (from 1555 to 1142), highlighting improved model quality and better balance between goodness of fit and model complexity. Finally, data from a second study with varied settings, such as a different eye-tracking sampling rate, illustrate the strong robustness and predictability of our models. Finally, we present scenarios and applications that demonstrate how our models can be used to design enhanced gaze-based interactions in VR systems.},

Depth-based object exploration is a common but underexplored task in XR environments, especially in settings without physical devices. Prior studies have largely focused on horizontal or planar interactions, leaving depthoriented exploration relatively overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose three linearly aligned layer transition techniques (Continuous Push, Push&Return, and Tilt&Return) specifically designed to support efficient, precise, and continuous object exploration along the depth axis within depth-based UIs. In a user study with 30 participants, we compared their performance, usability, and user preference across two different layer configurations (8-layer vs. 16-layer). The results highlight that Continuous Push enables faster exploration with lower effort, while Push&Return provides the highest accuracy and is most preferred by users. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for depth-based interaction techniques in controller-free XR environments.},

This task fundamentally involves sensemaking—interpreting complex, scattered information sources to build understanding. While emerging immersive analytics tools have shown cognitive benefits like enhanced spatial memory and reduced mental load, they predominantly focus on information synthesis (e.g., organizing known documents). In contrast, the equally important information foraging phase—discovering and gathering relevant literature—remains underexplored within immersive environments, hindering a complete sensemaking workflow. To bridge this gap, we introduce LITFORAGER, an interactive literature exploration tool designed to facilitate information foraging of research literature within an immersive sensemaking workflow using network-based visualizations and multimodal interactions. Developed with WebXR and informed by a formative study with researchers, LITFORAGER supports exploration guidance, spatial organization, and seamless transition through a 3D literature network. An observational user study with 15 researchers demonstrated LITFORAGER's effectiveness in supporting fluid foraging strategies and spatial sensemaking through its multimodal interface.},

While numerous studies have explored the effects of several virtual characters' properties, the impacts of the virtual character's personality and age on human perceptions and experiences have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we conducted a within-group study (N = 28) following a 2 (personality: egoism vs. altruism) × 2 (age: child vs. adult) design to explore how the personality and age factors influence human perception and experience during interactions with virtual characters. In each condition of our study, our participants co-solved a jigsaw puzzle with a virtual character that embodied combinations of personality and age. After each condition, participants completed a survey. We also asked them to provide written feedback at the end of the study. Our statistical analyses revealed that the virtual character's personality and age significantly influenced participants' perceptions and experiences. The personality factor affected perceptions of altruism, anthropomorphism, likability, safety, and all aspects of user experience, including perceived collaboration, rapport, emotional reactivity, and the desire for future interaction. Additionally, the virtual character's age affected our participants' ratings of the uncanny valley and likability. We also identified an interaction effect between personality and age factors on the virtual character's anthropomorphism. Based on our findings, we offered guidelines and insights for researchers aiming to design collaborative experiences with virtual characters of different personalities and ages.},

  abstract     = {An optical-see-through near-eye display (NED) for augmented reality (AR) allows the user to perceive virtual and real imagery simultaneously. Existing technologies for optical-see-through AR NEDs involve trade-offs between key metrics such as field of view (FOV), eyebox size, form factor, etc. We have enhanced an existing compact wide-FOV pinlight AR NED design with real-time 3D pupil localization in order to dynamically steer and thus effectively enlarge the usable eyebox. This is achieved with a dual-camera rig that captures stereoscopic views of the pupils. The 3D pupil location is used to dynamically calculate a display pattern that spatio-temporally modulates the light entering the wearer's eyes. We have built a demonstrable compact prototype and have conducted a user study that indicates the effectiveness of our eyebox steering method (e.g., without eyebox steering, in 10.5% of our tests, users were unable to perceive the test pattern correctly before experiment timeout; with eyebox steering, that fraction decreased dramatically to 1.25%). This is a small yet crucial step in making simple wide-FOV pinlight NEDs usable for human users and not just as demonstration prototypes filmed with a precisely positioned camera standing in for the user's eye. Further contributions of this paper include a detailed description of display design, calibration technique, and user study design, all of which may benefit other NED research.},

The results show that the light field AR glasses led to a significantly faster reaction speed and higher accuracy than the conventional AR glasses at 30 cm in the AR mode. The participant feedback also shows that the former led to better virtual-real integration. User performance and experience of the light field AR glasses remained consistent across different viewing distances. Although the conventional AR glasses had a better search efficiency than the light field AR glasses at 60 cm in both AR and VR modes, it had more negative feedback from the participants. Overall, the design of this experiment successfully allows us to quantify the effect of VAC and underscores the strength of the evaluation method},

The application simulates the lifecycle of Ascaris lumbricoides and corresponding immunological mechanisms across anatomically accurate environments within the human body. Integrating serious game mechanics with embodied learning principles, MetaRoundWorm offers players a task-driven experience combining exploration, puzzle-solving, and immune system simulation. To evaluate the educational efficacy and user engagement, we conducted a controlled study comparing MetaRoundWorm against a traditional approach, i.e., interactive slides. Results indicate that MetaRoundWorm significantly improves immediate learning outcomes, cognitive engagement, and emotional experience, while maintaining knowledge retention over time.
