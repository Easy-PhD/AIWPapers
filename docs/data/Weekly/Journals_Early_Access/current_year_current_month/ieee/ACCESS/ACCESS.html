This study proposes ŶUGO model, a novel two-stage hybrid model that integrates Gradient Boosting (GB) for non-linear workload forecasting and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for final power prediction, leveraging proxy metrics from hypervisor loads via SNMP. Through extensive experimentation, ŶUGO model demonstrates superior accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.46 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.50 in multi-step-ahead forecasting. Crucially, this performance represents a significant MAE reduction of up to 86.42% compared to the ARIMA model and substantial improvements over MLP and SVR benchmarks. The proposed framework offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for precise energy monitoring without requiring physical sensors, providing a practical tool for enhanced resource management in virtualized environments.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an accurate and efficient approach to fitness activity recognition by combining inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data with deep learning techniques. We propose a novel architecture, 1D-CNN-ResBiGRU, which integrates one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with residual bidirectional gated recurrent units (ResBiGRUs) for temporal sequence modeling, enabling precise classification of diverse fitness activities. The ResBiGRU introduces residual connections within the bidirectional gated recurrent units, not just between layers. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated using the publicly available Running Exercise dataset, which comprises IMU recordings from 20 participants performing seven distinct running exercises. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent mobile fitness applications that provide personalized, responsive exercise feedback and performance monitoring.},

  abstract     = {As smart energy hubs (SEHs) evolve with the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their dynamic charging and discharging processes, they become increasingly susceptible to advanced cyberattacks, especially those targeting electrical and thermal demands. These attacks pose significant risks to integrated systems, including charging stations, vehicle-to-home (V2H) interfaces, and energy storage systems (ESS) comprising batteries for EVs and thermal storage (TS). The analysis focuses on how SEHs respond when subjected to stealthy data manipulation threats that evade detection, which exploit weaknesses in electrical and thermal loads to bypass conventional detection mechanisms and disrupt operational stability. To mitigate these threats, a robust machine learning (ML) framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed. This approach reconstructs compromised load data, restoring system integrity and enhancing resilience. Test scenarios demonstrate that tampered inputs may cause electrical consumption to vary by nearly 17% and thermal usage by approximately 25%, severely impacting SEH stability. Following the deployment of the defense mechanism, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is significantly reduced to 11.96% for electrical demand and 2.33% for thermal demand. The proposed RL-based strategy effectively enhances energy storage systems’ resilience against cyber threats, addressing key vulnerabilities and ensuring stable operations in smart grid ecosystems.},

The HPUC topology generates a high number of voltage levels with minimal components but presents control challenges due to its numerous switching states and dynamic charging behavior. Unlike conventional control methods, which require accurate models and are sensitive to noise and parameter mismatches, DRL offers a model-free and resilient approach to the non-linear control of such complex systems. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent which is inherently model-free and suited for high-dimensional state spaces and discrete action spaces, is employed to address these issues. To validate the proposed method, simulations were conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed DRL method, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 2.71% in the output current under steady-state, maintaining stable capacitor voltage balancing, and exhibiting rapid dynamic response (e.g., settling within approximately 40 ms for current step changes). Furthermore, its resilience was highlighted by its ability to maintain control despite a 25dB SNR noise condition and up to 15% variations in capacitor values.},

  abstract     = {Biometics such as fingerprint, face, and iris are vulnerable to spoof attacks. The unique characteristics of Electroencephalography (EEG) make it a promising biometric modality especially because of its resistance to spoofing attacks. Many deep learning methods have been proposed for EEG-based biometric systems. This systematic review examines these methods in terms of their feature extraction ability and authentication performance. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search IEEE Xplore, PubMed,Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Springer databases. Initially, we identified 285 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2024. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 of them were selected and investigated thoroughly. This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.},

Traditional assembly line operations often rely heavily on manual labor, resulting in inconsistent performance and elevated error rates. Although conventional automated systems can reduce human intervention to some extent, they frequently lack the flexibility and precision required for handling complex component assembly tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced image analysis techniques to optimize assembly line performance. By leveraging state-of-the-art image processing algorithms, the proposed method enables real-time detection and precise manipulation of components during the assembly process. The system employs a combination of deep learning models for robust object recognition and spatial analysis, ensuring high accuracy in component placement and effective defect detection. The method demonstrates strong adaptability, allowing it to adjust dynamically to various assembly scenarios and production requirements, thereby expanding its applicability across diverse manufacturing workflows. Experimental evaluations reveal a substantial increase in assembly line throughput, alongside a significant reduction in operational errors compared to traditional systems. Our system achieves a detection precision of 92.4% on MVTec AD and 94.1% on KolektorSDD, while reducing false positive rates by 25% relative to baseline models such as YOLOv5 and FastDefectNet. The system also exhibits excellent robustness under different environmental conditions, further reinforcing its industrial viability.

As advertising companies and web services actively adopt these techniques to deliver personalized content, user tracking activities have grown more prevalent, often without proper consent, thereby intensifying privacy concerns. In response to this evolving landscape, recent studies have explored machine learning-based approaches to detect tracking behaviors by analyzing script characteristics. However, existing techniques face limitations in identifying previously unknown trackers due to their reliance on known filter lists and insufficient training datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel detection method based on data flow analysis using the Hermes JavaScript engine. By analyzing intermediate representation (IR) and applying a script deobfuscation process, the method effectively tracks data flow across stages such as variable assignment, propagation, function calls, and external leakage. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on large-scale web datasets, including high-traffic websites. The results demonstrate the method’s capability to uncover previously undetected tracking activities, offering greater transparency in how behavioral information is collected and shared. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and comprehensive tracking detection frameworks, strengthening user privacy protection in the modern web ecosystem.},

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble learning plays a crucial role in deep learning (DL) by improving classification accuracy through the aggregation of multiple classifiers. However, traditional methods, such as bagging, boosting, and stacking, face limitations when combining heterogeneous classifiers trained on unrelated tasks, owing to their reliance on closely aligned objectives. To address these challenges, we propose Adjusted Exponential Scaling (AES), a novel approach that combines diverse classifiers using probabilistic outputs, such as those generated by the Softmax function. AES eliminates the need to modify DL architectures or interfere with their training processes, thereby significantly reducing computational costs while ensuring compatibility with existing systems.We demonstrate AES scalability in simulations, successfully combining the outputs of up to 40 classifiers while maintaining probabilistic integrity. A formal verification using the Z3 Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver confirmed its accuracy and reliability. AES is designed for simplicity and adaptability, making it particularly well suited for dynamic applications such as deepfake detection and medical diagnostics, where real-time combination is critical. By providing a scalable and computationally efficient solution, AES expands the applicability of ensemble learning and establishes a foundation for future extensions to sequential and binary tasks, further enhancing its versatility in machine learning challenges.},

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

The optimization problem is formulated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) position of ARIS and the transmit power of the system, while ensuring a minimum data rate requirement to meet quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, the EE optimization is solved using Dinkelbach’s iterative algorithm and interior point method.

To tackle this challenge, a novel method for segmenting low-resolution batik patterns (MAR-Net) is proposed, and its potential applications in cultural and creative product design are investigated. Specifically, an adaptive rectangular convolution (ARConv) mechanism is incorporated into the conventional U-Net architecture to effectively capture the intricate and diverse texture features of batik patterns, while the AR-Net network is developed to facilitate improved feature extraction and the integration of local and global information. To further enhance segmentation precision, a mask attention mechanism (MaskAttention) is utilized to strengthen the network’s focus on critical regions, thereby improving detail restoration and pattern segmentation through dynamic adjustment of feature weights. To improve the model’s robustness and discriminative capacity, a composite loss function is formulated, integrating pixel-level cross-entropy loss with instance-contrast-based attention loss to enhance the discriminative power of the feature space. In terms of application, accurately segmented batik patterns are converted into resources for cultural and creative product design, and a digital batik pattern resource library is created, with the potential for incorporating traditional patterns into the AIGC creation process being explored. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAR-Net method not only markedly enhances precision in low-resolution pattern segmentation tasks but also exhibits substantial potential for application in cultural and creative product design, offering a novel solution for the digital preservation and innovative utilization of batik patterns, thereby significantly contributing to the study and preservation of traditional ethnic minority arts.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) plays a pivotal role across diverse sectors—including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and defense—by capturing rich spectral information that enables fine-grained material discrimination. Despite its advantages, the inherently high dimensionality and complexity of hyperspectral data present substantial challenges for reliable anomaly detection. Conventional approaches often fall short when confronted with subtle or context-dependent anomalies, underscoring the need for more advanced methodologies. In this study, we propose the Enhanced Spectral Graph Transformer Network (ESGTN), a novel framework that synergistically combines graph-based modeling, transformer architectures, and hyperbolic space embedding to improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectral anomaly detection. By representing HSIs as graphs, ESGTN effectively models both spatial and spectral relationships. The transformer component, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, adaptively emphasizes salient features, while the incorporation of hyperbolic embeddings provides a compact and distortion-minimized representation of the data’s hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that ESGTN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior precision, recall, and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the model’s robustness and practical applicability across a range of real-world scenarios. Moreover, this work contributes to the growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging, offering a scalable path forward for tackling the complex analytical demands inherent to high-dimensional remote sensing data.},

Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {As the only technology that can support kilometer-level underwater communications, the UnderWater Acoustic Communications (UWAC) suffers from low data rate which is unable to support various emerging marine applications. The recently proposed acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (aRIS) has been considered to have the ability to improve the data rate and the coverage of UWAC systems, since it can control the direction of acoustic signal propagation and realize beamforming. The deployment of aRIS is critical to realize its data rate and coverage enhancement capabilities. However, how to optimize the aRIS deployment in deep-sea long-range scenarios has not been studied. To fill in this gap, a transmission loss (TL) model for aRIS-aided UWAC systems is established in this paper, where the beamforming gain and signal amplification gain of aRIS are characterized. Then, based on the TL model, a deep sound channel axis focusing (DSCAF) deployment architecture is proposed and analyzed for aRIS-aided UWAC systems in deep-sea long-range scenarios. In the proposed architecture, one aRIS each is deployed near the transmitter and receiver at the depth of the deep sound channel axis. By utilizing the beamforming capability of aRISs, the proposed DSCAF deployment architecture can guide acoustic signals into and out of the deep sound channel. This will ensure the transmission is fully concentrated in the deep sound channel, thus reducing the TL and enhancing the coverage in a distant receiving area. The analysis proves that the proposed scheme enjoys asymptotic optimality of TL as the number of aRIS elements increases compared to deploying aRISs at other depths. Simulation results have illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce the TL and improve the spectrum efficiency in a long-distance receiving area.},

Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. Although studies have explored the adaptation of DTs technology for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, significant gaps remain in comprehensive data integration, advanced predictive capabilities, and underutilization of Generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time support, limiting support for caregivers in elderly care. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that integrates diverse real-time physiological data to enhance personalized healthcare. The feasibility and applicability of the framework were validated by developing a cardiac DT incorporating real-time monitoring, prediction, and analysis of heart rate (HR), heart rate zone (HRZ), sleep quality DT model, and SpO2 monitoring DT model. Advanced predictive modeling demonstrated high accuracy, with LSTM achieving a 92% validation accuracy in predicting sleep levels. Bi-LSTM demonstrated robust performance in real-time HR (BPM) prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.2944 and MAE of 0.3410. The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision making and elderly self-management.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by vehicular engine systems has necessitated the development of efficient frameworks for real-time big data processing. Existing solutions such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, have been widely adopted in various domains due to their respective strengths; Hadoop’s distributed storage capabilities and Spark’s in-memory processing efficiency. However, these standalone frameworks present limitations when applied to vehicular systems, particularly in handling real-time analytics, low-latency requirements, and efficient use of network and energy resources. Previous research, including approaches like the one by [1], which combines Spark with Hadoop YARN for remote sensing data, and [2], which investigates parameter tuning for Hadoop and Spark, highlights the difficulties in achieving optimal performance in dynamic environments, particularly when managing varying data loads, noise levels, and non-numeric attributes. This paper introduces a novel Optimized Hybrid Framework that integrates Hadoop’s distributed storage and Spark’s in-memory processing while addressing the limitations of existing hybrid models. Unlike prior approaches, our framework incorporates a dynamic switching mechanism based on business logic, data urgency, and noise levels, providing an adaptive and efficient solution for real-time vehicular big data analytics. Moreover, the framework introduces controlled noise injection strategies and special handling for non-numeric attributes such as decision and driver behavior data, ensuring data integrity in real-world vehicular datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Framework outperforms both Hadoop and Spark in key performance metrics, achieving an execution time of 0.030 seconds, latency of 1.67e-7 seconds/row, and a network load of 55.01%. These results highlight the framework’s ability to optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce energy consumption, making it particularly suitable for predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and adaptive vehicular control systems. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, scalable, and low-latency solution for vehicular big data analytics, addressing the shortcomings of both standalone and hybrid approaches in the automotive manufacturers domain, fleet operators, and researchers for a more effective tool for vehicle health monitoring. The enhanced data processing capabilities facilitate better vehicle maintenance, increase safety, and reduce operational costs, delivering substantial benefits to the broader community through more dependable and efficient transportation solution.},

Although machine learning (ML) algorithms promise better results, existing frameworks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in EEG data, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture of a prediction model that uses resting-state EEG data as input. This architecture synergistically combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), which enables accurate discrimination between poor and good prognosis of moTBI. The BiLSTM component extracts complex features from the EEG signals, while AdaBoost serves as a classifier discriminator, replacing the conventional softmax function to optimize performance. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model achieves impressive under the curve (AUC) performance of 99.51 ± 1.36% and 98.91 ± 2.47% for preprocessed and 98.91 ± 2.47% for unprocessed EEG sequences. Notably, the model outperforms conventional DL architectures and other hybrid models, showing improvements of up to 14.14% over DL-only models and 24.51% over traditional ML approaches.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is a critical challenge in credit scoring, where the dominance of majority class samples reduces predictive performance for minority instances. Traditional methods, such as SMOTE and random undersampling, attempt to rebalance datasets but often introduce synthetic noise or discard valuable data. This paper introduces Augmentation Based on Uncertainty and Difficulty (UDDA), a novel real-data augmentation framework that avoids both synthetic data generation and majority class removal. UDDA leverages a hybrid of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Active Learning (AL) to identify and prioritize real, informative, and difficult-to-classify samples. This approach enhances model robustness while preserving dataset integrity. Experimental evaluation on twenty benchmark imbalanced tabular datasets demonstrates that UDDA outperforms established methods, including SMOTE and undersampling, across key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. UDDA sets a new direction in imbalanced learning by offering a practical, interpretable, and effective solution for improving classification performance in credit scoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Classical Arabic (CA) presents unique and significant challenges for computational syntactic analysis, primarily due to its complex morphosyntax, pervasive ellipsis, flexible word order, and the critical scarcity of comprehensive annotated resources. This paper introduces Noor, a novel multi-stage pipeline framework specifically engineered for robust, high-performance syntactic parsing of CA. The Noor framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a dedicated pre-parsing module (TAQDIR) employing a hybrid rule-based and heuristic approach for explicit ellipsis resolution; (2) parallel dependency (ARC-IIRAB) and constituency (ARC-MAHAL) parsers utilizing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based representations and tailored transition systems; and (3) a synthesis mechanism generating enriched hybrid syntactic representations. A primary contribution of this work is the creation and public release of the Quranic Treebank—the first complete, validated, and fully machine-readable hybrid syntactic resource for the CA, reconstructed and augmented using the Noor framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Noor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CA parsing, with the hybrid parser significantly outperforming previous benchmarks by over 4.6 F1 points on the Extended Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS). The framework is complemented by IIRAB Vis, a novel visualization tool designed to render complex hybrid structures in alignment with traditional Arabic grammatical principles (I'rāb). By providing both a validated SOTAmethodology and a foundational public dataset, this research substantially advances the computational analysis capabilities for CA across Natural Language Processing (NLP), digital humanities, and linguistic studies.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen is being explored in several industrial applications to produce various chemicals products, including ammonia and methanol. However, conventional hydrogen production is associated with harmful emissions and relies heavily on depleting fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have been offered as alternative energy supplies to minimize fossil fuels and ensure lower emission levels, therefore, providing a sustainable energy transition. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT), are gaining wide attention for the production of green hydrogen. This article focuses on the storage of renewable energy generation to enhance the production process of green hydrogen. One of the main obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy is the need for inexpensive, highly efficient energy storage. Integrating renewable energy sources into green hydrogen production stands out as a promising solution to this problem. This work aims to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production by electrolysis from solar PV and wind energies. The implemented methodology is a theoretical model of a caustic electrolyzer connected to a solar PV panel and a wind generator. The study assessed the input/output power of solar and wind energy and calculated the green hydrogen production rate to underline the efficiency of the MPPT controller and renewable-based hydrogen production systems. According to the simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the hydrogen production system performs effectively, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Taking into account the final results, the Wind energy demonstrates superior performance in green hydrogen production, achieving 90% efficiency and a rate of 1.2 Nm³/h, significantly outperforming solar photovoltaics’ 82% efficiency and 0.66 Nm³/h.},

  abstract     = {As urban mobility trends shift toward greater customization and flexibility, selecting between Fixed-Route Transit (FRT) and Demand-Responsive connector (DRC) systems remains a key challenge, particularly in low-density areas. This study develops a dual-perspective service quality model that integrates passenger utility and operator cost to determine the Critical Demand Density (CDD)—the threshold at which switching between FRT and DRT becomes optimal. The model captures core components of travel time (walking, waiting, riding) and operational characteristics. Under non-subsidized conditions, FRT is more suitable in compact, high-demand regions, while DRT better serves decentralized, low-demand areas, with the CDD threshold at approximately 13 passengers/hour/km². Incorporating fiscal subsidies, the model reformulates utility functions to include passenger-based marginal subsidies. Results show that subsidies significantly shift the mode transition threshold, increasing the CDD to 22 passengers/hour/km² and improving DRC’s competitiveness. Sensitivity analyses reveal that factors such as service area geometry, walking time importance, and subsidy magnitude markedly affect CDD values. The model provides a practical, policy-relevant tool for optimizing transit mode decisions based on spatial demand and financial support. This work highlights the strategic role of subsidies in enhancing DRT viability and contributes to sustainable and inclusive urban mobility planning.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

In a field deployment across 12 small-to-medium commercial offices (SMOs) in Fukuoka, Japan (September–November 2024; N=57), the platform was evaluated using a dual-track design. Statistical analysis of hour-level observations across valid workdays (baseline: n = 511; intervention: n = 421) demonstrated substantial energy reduction with large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.72, t(930) = 10.94, p < 0.001), representing a 23.3% decrease in non-HVAC consumption. Targeted evening analysis confirmed intervention effectiveness, with lighting consumption declining 21.4% during notification periods (t = 2.98, p < 0.01, d = 0.51). The action-window analysis isolated user-behavior effects from automated prompts; peak savings of 70.9 Wh were observed within 15 minutes following air-conditioning alerts. The awareness–behavior correlation increased from r = 0.336 (n.s.) to r = 0.634 (p = 0.020), Δr = +0.298. In addition, 69.2% of participants shifted toward more conservation-oriented profiles in a four-quadrant behavioral classification.

To address these challenges, recent studies have integrated cognitive thinking into jamming decision-making, enabling the development of cognitive jamming systems. While prior research has explored jamming decision-making at various stages, a comprehensive, phase-based framework remains underdeveloped. This study bridges this gap by formalizing the mathematical logic of radar jamming and introducing a systematic decision-making framework encompassing four critical dimensions: (1) jamming resource allocation, (2) jamming pattern selection, (3) jamming waveform optimization, and (4) jamming timing determination. Leveraging the proposed framework, we conduct a detailed review and comparative analysis of the existing literature, categorizing approaches into traditional and cognitive jamming decision-making paradigms. We provide a focused review of reinforcement learning-based cognitive jamming decision-making with a systematic analysis of four critical aspects: problem modeling, radar state representation, reward function setting, and algorithmic implementation. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and provide forward-looking insights into the future evolution of radar jamming decision-making.},

Aiming at the problem of inaccurate results of VMETRIC model under low availability, an inventory optimization model of repairable parts of any level and any tier based on the process of generation and destruction is established. By predicting the demand rate and arrival rate of each level of station and each type of spare parts, it builds a model of the birth and death process of each part, and proposes a method of calculating the equipment availability based on the birth and death process. Taking the equipment availability of the whole security system as the constraint index and the lowest total purchase cost of spare parts as the goal, the optimal spare parts allocation plan is obtained by using the marginal algorithm, and a simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimized plan. The simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimization scheme. Combined with the example, the simulation results are used as the test standard, and the authoritative VMETRIC software is selected to compare and illustrate with the analytical model in terms of optimization performance, calculation accuracy and applicability. The results show that both the analytical model and the VMETRIC software have a certain scope of application, and the combination of analytical model and simulation is undoubtedly more adaptable.},

The proposed approach involves analyzing multiple parameters such as the voltage and phase angle difference between bus, critical clearing time (CCT) of the systems, power surge of connected generators in the system, secondary arc duration in the systems, fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomenon, and transient recovery voltage (TRV) in circuit breaker. Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes.

However, this data-driven interconnectivity exposes manufacturing to sophisticated cyber-attacks, one of the well-known attack is a backdoor that silently impairs AI systems. Traditional defence mechanisms are often rigid and not tailored to the unique requirements of Industry 4.0. To address this, we introduce CyberGuard, a novel Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework designed specifically for detecting backdoor attacks in smart manufacturing environments. Unlike methods focusing on direct attack recognition, proposed CyberGuard models normal system behavior and identifies deviations as potential threats. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer AutoEncoder (TAE) to detect anomalies within feature maps. Further, extensive testing on multiple datasets confirms CyberGuard’s capability to detect subtle yet crucial irregularities. We have conducted a comprehensive experiment against multiple backdoor attacks and compared and evaluated CyberGuard with Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Active Clustering, and Spectral Signature. In addition, an additional experiment is also conducted by employing a T-test statistical analysis to demonstrate the significant differentiation between normal and compromised feature maps, thereby validating CyberGuard effectiveness without prior distribution knowledge of the attacks. The results demonstrate that CyberGuard significantly outperformed traditional defences by achieving approximate 100% detection with high F1-score compared to existing defences.},

To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.},

  abstract     = {According to the World Health Organization, approximately 16% of the global population lives with some form of disability—be it physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychosocial. Individuals with disabilities face numerous challenges related to mobility, communication, access to education, and other essential aspects of daily life. In this context, robotic technologies have emerged as innovative solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for people with disabilities, particularly through physical and social assistance. This study presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on robotic technologies developed to support individuals with disabilities. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in major scientific databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. An initial pool of 6290 articles was identified, from which 89 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The results were categorized into five main themes: (a) publication trends and geographical distribution of research, (b) types of robotic technologies and their specific applications, (c) research focus and methodological characteristics, (d) participant demographics and clinical contexts, and (e) key contributions of the included studies. In the discussion, we assess the current impact of robotic technologies on the lives of people with disabilities and highlight areas for future research. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the state of the art in assistive robotics and identifies key directions for technological and scientific advancement in the field.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how the placement of key power electronic components within building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems influences their thermal behavior and long-term reliability, focusing on lifetime estimations of the IGBT switches in both inverters and optimisers. A building physics model including the BIPV system was incorporated and integrated within the power electronics device models. This joint model assesses the impact of surrounding conditions on power inverters and optimisers and explores various practical placement scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted under different environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of airflow rates, BIPV ventilation cavity opening dimensions, and radiation-convection ratios on the system’s thermal behavior. Results indicate that proper placement strategies with sufficient airflow can significantly enhance cooling, reduce thermal stress, and improve the lifetime of the IGBT. This is particularly evident in the case of the inverter, where the DC IGBT (IGBT in the DC-DC converter stage) located in an isolated ceiling has a reduced lifetime of 9.8 % compared to an inverter placed in a utility room. This work provides valuable insights for the design and optimisation of BIPV systems in real-world applications, aiming to improve the operational lifespan of the systems.},

Similarly, the hybrid model of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU also delivers excellent performance by achieving an average accuracy of 94.88%, in calculating the minimum cost for all possible combinations of task offloading in MEC.

  abstract     = {Accurate building footprint extraction from high-resolution imagery is essential for rural infrastructure planning, disaster response, and supporting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {To address electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure concerns and enhance network performance, this work proposes an energy efficiency (EE) optimization algorithm for 5G networks operating in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted environments, considering both power and EMF exposure constraints. The algorithm tackles the challenge of maximizing a constrained EE utility function in multi-active RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by introducing a joint transmit and reflect beamforming approach. Specifically, EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming weights and RIS reflection coefficients under stringent power and EMF exposure limitations. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, a novel algorithm is developed to decouple the optimization variables, with its convergence behavior thoroughly validated. A quadratic transform technique is utilized, introducing a coverage identifier vector to recast the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems solvable using the CVX toolbox. Simulation results demonstrate that integrating RIS significantly boosts energy efficiency, with the performance gap between RIS-assisted and non-RIS scenarios widening over iterations, ultimately achieving a 31.7% improvement compared to systems without RIS. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving 3.3% and 4.8% higher EE than the Truncated and Boosted beamforming (TBBF) and Equalized beamforming (EBF) techniques, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The interconnection of smart medical devices is becoming an important trend in healthcare. As the demand for health monitoring continues to grow, the battery run time on which these devices primarily rely is challenged. Due to the differences in task requirements and power reserves of smart medical device clusters, if some devices run out of energy prematurely, it may lead to a decrease in the performance and reliability of the whole system, which makes it particularly important to globally optimize the battery run time state of smart medical device clusters. This paper proposes a task migration strategy for the battery run time collaborative optimization of smart medical device clusters. Firstly, a feature factor of device run time is proposed to evaluate the difference in the distribution of remaining power and pending tasks in the device cluster. Secondly, each device regulates the local scheduling according to the feature factor, so the dominant device reserves more free time for task migration. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy is proposed, where a graph neural network embeds graph features on the feature factor and its associated device features and sub-task features. The task migration actions are selected based on the graph features for collaborative optimization of battery run time for smart medical device clusters. Validated in the distributed medical device lithium-ion battery drive hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform, the results show that in the cluster with balanced battery run time, the proposed method effectively extends the overall battery run time of the cluster by up to 4.35%. In the cluster with unbalanced battery run time, the proposed method can effectively extend the battery run time of the cluster by more than 19.5%.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. To detect active lesions in this disease, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These materials can have side effects for the patient after several injections. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning methods to detect active lesions in MRI images without using contrast agents. Our data included 9097 lesions from 130 patients from four different imaging centers. First, the lesions were identified, and each one was separated from the images as a patch. Texture features were also calculated for each lesion. Then, the study was conducted based on the input type in three different phases, including image intensity, texture features, and the combination of image intensity and texture features. In each phase, a proper CNN network was designed. In addition, 13 pre-trained CNN networks were also applied to predict lesions in the third phase. The ensemble technique was another method used in this phase to categorize lesions. Additionally, inter-center variability and cross-center generalizability assessment analyses were conducted to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. The statistical results for the designed network of the first phase were obtained as an accuracy value of 85%, specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 74%, and AUC of 0.90. These values for the second phase were 77%, 90%, 63%, and 0.85, respectively, and for the third phase, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 0.94, respectively. Among the pre-trained networks in the third phase, the EfficientNetV2M showed the best performance with an average accuracy of 88%, specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 86%, and AUC of 0.92.

This study presents a hybrid extractive QA model tailored for Kazakh, a morphologically complex and digitally underrepresented language, by integrating dense retrieval mechanisms with ontology-based semantic prefixing mechanism. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on retrieval and reading comprehension, our architecture injects dynamically constructed semantic definitions for domain-specific terms into the answer context, enabling more profound understanding and improved accuracy. Leveraging a novel dataset of Kazakh QA pairs generated through GPT-4 with expert validation, we introduce a dual-stream hybrid model (Hybrid B) that combines ontology-driven enrichment with fine-tuned transformer models for the retriever and reader components. The proposed system achieves a significant leap in performance, with 88% F1 and 76% exact match scores, substantially outperforming established baselines, including KazQAD. By anchoring the QA pipeline in a custom-built educational ontology relevant to the target domain, this research demonstrates how semantic structure can compensate for linguistic and data scarcity, paving the way for scalable QA systems in other low-resource languages such as Turkish. Beyond its empirical results, the study contributes a reproducible and modular framework for retrieval-augmented, ontology-aware QA, with implications for educational platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, and domain-specific information access.

By directly inferring patient similarities from data, IPFL enables personalized model training without requiring assumptions about cluster structures or interpolation with a global model. We validate IPFL on two real-world healthcare tasks: epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia detection, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning systems (IPS) play a vital role in applications such as navigation and asset tracking. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms on a newly introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) dataset, specifically developed for localization tasks. The dataset undergoes systematic robustness testing, including RSSI masking, added noise, and missing anchor nodes, to assess model resilience in challenging conditions. Five machine learning algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—are examined to benchmark their performance. The models are evaluated based on localization error (LE) and success rate (SR) across different accuracy thresholds, utilizing a custom dataset collected in diverse room environments. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that XGBoost and RF achieve superior accuracy and scalability compared to other methods. RF delivers strong localization accuracy with low computational overhead, while XGBoost balances high accuracy with robustness to environmental noise and partial data loss. However, challenges such as performance inconsistencies in rooms with poor signal coverage and susceptibility to signal fluctuations are noted. These findings establish a benchmark for BLE RSSI-based localization research, offering key insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning models for various real-world applications. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance.},

  abstract     = {The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for ‘‘usefulness’’, an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.},

Traditional methods exhibit low accuracy and a limited bandwidth range when confronted with conditions characterized by large bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of jamming signals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a signal bandwidth estimation algorithm based on skip connection and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) augmented mask region-convolutional neural network (SLA-Mask). The proposed SLA-Mask progressively implements skip connections in the backbone and employs a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LARS optimization strategy during training. The skip connection framework adopts a dual-path design: a feature rebuilding module with two-stage discrete wavelet transform (DWT) enhancement and a dynamic attention gated fusion (DAGF) based fusion module. This architecture can achieve accurate jamming signal detection, segmentation, and bandwidth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-Mask achieves accurate bandwidth estimation and effectively mitigates feature degradation and and oscillations during the period of large-scale training. At SNR=-10 dB, it improves the estimation accuracy by 98.7% compared with the traditional auto-correlation function (ACF) based method.},

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) offer high torque density. However, they are expensive owing to the rising prices of rare earth elements used in permanent magnets (PMs). This study proposes a double-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (DF-IPMSM) that achieves equivalent output torque and reduced torque ripple, while minimizing PM usage. It achieves flux concentration using C-type ferrite PMs arranged in a flared configuration and enhances reluctance torque by increasing the difference between Ld and Lq using a double-layer PM arrangement. Finite element analysis (FEA) under rated load and drive conditions demonstrates that the DF-IPMSM achieves output torque and efficiency equivalent to those of a single-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (SF-IPMSM) despite the reduced PM usage. To verify the structural advantages of the DF-IPMSM, it was compared with three alternatives, namely, SF-IPMSM, double-bar type IPMSM (DB-IPMSM), and double-spoke type IPMSM (DS-IPMSM), under rated load conditions. The FEA results indicated that the DF-IPMSM achieves the highest reluctance torque at equivalent output torque and efficiency. Although DF-IPMSM utilizes the reluctance torque more effectively than SF-IPMSM, it has the disadvantage of increasing torque ripple due to magnetic saturation and harmonic distortion. We performed an optimization rotor geometry design to improve this drawback. Sample points were generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and constructed a Kriging-based surrogate model. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal values for minimizing torque ripple. Finally, the FEA results of the optimized model were compared with the prototype measurements to verify the validity of the proposed DF-IPMSM. The proposed DF-IPMSM design offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional IPMSMs by significantly reducing reliance on rare earth PMs while maintaining high torque performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics aims to verify the authenticity of an image by determining its origin and any processing it has undergone. Among passive approaches in copy move forgery detection, which analyze images without requiring prior embedded information, a region of interest in an image is duplicated and manipulated to conceal or alter content. This process often involves multiple transformations that significantly alter the image. These transformations consist of several operations such as geometrical transformations, frequency domain transformations, noise addition, etc. In copy-move forgery detection, conventional approaches are generally effective at identifying simple copy-move forgeries. However, these approaches often fall short in detecting copy-move forgeries when frequency domain transformations are applied to the copied regions. Further, existing approaches have a high false positive rate in terms of detecting natural similarity. The proposed method introduces an advanced deep learning approach for detecting copy-move forgeries in frequency domains. During preprocessing, segmentation is utilized to extract the objects or regions of interest in the image. DenseNet121 is employed to extract high-level feature from these segmented regions with a detailed analysis of features from each block. By comparing the features extracted from block 4, the method identifies and maps regions with similar features, thereby detecting potential transformed copy move manipulations. This proposed method demonstrates robustness in identifying forgeries that involve transformations and significantly enhances detection accuracy with natural similarity.},

  abstract     = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) typically relies on strongly labeled data that specify when, where, and which sounds occur, resulting in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we present a framework that enables SELD training without spatial labels, termed spatial annotation-free SELD. The core idea is to reinterpret source localization—traditionally handled as a regression problem—as a classification task called spatial instance classification (SIC). SIC first partitions the observation region into sub-regions. For each sub-region, the acoustic signal capturing its sound events is extracted as a spatial instance. Classifying these instances reveals the sub-regions that contain sound events, thereby providing SELD functionality. By solving SIC under weak supervision, we realize spatial annotation-free SELD. SIC does not depend on a specific microphone configuration, and it is expected to be generally applicable as long as the sound in each divided region can be extracted as an instance. We validate the generality of SIC through two contrasting experiments: (i) application to SELD using first-order ambisonics (FOA), and (ii) application to a newly introduced distributed SELD task, where events are localized on a 2D plane using widely spaced microphones. In both settings, SIC effectively trains SELD systems capable of localizing sound events without spatial annotations. The proposed approach, therefore, facilitates the development of practical, spatial-annotation-free SELD across diverse microphone setups.},

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) techniques present solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address class imbalance and data scarcity. The current solutions for class imbalance, either random oversampling or random under-sampling techniques, suffer from several issues. For instance, oversampling leads to overfitting due to replication, whilst under-sampling leads to loss of information due to removals. Meanwhile, traditional DA techniques, including paraphrasing, rule-based, or noising approaches, require strong lexicons. These techniques are also either time-consuming or introduce noise, resulting in incorrect syntactical and semantic contexts. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel DA framework for Arabic news articles to address the prevailing challenges in Arabic Multi-Label Text Classification (AMLTC). The proposed framework consists of three phases: abstractive summarization using the Arabic Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (AraBART) model to introduce new features, data generation with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (AraGPT2) to create diverse and contextual texts, and data balancing using borderline Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve an optimal balance. Each phase was evaluated to ensure the quality of the augmented data. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was conducted to assess the performance of the augmented dataset (augDS) on a multi-label Arabic RTN news dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addressed the class imbalance problem by preserving data integrity and significantly improving Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) performance compared to the non-augDS. Specifically, the F1-score increased from 0.54% on the original dataset to 0.90% after augmentation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully addresses the issues in Arabic datasets by generating diverse, novel augmented data. Additionally, it enhanced MLTC performance, showcasing its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

Prosthetic technology, particularly in the realm of socket design, plays a pivotal role in rehabilitation for individuals with limb amputations. Prosthetic sockets, which serve as the critical interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb, enable amputees to walk without the need for invasive implants that connect directly to the bone of the residual limb. This study focuses on the role of intra-socket pressure in socket performance and its impact on optimal socket rectifications for improving comfort in transfemoral amputees. Employing thin Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors, the research measures dynamic pressure variations across individual gait cycles. To explore the effects of altered pressure distribution on socket performance, a clinical trial was conducted consisting of four different socket configurations across several participants, one of which was with no pad inserted and three of which incorporated a silicone pad to modify the dynamic pressure profiles. With data from multiple participants including specific dynamic pressure features extracted from FSR sensors, and subjective feedback of comfort, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained to establish predictive relationships between intra-socket pressure and appropriate rectification action. The findings suggest that the MLP agent is more accurate at suggesting rectification actions to prosthetists when compared to simpler classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression, laying the foundation for future advancements in prosthetic design.},

However, despite the recent uptake, event-based datasets are still rare. This lack of availability of time-event datasets has led to the development of tools such as v2e [1], which can simulate event streams from conventional video. Although these tools are incredibly useful for early stage development and testing, little attention has been paid to how the quality of the source video affects these simulated events. This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the impact of video compression on simulated event streams. We evaluate how lossy compression algorithms affect the accuracy and noise levels of simulated events, revealing that compression artifacts, particularly in darker regions of videos, can produce significant noise in these event streams.We introduce a novel event stream comparison method to determine the fidelity of events simulated from varying video codecs and parameters. Our findings show that compression can severely degrade simulated event quality, and that codec choice and parameters can influence event fidelity significantly. We further benchmark a range of corrective methods, including conventional filters and machine learning-based preprocessing, to mitigate the adverse effects of compression. Although some approaches show some improvements, none fully restore the fidelity of uncompressed video sources. We conclude with practical recommendations for dataset publishers and researchers using event simulation tools, emphasizing the importance of compression-aware practices in dataset preparation and usage.},

However, with the rapid increase in the number of smart terminal devices, authentication generates a large amount of identity information, leading to storage and transmission problems, including large data transmission delays and strained computational capabilities at some nodes. Through the design of lightweight multi-factor authentication method and the terminal side migration of computing resources, this paper proposes a multi-factor authentication method for grid terminal based on the idea of edge computing. It is based on the target recognition technology of the YOLO algorithm and takes the target ’category’ and the target’attitude’ in the detection box as ’ownership-based’ and ’knowledge-based’ authentication factors. Finally, the authentication security and the real-time performance of the mechanism are verified through experiments. Experimental results show that the method achieves 96.3% interception of predefined identity attacks (e.g., brute force, impersonation) and 5.1 times faster authentication compared to traditional multi-factor mechanisms with the same level of security. The method achieves an average authentication delay of 3.63 seconds, balancing real-time performance and security.},

  abstract     = {Urinary incontinence is closely associated with mobility limitations. In understaffed nursing homes, timely toileting support is often lacking, making reliable monitoring of voiding intention essential for reducing dependence and improving the quality of life. This study explores the feasibility of using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify urinary urgency and voiding intentions. Ten participants were recruited, and EEG signals were recorded with a 64-channel EEG device during both non-urgent and urgent states. The SEResNet34 deep learning model, which incorporates ResNet34 and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) components with temporal aggregated pooling (TAP), was proposed, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test set. The result showed that the improved SEResNet34 model can effectively classify EEG signals for urgency, achieving an accuracy of 0.9208, a precision of 0.9130, a recall of 0.9292, and an F1-score of 0.9211. The model outperformed ResNet18; however, the additional increase in layers beyond ResNet34 was not significantly beneficial.

  abstract     = {To address the logistics problems faced by high-end equipment manufacturers in their two-stage supply chain, this study proposes an optimization strategy for material distribution intervals and quantities. The strategy is based on an improved Mayfly algorithm. These problems include difficulties in accurately responding to production demands, high logistics distribution costs, and low material quality. We have established a two-stage collaborative optimization model of material distribution. This model is adapted to production takt time and its intelligent algorithm. Firstly, we construct a two-stage material distribution interval and quantity optimization model. This model incorporates the total logistics cost of the two-stage supply chain as the optimization objective. It uses Just-in-time delivery and delivery time as constraints. It also considers the complexity of multi-supplier proportional supply. The model is built from multi-supplier to the manufacturer’s warehouse and from the manufacturer’s warehouse to the assembly line side, taking into account material quality. Then, based on this model, we propose an improved Mayfly algorithm. This improved algorithm integrates chaotic maps and adaptive inertia weight. These enhancements aim to improve the optimization ability and convergence speed of the Mayfly algorithm. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm. We conduct an example application under different production takt times. The results demonstrate that the developed model and algorithm have competitive performance in addressing the studied problems, achieving significant reductions in material distribution costs.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Neural Network Coding Layer (NNCL) that applies network coding theory to provide structured redundancy and enable reconstruction of lost features, thereby mitigating information loss problems in deep learning models. Unlike existing skip connections or attention mechanisms, NNCL embeds reconstructible redundancy into intermediate features through a learnable coding process, providing an explicit algebraic restoration mechanism for the original features. This design adapts the core principle of network coding—encoding information recoverably across a channel—for application within the computational graph of a neural network. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets validate NNCL’s effectiveness. Even under a more conventional feature erasure rate of 20%, NNCL consistently improved classification accuracy by up to 8.3 percentage points. The model’s robustness becomes even more pronounced under extreme conditions. In a deliberate stress test involving 60% feature erasure—a scenario where baseline model performance collapses—NNCL dramatically boosted accuracy by up to 40.3 percentage points (e.g., from 19.8% to 60.1% on CIFAR-100). The proposed layer is designed to be modular and has been successfully integrated into various modern architectures, including ResNet and EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer, proving its broad applicability.},

Due to the complex and unpredictable physical conditions of highway slopes, effective identification of microseismic signals remains a challenging task. To address this issue, a wavelet-guided hybrid attention intelligent framework for microseismic event recognition is proposed. Initially, a wavelet domain attention-guided filtering module is designed, which maps time-domain signals to the wavelet domain and employs an attention mechanism to filter and extract features from the signals, thereby enhancing noise suppression and robustness. Subsequently, a physical-knowledge-guided loss function composed of Hilbert transform and l2 / l4 norm is designed to optimize the neural network model. Finally, experimental validation is conducted on a dataset of microseismic events from highway slopes. The experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed method reached 96.31%, outperforming comparative methods and demonstrating the potential application of the proposed method in practical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

This paper introduces the KSSD2025, a novel dataset comprising 838 manually annotated axial CT images for kidney stone segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four segmentation models based on modified U-Net architectures: U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and TransU-Net.

All models achieved mean Dice scores above 95%, with modified U-Net reaching 97.06% during cross-validation and modified U-Net3+ showing better generalization to external data. Our results confirm that U-Net-based architectures, when trained on high-quality annotations, can achieve accurate and reliable kidney stone segmentation.

This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, termed ELRC-GI (Enhanced Lesion Recognition and Classification with Grad-CAM Integration), and designed for accurate and interpretable ocular tumor detection. The proposed model integrates VGG19 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks with Grad-CAM-based attention supervision, enabling both high classification accuracy and precise lesion localization. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ELRC-GI incorporates a heatmap-guided loss function that aligns model predictions with interpretable visual explanations, thereby improving clinical trust and diagnostic reliability. We utilize transfer learning by initializing VGG19 and ResNet50 with pre-trained ImageNet weights, freezing the initial layers and fine-tuning the final layers using the RFMiD dataset to adapt the models to the ocular tumor detection task. The model maintains a true positive rate of 96% at a false positive rate of 0.3%, as evidenced by a robust ROC curve. Experimental results on the RFMiD dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELRC-GI, achieving 97% accuracy, 93% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC of 0.98, significantly outperforming baseline CNN models. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model’s capability to highlight tumor regions, even in the presence of overlapping ocular conditions. The ELRC-GI model thus offers a robust, explainable, and clinically viable solution for early ocular tumor detection, setting the stage for broader application in interpretable medical AI.},

  abstract     = {Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is crucial for effective control and monitoring of power grids. However, existing techniques face numerous challenges including compromised measurements from cyber-attacks and the need for real-time operations. Traditional PSSE methods based on weighted least squares are susceptible to outliers and convergence issues, while convex relaxation techniques like semi-definite programming struggle with computational complexity. Recent deep learning approaches for PSSE are data-driven but unaware of the underlying physical constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework called learned block successive convex approximation (LBSCA) to address PSSE amidst hidden adversarial attacks. LBSCA utilizes an efficient block successive convex approximation algorithm that provably converges to a stationary point and can be learned via algorithm unrolling. The resulting deep neural network achieves real-time, end-to-end PSSE in fractions of a millisecond, even when attacks are unobserved and the network topology is incomplete. Evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus system under realistic noise profiles and stealthy directional and sparse injection attacks, LBSCA achieves lower state estimation errors by up to a factor of three than state-of-the-art deep learning baselines and delivers inference speeds up to four orders of magnitude faster than classical optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that model-driven unrolling of robust estimation yields both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency, underscoring its potential in improving real-time power system operation’s efficiency and security.},

Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), and renal failure. Background The objective of this study is to establish an association between retinopathy and CVD, which is driven by shared pathogenic mechanisms including inflammation, microvascular damage, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes and hypertension substantially increase the likelihood of DR and HR, which in turn elevate the risk of developing CVD. Objective This work is to forecast the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing retinal vasculature and associated clinical risk factors in patients with DR and HR.Methods The method involves a quantitative diagnostic approach using morphological and physiological attributes of the retinal vascular system, such as the Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR) and the Cup-to-Disc ratio (CDR), which serve as biomarkers. In addition, systemic risk indicators including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, and alcohol consumption are incorporated. Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to detect DR, HR, and CVD and to quantify their characteristic features.Results The results indicate that early investigations based on the proposed approach can effectively identify patients at high risk, potentially preventing up to 90% of CVD cases when detected during the early stages.Implications This study highlight the potential of retinal imaging, when combined with deep learning, to serve as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early cardiovascular risk prediction in diabetic and hypertensive individuals, enabling timely clinical intervention.},

  abstract     = {Rising foodborne illnesses drive the demand for safer, fresher food, prompting the exploration of non-thermal technologies as alternatives to traditional thermal treatments. Cold plasma, particularly atmospheric pressure plasma jets, offers rapid and low-temperature processing. While APPJ demonstrates advantages over dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) in terms of flexibility and plasma stability, a comprehensive understanding of its application in food microbial decontamination remains limited. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing the factors and techniques influencing APPJ's effectiveness. It provides a critical discussion of the limitations associated with these factors and techniques, outlines future research opportunities, and highlights key challenges for APPJ technology in food treatment. The technical novelty of this review lies in its detailed analysis of APPJ's operational parameters and their impact on decontamination efficacy, providing a rationale for optimized application and targeted research efforts.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently Thoutperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: (i) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, (ii) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and (iii) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.},

These advancements have revolutionized the way production is carried out, leading to the generation of huge amounts of data in a more affordable and accessible manner, which makes it possible for anomalies to be detected. By identifying anomalies in this data, manufacturers can detect potential faults or issues in the production process early. This early detection can help prevent costly downtime, reduce waste, and improve product quality, ultimately leading to better customer satisfaction and profitability. Given the significant potential benefits, we have collected data from a local factory and launched a research initiative to explore how anomaly detection can help small/med-sized manufacturers to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. This paper addresses this challenge for a key production operation in a local manufacturing plant. In particular, sensors were deployed to continuously measure a critical process variable of the equipment for this operation. Using the sensor data, we develop effective and robust algorithms that can effectively extract the normal pattern features and detect anomalies that occurred during the production process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect the anomalies in high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A novel torsion or twist angle measurement sensor, utilizing a flexible silicone rubber material, has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The operation of this sensor relies on the principle of optical polarization, involving two linear optical polarizers placed sequentially with their polarization axes perpendicular to each other. These polarizers are separated by a transparent cylindrical duct structure made from rigid epoxy resin, which efficiently guides the light rays from the source-side polarizer to the detector-side polarizer. Under normal, untwisted conditions, the orthogonal alignment of the polarizers prevents any light transmission. However, when the sensor experiences torsion or twisting around the axis aligned with the direction of light propagation, the relative angle between the polarizers' axes decreases from 90°, allowing a portion of the light to pass through. The intensity of this transmitted optical power, detected by a phototransistor, is directly proportional to the square of the sine of the twist angle, enabling accurate twist angle measurement by monitoring the photocurrent output. A comprehensive analytical model has been developed to precisely correlate the photocurrent with the twist angle, applicable for both narrow and wide spectrum sensing configurations. Validation of this model through experimental measurements across a twist angle range from –90° to +90° demonstrates strong agreement. Furthermore, repeated cyclic twist tests indicate minimal degradation in measurement accuracy, highlighting the sensor's robustness. This sensor structure achieves an effective balance among accuracy, reliability, scalability, and long-term stability, making it particularly suitable for applications involving frequent cyclic twisting.},

However, the current EMTO algorithms often ignore the information of the search behavior, which only exploit individual information or historical performance when estimating task similarity or transferring knowledge. In this paper, we propose a search behavior learning-based multitask optimization (SBLMTO) algorithm to address the challenge. The search behavior similarity (SBS) strategy is first designed to estimate the similarity of tasks based on the search behavior, so as to adaptively adjust the KT frequency. Then, the knowledge archive is introduced to store the useful transferred knowledge, further enhance the KT efficiency. Next, a two-level transferring knowledge learning (TTKL) strategy is proposed to achieve the effective learning from both the search behavior and the knowledge archive. SBLMTO is tested on the widely used multitask test suites CEC2017 and CEC2022, and the experimental results show that SBLMTO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms, showing its superiority.},

First, the coupling model of long-duration interference signals to the MTLs is constructed via the TL equations combined with the analytical solutions of the excitation fields of MTLs. Then, the FDFD method is applied to solve these TL equations, and new FDFD schemes are developed for calculating the currents on the MTLs and their loads. Additionally, a new FDFD-TL matrix equation is formulated. Finally, the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by the OpenMP parallel technique, is employed to rapidly solve this matrix equation, thereby obtaining the current responses on the MTLs and their terminal loads. The advantages of this method include avoiding late-time instability and lengthy computation times associated with time-domain simulations for long-duration signals, while effectively calculating current responses along MTLs without directly modeling the MTL structures. Numerous coupling simulations of ideal transmission lines and actual power lines excited by various long-duration electromagnetic pulses are presented and compared to the results obtained using the method of moments (MoM) and FDTD-TL method, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network reconfiguration stands out as a potent approach for reducing power losses in radial distribution feeders, where losses notably are more those observed in transmission systems. The distribution power losses incurred not only lead to costly operations but also contribute to a compromised voltage profile in electric energy grids. Habitual reconfiguration involves adjusting the form of the distribution grid to minimize electric energy losses, with a focus on the electricity demanded by end-consumers. The existing models predominantly address distribution network reconfiguration without accounting for the different types of load demand linked to points of consumption, each exerting distinct power loss effects in contrast to single-type demands. Despite the imperative load type diversity role, most models neglect this aspect. The limited studies incorporating load type into reconfiguration strategies tend to employ non-linear formulations, introducing complexities. While models with non-linear characteristics may be tackled via metaheuristic techniques, they fall short of guaranteeing optimal solutions. Alternatively, solving such models using solvers for non-linear equations in conventional tools of optimization demands computations that require significant time. To address these challenges, the present article proposes an impressive model for reconfiguring distribution networks that consider different load types. Notably, this model is designed for seamless implementation with linear procedures. Our study’s results demonstrate the exactitude of the introduced model in yielding accurate results for targeted reconfiguration challenges, coupled with the advantage of swift execution suitable for real-time reconfigurations.},

While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labelled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design.

Through extending the Shanker distribution, the SKSD overcomes the deficiencies of the Shanker distribution, particularly in the modeling of advanced behaviors hazard rate functions. The suggested distribution can represent numerous real-world phenomena due to its different increasing and decreasing hazard rate shapes. Crucial statistical properties such as the quantile function, expansion of the density function, ordinary and incomplete moments, and stress-strength reliability are considered. The model parameters are estimated using both classical and Bayesian methods under adaptive Type-II hybrid progressive censoring with random unit removal. Additionally, the Fisher information matrix is used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to estimate Bayesian credible intervals under symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. It is impossible to compare theoretically estimating processes. In order to investigate the behavior of various estimators and enable comparison using some criteria, extensive simulation research is performed. According to empirical results, relative absolute biases and mean squared errors tend to decrease with increasing sample size. The Bayesian estimate approach typically yields more accurate and stable findings than the maximum likelihood estimate. The SKSD’s adaptable features make it competitive for fitting jute fiber data when compared to the other alternatives.},

Our work addresses significant gaps in current research by offering: (1) a comprehensive overview of methods for binary code similarity; (2) a detailed examination of binary code fingerprinting techniques across various scenarios, from malware detection to digital forensics; (3) a systematic review of vulnerability analysis methods, including control flow graphs, taint analysis, and symbolic execution; (4) an assessment of clone detection strategies, such as text-based, token-based, structural, and behavioral approaches; (5) an in-depth study of authorship attribution techniques, with emphasis on malware attribution methods used in real-world cybersecurity cases; and (6) a thorough review of evasion and anti-analysis strategies, along with their countermeasures. In addition to highlighting the strengths and applications of these approaches, the study also identifies limitations in current methods, such as challenges in malware analysis, vulnerability analysis, and authorship attribution.

While traditional economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, and interest rates are commonly used to define these regimes, their delayed release limits real-time applicability. Motivated by the forward-looking nature of markets, we develop two Machine Learning (ML) models: a Neural Network and an Ensemble Learning classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are trained on a ten-year dataset comprising 22 financial instruments, including equity sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETFs), bonds, commodities, and volatility indices. To enhance predictive robustness, the study incorporates extensive feature engineering, such as logarithmic returns, rolling volatilities, and moving averages, alongside dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluation is conducted through K-Fold cross-validation and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that the Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 57% on first predictions, rising to 78% when considering the top-two predicted quads. The Ensemble model outperforms with a 96% accuracy, exhibiting consistent classification across all quadrants. The findings highlight the practical potential of ML models to identify economic cycles using asset return behavior. By treating asset returns as early-warning indicators, the study bridges the gap between market signals and delayed macroeconomic statistics, contributing a novel approach to economic state prediction.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch Gate Time-series Anomaly Detection (PGTAD), a novel, lightweight, unsupervised multivariate time-series (MVTS) anomaly detection algorithm specifically tailored for IoT network traffic. PGTAD is a Gated recurrent units (GRU) autoencoder-based framework that intelligently integrates features from three perspectives—forward sequences, backward sequences, and local patch segments—using a Gate Mechanism (GM). It employs sinusoidal positional encoding for temporal awareness and a patch operation to capture localized patterns. Anomaly detection is achieved via Mahalanobis distance on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments on publicly available IoT network traffic datasets: Edge-IIoTset, CICIoT2023, CICIoMT2024, and CICIoV2024, utilizing both packet-based and flow-based feature perspectives, demonstrated PGTAD's superior performance. Evaluated using various F-score metrics (including point-wise, composite, and affiliation) and inference throughput, PGTAD achieved an average F-score of 0.92 and sustained over 480K packets per second on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB development kit.

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has driven the evolution of modernized nested microgrids, enhancing resilience and flexibility in power distribution systems. Grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters are central to these systems, with GFL units emulating current sources challenged by uncertain grid impedance, and GFM units emulating voltage sources required to adapt to dynamic load variations. Mode transitions introduce instability through multi-loop control interactions. This work presents a comprehensive dynamical stability analysis of GFL and GFM inverters in nested microgrids, supported by advanced control strategies addressing dynamic response limitations, sensor dependencies, filter fluctuations, and controller complexities. An eigenvalue-based framework identifies dominant oscillatory modes, while online adaptation mitigates disturbances to preserve closed-loop performance. Time-evolution modeling of observables enables enhanced real-time monitoring. A blockchain-enabled decentralized framework ensures secure, transparent, and automated stability actions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrate a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.75% under weak-grid conditions compared with 2.73%, 4.76%, 8.40%, and 2.2% for other approaches and 0.3% under grid-impedance variation and <0.3% under nonlinear loading. The proposed controller achieves 0.06% tracking error dynamics and 0.02% steady-state error, outperforming classical methods (0.32–0.87% and 0.17–0.38%, respectively), with a computational time of 29 ms. The blockchain layer, implemented on the Polygon network, achieved a measured throughput of 1,572 transactions/s, an average block time of 2.3 s, and transaction fees below $0.01 USD, enabling rapid, economical, and scalable peer-to-peer stability service execution.},

  abstract     = {As diffusion models rapidly evolve, the need to incorporate manual feedback into their retraining processes has become increasingly urgent. This paper proposes a novel framework, ED3PO, to address this limitation and improve the objectivity and efficiency of image quality assessment in diffusion model retraining. The framework integrates the D3PO diffusion model with eye-tracking-based deep learning to automate the evaluation of image quality. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 200 participants to collect visual attention metrics during paired comparisons of image quality. Seven machine learning models were subsequently trained, with the best-performing Transformer model used to capture the relationship between eye-tracking data and human image quality assessments. The effectiveness of ED3PO retraining was validated through computational metrics and eye-tracking experiments, and it was further applied to four additional domains. By incorporating eye-tracking into the diffusion model retraining process, this study enables the automated assessment of image quality and the generation of higher-quality images. Furthermore, it offers a reference framework and future research directions for applying eye-tracking technology in the development of diffusion models.},

The spatial domain is discretized using the Virtual Element Method, enabling flexible polygonal meshing under a Galerkin framework. For temporal integration, we employ a convolution-based backward Euler scheme aligned with the Grünwald-Letnikov approximation.

Leveraging discrete maximal regularity, we demonstrate unconditional stability and consistency. Numerical experiments confirm convergence in both L2 and H1 norms across varying mesh topologies, underscoring the robustness and applicability of the proposed scheme.},

We introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture enhanced by contrastive learning, which jointly captures absolute and relative aesthetic cues. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset comprising over 5,000 abstract artworks, enriched with aesthetic scores derived from a fusion of crowdsourced evaluations, expert ratings, and predictive proxies. Optimization is performed using a Lookahead-Rectified Adam (RAdam) strategy to ensure fast convergence and generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ViT model outperforms traditional CNN-based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet by margins of up to 20% in R2 score and 15% in MAE. Key performance metrics include an F1 score of 0.87, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10.0, and an R2 score of 0.92. Additional analysis using scatter plots, Taylor diagrams, and violin plots confirms strong alignment with human judgment. The originality of this work lies in its mathematically grounded architecture for abstract aesthetic evaluation, its integration of contrastive loss for relational understanding, and its interpretability pipeline using attention-based visualization.

Similarly, Digital Twin (DT) technology is increasingly recognized as an enabler for future wireless networks. To mitigate the challenges posed by building obstructions or natural disasters that disrupt radio propagation, this work incorporates multiple UAV-RIS to enhance connectivity and improve link quality throughout the network. This paper proposes a Multi-Relay UAV-RIS-assisted DT (MR-UAV-RIS DT) framework, focused on intelligent network rate management to ensure User Fairness (UF) and Load Balancing (LB) in small cell (SC)-based wireless networks. In the proposed system, dual-connectivity user equipments (UEs) are simultaneously connected to both the macrocell (MC) via relay UAV-RIS, and to Small cell-Base stations (SC-BSs), all operating in the mmWave frequency band to deliver high-speed connectivity. To meet UF and LB goals, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly control the active beamforming for both SC-BSs and the MC, as well as the passive beamforming and 3D positions of the UAV-RISs associated with SC-BSs and relay UAV-RIS linked to the MC. Due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem, a DT-based multi-task deep reinforcement learning model (DT-MTDRL) is proposed, built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model not only ensures a fair rate distribution among users and SCs but also delivers superior performance compared to existing benchmark schemes, while maintaining robust and adaptive connectivity in dynamic and challenging environments.},

Building on the advancements in star sensor detection capabilities, this paper proposes utilizing star sensors as dual-purpose sensors to observe space debris while fulfilling their primary task of attitude determination. A scanning circle (SC) model is established to analyze the observation performance of the space debris located in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt region using star sensors. Based on this model, the optimal optical axis installation orientation of star sensors is derived to ensure full coverage of the GEO belt. Taking a star sensor onboard a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite at an altitude of 700 km as an example, it is demonstrated that setting the installation pitch angle at 13.8° and azimuth angle at 21.2° enables approximately full coverage of the GEO belt through 10 days of long-term observation. Furthermore, by expanding the single star sensor SC model, this paper proposes using star sensors onboard distributed satellite platforms to enhance observation efficiency. The results indicate that deploying 5 star sensors on distributed platforms can achieve rapid full-coverage of the GEO belt within 24 hours. The proposed strategy of using star sensors for space debris observation and the SC model not only expand the application of star sensors into the field of space situational awareness but also open up broader commercial prospects.},

In real-world scenarios, however, these conditions are rarely satisfied. Especially when confronted with a limited number of input views and varying illumination conditions, NeRF experiences diminished performance. While some of the previous works have addressed novel view synthesis under unconstrained illumination, their effectiveness still hinges on dense observations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of few-shot NeRF under unconstrained illumination by leveraging illumination-invariant intrinsic components to provide stronger cross-view regularization. To further enhance practicality, we design a lightweight extension that achieves comparable improvements with minimal computational overhead. We also establish new benchmarks featuring diverse viewpoints and illumination conditions, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework consistently improves robustness and synthesis quality in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the high density and heavy weight of space radiation shielding materials limit their development and application in the aerospace field. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel fast optimization algorithm for shielding material combinations by integrating Particle Swarm Optimization - Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Monte Carlo (MC) method, and Back Propagation (BP) prediction model. Among them, the PSO-DE algorithm can be used to search for potential optimal solutions in a vast material parameter space. The MC method can simulate the interaction process between radiation and shielding materials, providing a basis for evaluating shielding effectiveness. The BP model can quickly predict the shielding performance of different material combinations, accelerating the entire optimization process. It was found that under the condition of 15 individuals per generation, different algorithms performed differently.In terms of optimization results, the PSO-DE algorithm achieved the best performance with the shield design, converging to a minimum mass of 25 kg. The Elitist Genetic Algorithm (EGA) significantly improved the results, achieving a minimum mass of over 30 kg. After optimizing the shield design using these algorithms, the total mass of the final solution that met the radiation value constraints was 1,483 kg, a reduction of 17.4174% compared to the initial method. For the BP model constructed, the average deviation percentage (PBIAS) error in predicting sub-annular dose values was controlled within 20%, and the PBIAS error for photon predictions was below 30%. Although the photon error was relatively high due to the incomplete description of the secondary photon generation mechanism, the predicted values were generally higher, effectively describing the decay pattern of photons.This study proposes a new optimization process to achieve precise and rapid optimization of shielding materials, obtain lightweight and efficient shielding solutions, and provide new ideas for the development of aerospace radiation shielding materials.},

This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation.

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

The study followed ethical protocols approved by the Ethics Committees in Colombia and Ecuador to achieve this. Data was collected during therapy sessions, and three research hypotheses were formulated to evaluate the application’s performance. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using SmartPLS, was employed to analyze the relationships between observed emotional responses and the system’s feedback. The results demonstrated that the application accurately identified the targeted emotions in real time, and 94% of participating therapists positively assessed its usefulness in clinical settings. This validation confirms that the software can provide valuable input for therapists, enabling the design of tailored strategies that address the emotional needs of individuals with DS.

  abstract     = {The growing use of IoT devices has increased the demand for secure and efficient encryption. Most traditional algorithms are too complex to be applied in IoT systems due to the limited resources available. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel, lightweight hybrid cipher suitable for IoT applications. Chaotic maps and Cellular Automata (CA) are utilised to enhance the security level of the proposed cypher while maintaining minimal processing demands. The new cipher integrates Tinkerbell and Tent maps into a complex encryption sequence. Additionally, the S-box is generated using a Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM), further strengthening the encryption. This approach achieves strong security, as evidenced by a high NPCR of 99.6053, indicating high sensitivity to small input changes. It also records a high MSE value of 7157.7306, suggesting strong diffusion and scrambling. Furthermore, the key sensitivity achieved was 99.616% having less than 45 MB of memory usage in a Raspberry Pi 4 board with encryption time of 1.22 seconds. These results confirm that the cipher effectively protects IoT data. This lightweight cipher, which offers strong security without excessive power consumption, is ideal for IoT environments. Future work will focus on improving the performance of smaller devices and testing resilience against a broader range of attacks.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading plays a pivotal role in clinical decision-making, where precise staging directly impacts treatment planning and blindness prevention. Inspired by ophthalmologists’ diagnostic reasoning—which systematically integrates local lesion assessment with global pathological pattern analysis while incorporating edge and frequency-domain information for comprehensive image analysis—we propose an innovative hybrid framework. This framework emulates the clinical cognitive process through three synergistic components, constructing a clinically aligned feature hierarchy: (1) A Lightweight Mixed-domain Attention (LMA)-driven biomarker localization module enhances sensitivity to microaneurysms and exudates by learning spatial-channel dependencies while maintaining a lightweight architecture. (2) Frequency Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Blocks integrate multi-scale spatial and frequency domain features, mimicking the human visual process in lesion identification. (3) Vision Transformers model long-range dependencies to analyze lesion distribution patterns and quantify pathological severity, analogous to clinicians’ holistic evaluation. The entire model contains only 10M parameters, effectively bridging the local modeling capacity of convolutional networks with the global reasoning ability of transformers. Experiments on the APTOS-2019 and DDR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a grading accuracy of 89.6% and a QuadraticWeighted Kappa (QWK) of 93.1% on APTOS-2019, as well as a grading accuracy of 85.2% and aQWKof 84.9% on the DDR dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms many recently popular DR diagnosis and classification approaches, validating its excellence in performance.},

  abstract     = {Achieving full autonomy in robotics requires safe navigation and reliable collision avoidance in unknown environments. This demands robust perception and mapping, as well as control strategies that can effectively utilize environmental information while enforcing safety constraints. However, to address noisy and sparse measurements from inexpensive onboard sensors commonly used on low-power mobile platforms, probabilistic and continuous map representations have emerged as more effective alternatives to traditional deterministic occupancy grids. Despite their advantages in perception and mapping, their integration into safety-critical control frameworks remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a reactive and safe control strategy that operates over probabilistic maps constructed using Gaussian Process-based continuous representations. Our method combines a reactive control framework with control barrier functions, and incorporates risk measures that consider both occupancy probabilities and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, for practical implementation, we introduce an object-level probabilistic mapping approach suited for indoor environments and integrate it with the proposed control strategy. The resulting framework enables risk-aware, reactive navigation in previously unknown environments. We validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating robust vision-based navigation under uncertainty.},

While secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) are commonly used, attackers can still exploit metadata to profile users and identify vulnerabilities. This research focuses on analyzing the TLS handshake, where encryption parameters are established. Although newer versions of TLS aim to encrypt the Server Name Indication (SNI), we observed that some devices in real-world environments still transmit SNI in plaintext, potentially exposing device identities. Given this practical variability in SNI transmission among diverse IoT devices, we conducted two parallel studies, one including the SNI and one without it, while avoiding Media Access Control (MAC) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to their inherent variability and privacy implications. We used TLS handshake parameters as input for machine learning algorithms to fingerprint IoT devices, classify them by type, and identify manufacturers. Six machine learning models were evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), XGBoost, and CNN+RF. The results showed that CNN+RF achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 99% for device type classification. However, our proposed countermeasure, which enhances TLS handshake privacy by obfuscating specific parameters, significantly reduced fingerprinting accuracy to a maximum of 80% when SNI was excluded. These findings highlight the potential risks of TLS metadata exposure and demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing countermeasures in mitigating IoT device fingerprinting attacks.},

However, limited research has focused on how inertia fluctuates and the underlying principles governing these variations. Therefore, this paper employs statistical methods to unravel the seasonal, periodic, and heteroscedastic dynamic characteristics of inertia using data from the British power grid over the past five years. It integrates the principles of inertia generation and external environmental influences to demonstrate that power system inertia exhibits seasonal, heteroscedastic, and periodic fluctuation characteristics. Furthermore, this paper provides a reasonable explanation for the change mechanism of inertia by comparing and analyzing the inertia, load and renewable energy generation simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Split Computing (SC) is a method that partitions a deep neural network into a head model running on resource-constrained edge devices and a tail model executing on powerful servers. The edge device computes intermediate feature maps, which are sent to the server, significantly lowering local computational demands and reducing communication compared to sending raw input data. This results in improved latency-accuracy trade-offs, enabling real-time inference of large models on constrained edge hardware. While previous research on SC primarily focused on improving training methods, model optimization through automated design approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) remains limited due to substantial supernet training time. This paper proposes a novel method that efficiently applies NAS to SC by fine-tuning a pre-trained supernet from a general Two-stage NAS framework into one tailored for SC. Using publicly available pre-trained supernets significantly reduces training time. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better latency-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art NAS and manual SC designs, requiring only about 13 to 15% of original supernet training time. Additionally, for a practical case study on object detection using the COCO 2017 dataset, models optimized with our proposed method as backbones achieved a 69% latency reduction and 0.4% improved average precision over the EfficientDet baseline.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

Compared to conventional MMC, they benefit from fewer number of submodules (SMs), lower capacitance per submodule and DC fault ride-through capability. However, the AAC VSC controller must ensure appropriate regulation of AC currents in both overlap and non-overlap modes while maintaining minimal harmonic distortion. This paper presents an optimized control design method for the half-bridge (HB) AAC VSC using a Fuzzy Logic (FL) controller. The average modeling of multilevel converters is used to reduce computational burden, and the proposed FLC scheme is employed to regulate AC and circulating currents. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated under short and extended overlap operating modes. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed controller against changes in VSC design parameter of overlap period is also investigated to examine the proposed scheme usefulness in different operating conditions.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for reliable diagnostics in automotive components, accurately assessing engine bearing health under various conditions has become crucial. This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings. Specifically, the focus is on differentiating between healthy and faulty bearings by analyzing key predictive variables—temperature, engine speed, and humidity—and their effects on bearing vibration responses. Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and segmenting arterial plaques in ultrasound images is essential for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents Hybrid Stable AnoGAN (HS-AnoGAN), an enhanced anomaly detection framework based on AnoGAN (Anomaly Generative Adversarial Network), which utilizes generative adversarial learning to model normal anatomical structures and identify abnormal regions indicative of pathology. The proposed approach introduces key improvements, including direct latent space encoding, hybrid reconstruction loss, feature matching in the discriminator, and adaptive thresholding, leading to more precise anomaly localization. Additionally, spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent mode collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply anomaly detection techniques for arterial plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound images. Comparative experiments demonstrate that HS-AnoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.8% increase in detection accuracy, and a 7.5% enhancement in Dice score for segmentation quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of HS-AnoGAN in improving both plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound imaging, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.},

Classical cryptographic hash functions have effectively ensured the integrity of digital evidence. However, they cannot be applied to quantum evidence emerging with the advent of the quantum computing era. This is due to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. To address the challenge of ensuring quantum evidence integrity, this paper introduces a quantum amplitude hash function as a new paradigm. The function operates by directly hashing the entire amplitude, which represents the totality of information within the quantum evidence state, into a hash qubit. The proposed function is implemented as a quantum circuit of constant depth, ensuring excellent scalability. It is theoretically proven to satisfy key cryptographic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance, and sensitivity. Moreover, simulation experiments were conducted to validate the generation of hash qubits for representative quantum algorithms. This work is expected to lay a crucial technical foundation for advancing the field of quantum forensics and preparing for future investigative environments.},

  abstract     = {Balancing assembly lines is one of the biggest problems facing industrial processes. Conventionally, this balancing consists of optimally allocating production tasks between different workstations or stations, taking into account precedence, capacity and cycle time constraints. However, in the face of today's dynamic environment (fluctuations in demand, technical hazards, labor shortages, etc.), static balancing is no longer sufficient. Companies need dynamic rebalancing solutions, designed to adapt task distribution in real time as soon as a perturbation appears. Our study based on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) offers a potentially attractive approach. MAS enable decision-making to be decentralized, with each agent representative of a workstation, a set of tasks, an operator or a piece of equipment. Each agent assesses its situation locally (workload, availability, etc.) and negotiates with the others to achieve a more flexible, proactive assignment of tasks, in line with the principles of Industry 4.0 (connectivity, distributed intelligence and adaptability). The approach proposed in our study is a dynamic framework based on the use of three agents, each of which executes and cooperates with the other agents in order to determine parameters with high variability, propose adjustments and implement them. The results found show that the use of the dynamic balancing environment facilitates monitoring and decision-making through a dynamic dashboard including a set of KPIs specific to balancing. The operational impact of implementing this environment shows a significant increase in terms of productivity and availability, implicitly the synthetic rate of return (‘OEE’) of the production line. As a result, the financial aspect of reconfiguring the line has been reduced thanks to the recommendation agent, which proposes future adjustments without impacting the production line. The line balancing no longer depends on a single a priori measurement, but is instead adapted on an ongoing process, giving greater strength in the face of the uncertainties of a VUCA world.},

We selected a low-resolution Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), but other options, such as the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) outputs are also presented. We analyzed simulated and measured signals. We found that classification is possible with very high reliability, even based on low-resolution representations that the human eye cannot distinguish, such as for Ethernet 100-BaseT and 1000-BaseT.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the measurement of the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructures. The methodology used, aligned with ISO standards and guidelines for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM), involves several steps. First, a checklist is prepared, encompassing all the elements necessary for the infrastructure’s implementation, operation, and end-of-life stages. Then, the environmental impact of each element is modeled in terms of probability distributions, which, in the metrology framework, indicate the lack of complete knowledge about the true amount of emissions associated with the related element. The obtained distributions are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulations to yield an overall distribution of the infrastructure’s environmental impact. Upon determining the resulting emissions, this paper presents the novel concept of the Sustainability Balance. This concept is introduced by comparing the emissions generated by the considered infrastructure with those mitigated through its use. This balance is critical for determining the actual environmental sustainability of the infrastructure. As a practical case study, this methodology is applied to a real and complex monitoring scenario, namely the dynamic fourth lane of the Italian A4 motorway, which represents a comprehensive example of an ICT infrastructure. The Dynamic Fourth Lane allows the emergency lane to be used as an additional traffic lane based on traffic volume, thereby reducing congestion and emissions from idling vehicles. The obtained results highlight the potential for significant environmental benefits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in evaluating and enhancing the sustainability of ICTs.},

  abstract     = {We consider multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion which consist of a number of distributed local sensors and a data fusion center. The data fusion center receives information from the local sensors and fuses them to obtain a final global decision on one of two hypotheses. In this paper, we first revisit and formulate the three major approaches of data fusion in multisensor distributed detection systems in the general case of n distributed sensors; namely, centralized data fusion, hard-decision fusion, and soft-decision fusion. The formulation is based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion assuming that the local sensors are independent and observe the same phenomenon. Then, we propose a new multiple-bit decision fusion approach in multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion. Unlike most of the published studies related to hard-decision fusion, the proposed approach is based on fusing multi-bit decisions instead of fusing one-bit decisions. Unlike most of the published studies related to soft-decision fusion, the proposed approach can be applied easily to identical and non-identical sensors and can be extended easily to any number of sensors and any number of bits per decision. Furthermore, it does not depend on the derivatives of the equations related the false alarm and detection probabilities of the individual sensors and does not require excessive computations as the number of bits per decisions increases. The proposed multiple-bit decision fusion approach is derived and its global performance is evaluated and compared to other fusion approaches in case of noisy Gaussian and Rayleigh distributed observations.},

Pre-trained transformer models typically contain millions of parameters that have been trained with comprehensive datasets improving their generalization, allowing them to be fine-tuned quicker and with less data. Therefore, starting with a pre-trained model provides a substantial advantage over developing a network from the ground up. However, the race to exceed the accuracy of previous model generations leads pre-trained model to increase in size and the required computational resources for inference, as well as training. This is where compression techniques are vital to maximize the impact and performance of the models, while minimizing the cost to deploy.

One of the most severe threats to FL systems is poisoning attacks, which can disrupt model convergence or manipulate prediction outcomes. Addressing these attacks is particularly challenging due to the distributed and opaque nature of FL. To proactively strengthen defenses, we propose HoneyFED, a novel mitigation strategy based on deception. HoneyFED introduces a global decoy model that misleads and disrupts malicious actors by creating obstacles in their attack process. When a potential attacker is detected, the system engages them and captures their poisoned attack methods. This information is used to design a convincing decoy model that appears legitimate to the attacker. As a result, attackers are tricked into believing their attack has succeeded, discouraging further attempts. We evaluate the realism of our decoy using three criteria: indistinguishability from the real model, credibility over time, and viability in influencing attacker behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that HoneyFED effectively defends FL training against various poisoning strategies while improving overall model convergence.},

  abstract     = {Grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) have significantly improved power system reliability and stability by integrating renewable energy sources as voltage sources. Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs), which require an external power source for synchronization, GFMIs operate independently by using internally generated reference signals to regulate voltage and frequency, enabling stable operation even in islanding mode. However, since they primarily depend on reference signals, manipulating these signals can lead to grid instability. While some studies have explored anomaly and cyber-attack detection in conventional power systems, the cybersecurity of GFMIs remains insufficiently addressed, leaving critical vulnerabilities that could disrupt their operation (e.g., power generation system shutdown, frequency oscillation). As cyber-attack techniques advance, these gaps pose significant risks in the transition toward carbon neutrality. This work proposes a novel anomaly classification framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to address the cybersecurity challenges of GFMIs, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Hijacking attacks (HIJ), and short-circuit faults. The model classifies inverter operational states and detects potential anomalies based on measurement signals at the point of common coupling (PCC). Contrastive case studies conducted in MATLAB/Simulink® demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 90% accuracy in anomaly detection and classification, leading to precise deployment of countermeasures. Implementing this approach in GFMIs ensures maximum renewable energy integration with resilience and enhances grid security, supporting a safer transition to a carbon-neutral future.},

The performance of the framework was validated across two tectonically distinct regions, including West Coast Sumatra, Indonesia, and Southern California, USA. It was also benchmarked against five baseline models which were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. The results showed the superiority of the Ens-ConvNARX model which achieved multi-step predictive accuracies up to 88.5% in West Coast Sumatra and 90.2% in Southern California. An ablation study also confirmed the critical role of the Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) filter, as its removal reduced the one-month-ahead prediction accuracy by 50 percentage points. This study presents a robust and generalizable framework for seismic prediction and shows the important synergy between advanced model architecture and rigorous data preprocessing for improving disaster preparedness and response in seismically active regions.},

  abstract     = {In DC distribution networks integrating distributed generation, DC transformers (DCT) exhibit asymmetric forward and reverse power flows, with reverse power flow range being limited. Based on this characteristic, this paper proposes a hybrid resonant (HR) DC-DC converter for DCTs. Distinguished from traditional dual active bridge (DAB) converters and Hybrid Non-resonant (HNR) DC-DC converters, the proposed HR converter features a low-voltage hybrid resonant bridge composed of a low-voltage-side active bridge (LAB) and a low-voltage-side diode bridge (LDB) in parallel, enabling efficient adaptation to such asymmetric power flows. It not only satisfies power transmission requirements but also simplifies system complexity and reduces costs. Key technical aspects, including converter topology, operation modes, suppression of circulating currents in reverse mode, and impact of leakage inductance in high-frequency transformers, are analyzed in detail. Comparative studies show that the HR converter reduces semiconductor costs by 33.43% and conversion losses by 16.22% compared to DAB and HNR converters. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and performance benefits of the proposed converter.},

A modified rectangular-shaped radiator with a ground plane integrated with a small open-ended slot is conceptualized as a quasi-monopole ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with compact dimensions of 24 mm × 17 mm. The ultra-wide range is achieved using exciting wideband modes where modal significance ≥ 0.8. The three notched bands (NBs) are designed by introducing various slots in the radiator, which produce radiation-cancelling modes with opposite current directions at the corresponding slots. Then, a four-element MIMO antenna is created by arranging each antenna element (AE) in an orthogonal configuration. The multiply-shaped structure, combined with a square ring, provides orthogonal modes for high isolation between AEs. The MIMO antenna construction achieves 2−16.49 GHz bandwidth, 6.72 dB peak gain, and more than 75% radiation efficiency with >16 dB isolation between the AEs. Diversity performances are observed to be within adequate limits.},

However, developing reliable AI based detection systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of real world training data in such sensitive domains. This paper proposes a novel persona-driven data augmentation framework using Large Language Model(LLM) to generate realistic synthetic drug-dealing dialogues. By encoding domain specific buyer and seller personas along with linguistic behaviour rules, the method produces contextually coherent and semantically diverse dialogues that reflect authentic communication styles. Evaluation results demonstrate that the augmented data preserves key stylistic features (high cosine similarity), maintains lexical diversity (TTR), improves fluency (perplexity), and enhances coherence and lexical richness (ROUGE-L), outperforming traditional augmentation method. Furthermore, statistical validation confirms the semantic consistency and stability of the generated data. These findings highlight the viability of LLM-based augmentation in low-resource, high-risk domains and suggest its potential transferability to other specialized NLP applications requiring context-preserving generation.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and modeling workflows is crucial for advancing digital transformation and intelligent process management in the electric power industry. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, data in the power sector presents unique challenges—including complex formatting, limited structured annotations, and extensive use of domain-specific terminology—that hinder the direct application of general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms often struggle with long procedural texts due to high computational overhead, excessive resource consumption, and unstable global semantic representations, further limiting their effectiveness in power workflow modeling tasks.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a domain-adapted LLM framework tailored for the standardization of electric power workflows and introduces a specialized model, Lumina BPM, designed for this task. The model incorporates a hybrid sparse self-attention mechanism that retains attention on initial tokens and dynamically selects the most relevant historical tokens based on query context. This design reduces the need to compute full-sequence dense attention matrices, thereby lowering computational costs while improving the model’s ability to capture critical information from lengthy and complex process descriptions.Experimental results show that Lumina BPM accurately transforms standardized procedural texts into executable piperflow statements and generates corresponding BPMN 2.0 diagrams. The proposed approach significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of workflow modeling, offering a practical pathway toward intelligent process standardization in critical infrastructure domains.},

By strategically selecting the most informative and uncertain data points for labeling, our method enhances defensive capabilities while significantly reducing the reliance on large, pre-labeled datasets. Experiments conducted on the NASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset against CW, FGSM, and JSMA attacks demonstrate that this approach yields significant gains. Specifically, the Random Forest model paired with active learning achieves a superior accuracy of 89%. This robust performance is achieved while requiring 42% fewer labeled instances compared to a traditional supervised approach, at the cost of a 28% increase in iterative training time.

Based on this, a multi-objective path planning model is established with the dual optimization goals of minimizing energy consumption and collision risk. To overcome the limitations of traditional MOPSO, such as poor adaptability and susceptibility to local optima, this paper introduces improvements in particle encoding, update strategy, and external archive mechanism to enhance convergence and solution diversity.

Meanwhile, the fuzzy entropy values of the signals at different coarse-grained scales are calculated separately to determine the appropriate mode components and accurately calibrate the transient signals, and the effect of the method on the calibration of the wave heads in different noise environments is compared.

In particular, each UAV combines its own measurements with those of other UAVs to be subsequently processed using an event-triggered distributed extended Kalman filter algorithm to obtain its estimates of target vessels’ positions. The UAVs then use the position estimates of the targets to construct dynamic convex hulls that connect all of the detected moving target vessels. The multi-UAV tracker system then generates spatio-temporal reference path curves using cycloid-type trajectories with a formation geometry that is adapted in such a way to cover/contain the constructed convex hulls of the target vessels. Based on the generated reference path, a distributed cooperative control law based on the moving path following approach is finally proposed to maintain tracker-target’s relative geometry that guarantee accurate tracking of the moving vessels.

Both spectral and temporal features were extracted from the audio recordings for feature extraction. This paper explores state-of-the-art detection frameworks for deepfake audio, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced deep learning (DL) frameworks. Specifically, the performance of the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), a residual CNN integrated with an attention mechanism and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ResCNN-Attention-BGRU), WIREnet (a variant of BLSTM), the residual network for fully connected (ResNet FC), and a squeeze-and-excitation-enhanced one-dimensional CNN (SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN) were compared. The proposed models achieved notable testing accuracies, with SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN reaching the highest at 97.64%, followed by ResNet FC (97.46%) and WIREnet (97.20%), demonstrating strong generalization across the evaluated architectures. Furthermore, we experimented with different numbers of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), specifically 13, 26, and 39, in combination with other spectral and temporal features.

In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique utilizing multi-level Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that addresses two main challenges: shot walks and viewpoint issues. Human skeletal structures and movements are represented in the form of multi-level graphs. The proposed technique uses both frame-level graphs (postures) and subwalk-level (quick movements) as gait features to capture relationships among the entire body and characteristic of quick movements. The stochastic process and skip connections withinGNNframework are employed to enhance flexibility, increase robustness, prevent overfitting and improve gradient flow. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 2-second walks, where each sequence contains only 40 frames, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on very short walk sequences. The proposed technique outperforms existing techniques on both top-k accuracy test and the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) Curves. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves 85.54% on the top-1 accuracy test and surpass 95% accuracy in ranks below 10. These results suggest that unique posture and quick movement are sufficient to identify a person. The strong performance of the proposed technique on dataset that contains short walking sequences and viewpoint variations demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications in security, surveillance and authentication where accurate identification from limited gait data obtained from various observation angles is crucial.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles, intelligent regenerative braking systems (IRBS) have emerged as an effective solution for energy-efficient car-following control. However, current IRBS implementations lack personalization and require drivers to select fixed braking levels, often causing discomfort by failing to reflect individual preferences. Existing personalization techniques rely on deep learning or offline-trained models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). To address these limitations, this study proposes a computationally efficient parameter adaptation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), enabling real-time personalized car-following control in IRBS. The proposed method adopts a dynamic relative speed (DRS) spacing policy to capture individual driving characteristics. A reference data generator generates real-time reference data during specific driver interventions, allowing the EKF algorithm to adapt control parameters accordingly. Simulation tests using a driver model demonstrated a significant reduction in driver interventions and maintained inter-vehicle distances aligned with the driver’s preferred distance. Vehicle tests further confirmed the algorithm’s real-time performance and low computational load, affirming its suitability for large-scale production. This study presents a practical and scalable method for personalizing IRBS-based car-following control without complex learning architectures, thereby enhancing driving comfort and expanding applicability to ADAS technologies such as adaptive cruise control (ACC).},

Traditional max pressure-based control systems prioritize optimizing throughput based on known queue lengths but often overlook the impact of intersection delays and real-world operational constraints. This study aims to develop a decentralized max-pressure-based traffic signal control system that integrates both queue length and delay effects within the max-pressure framework by introducing a novel performance metric called queue dissipation time into the control strategy. The proposed cyclic-based max pressure algorithm relies on sample travel time data obtained from probe data sources. It considers pre-defined phase sequences to enhance real-world applicability. When evaluated in a simulation environment with a realistic 20% vehicle re-identification penetration rate, the proposed approach achieved queue and delay performance comparable to control strategies relying on complete vehicle arrival data. Furthermore, implementing dynamic cycle length led to a 23% reduction in delay compared to the fixed-cycle max pressure method, inferring the benefits of adaptive timing adjustments. By incorporating queue dissipation time and considering the constraints of real-world signal operations, the proposed control system enhances the practicality of max pressure-based traffic signal strategies. This study provides a foundation for implementing decentralized adaptive traffic signal control in urban networks, particularly in environments with limited vehicle data availability. The algorithm exhibited reliable performance across various levels of data availability, delivering comparable results under both low (20%) and high (50%) penetration rate scenarios. This consistency highlights its adaptability and operational feasibility, without requiring excessive traffic data or extensive infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {Existing Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs), which enable private voice input, are often hampered by user dependency—a critical barrier requiring extensive training data from each individual. To address this, we propose SilentWhisper, a system that achieves truly user-independent recognition of ultra-low volume (45-50dB) whispered speech using only standard microphones. By fine-tuning a pre-trained speech recognition model on a multi-user dataset, our method allows anyone to use the system immediately without per-user adaptation. We validate our user-independent claim through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation with 13 participants, which confirmed a significant reduction in the average Character Error Rate (CER) from 17.0% to 7.3% (a 57.1% improvement). Crucially, this specialized fine-tuning is also robust; the model maintains performance comparable to the powerful baseline on unseen texts, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on a 1,002-word vocabulary, our system’s strong performance represents a significant step towards a practical, private conversational interface that is accessible to all.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a Scalable Multi-Arm Interleaved Zeta Converter with Parallel Switch Modulation for renewable-powered electrolyzers. The proposed converter features low current and voltage ripple, reduced power losses, and minimized magnetic volume. The use of parallel switches combined with an interleaved PWM technique simplifies the design and enhances performance without requiring inductors proportional to the number of arms. Key advantages include electrolyzer voltage and current ripple frequencies six times higher than the switching frequency, as well as output capacitor current ripple frequencies also six times higher. In addition, the inductor and coupling capacitor current ripple frequencies are twice the switching frequency. This behavior enables a significant reduction in the volume and mass of passive components, thereby improving power density. The paper presents the steady-state operating principles under continuous conduction mode, design guidelines, mathematical derivations, and a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art converters. A 6-kW proof-of-concept prototype was experimentally tested with a DC bus voltage of 480 V and an electrolyzer voltage of 250 V, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 98.16%, supported by experimental results and an accompanying demonstration video.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are neural network models that integrate spatial information into time series processing, and have been successfully applied in various applications. Although these models have demonstrated strong prediction capabilities, most existing STGNN architectures require a significant memory size and long training times. Some lightweight versions of STGNNs have been proposed, but they still rely on expert-driven manual designs to improve performance, which require implicit domain-specific knowledge that varies across datasets. This design approach limits their adaptability to different application scenarios. To address this limitation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to automate the STGNN design process. However, existing NAS-based approaches prioritize prediction accuracy rather than resource efficiency. As a result, current approaches fail to provide compact model architectures or efficient training and limit their scalability. In this work, we introduce SearchLight, a novel NAS-based STGNN framework to automatically discover lightweight STGNN models while maintaining prediction performance. We set two cells for spatial and temporal operations into two distinct sets to capture spatial and temporal data features better for each cell type of the NAS method. We specialize in cell types for spatial and temporal information so that the model can better capture and combine the intrinsic features of spatial and temporal data.We employ a multi-objective search strategy that optimizes both model compactness and prediction accuracy to enable our method to discover lightweight and accurate STGNN models. Experimental results across several real-world datasets show that SearchLight reduces the model size by an average of ×103.0 and training time by an average of ×74.0, while sacrificing a small amount of prediction performance, an average of 1.6%p, compared to manually designed and existing NAS-based STGNN models.},

However, despite this growth, the sector continues to face significant challenges worldwide, including labor shortages, safety risks, and low levels of process automation. Construction progress monitoring is a key process that requires automation enhancement. This study examines the current Construction Progress Monitoring (CPM) process, with a focus on the adoption of technologies for data acquisition, integration, inspection, and visualization in construction environments. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify existing studies, their findings and contributions, leading to the Construction Progress Monitoring using technologies (CPMTech) model. A case study was then performed on an active construction site to validate an instance of the proposed model, specifically for manual and controlled data acquisition processes. Additionally, a virtual environment simulation was used to validate an instance of the model for autonomous data acquisition. The results correspond to the CPMTech model and its instances validated in real and simulated scenarios. The contributions stand out for supporting computing, automation, and civil engineering professionals in integrating technologies to the CPM. Thus, CPMTech represents a significant step forward in the gradual and continuous adoption of technologies for monitoring construction progress, overcoming traditional methods that have limited the sector’s potential for decades.},

Space-borne low-power IoTs sensors are power-hungry at highly variable rates during mission operations. The total energy reserve of the CubeSat-IoTs system is 24 hours premium resource constrained by the small satellite’s solar eclipse regime(s). With the conventional heavy and rigid silicon-based solar technology design reaching its efficiency, use cases, and application limits, perovskite photovoltaic (PPV) solar cells have emerged as a worthy alternative. PPV’s flexible and lightweight properties, cost-effective silicon panels’ efficiency-boosting capability, and comparably cheaper production cost have attracted substantial commercial and scientific interests worldwide. To eliminate this problem, we propose a hybrid multiband radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester to sustain the constellation and/or clusters of CubeSat-IoTs systems operations anytime, anywhere, and optimise power supply equipment sizing and thermal reliability evaluation. This paper presents a multi-source multimode radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester development at the conceptual design phase of a CubeSat mission. This is supported by an experimental measurement of the actual power consumption of a field programmable gates array (FPGA) device in a typical CubeSat mission’s digital design implementation. The power estimate is as close to the value obtained at the system integration phase. The results show that the FPGA device’s quiescent (static) power consumptions at 50 and 100 MHz are 78 mW and 79 mW, respectively. Hybrid adaptive beamformed massive multiple-input-multiple-output heterogeneous cellular network (mMIMO-HetNets) green energy transmission and harvesting promise to address the small form factor (size, weight, power and cost) requirements and/or constraints of future sustainable small satellite missions in the LEO. The energy efficiency savings of the proposed multimode multiband RF-PPV energy harvesting and transmission system for the METCubeSat-IoTs mission is 0.23 Gb/J. This has enabled an energy budget balance for the operational space-borne devices with a multi-source N-power mode of operation to be developed for green 5G/6G/Wi-Fi and future-generation satellite-cellular convergence ecosystem and CubeSat-IoTs missions.},

In educational settings, for instance, a system can use information about the Learning Styles (LSs) of a student to provide them with adequate study materials. Furthermore, with the growing use of Learning Management System (LMS) platforms, such as Moodle, continuous streams of user data highlight the need to compute student models dynamically to support adaptive decision-making in teaching and learning. This paper introduces a framework for Dynamic User Modeling (DUMING) to create evolving Dynamic User Models (DUMs) that capture and adapt to changes in student LSs over time, based on event log streams from an LMS. This framework leverages the Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) and integrates Data Stream Mining (DSM) and Process Mining (PM) techniques across three layers: collection, preprocessing, and mining. Collected event streams are processed within landmark windows and classified into High-Level Events (HLEs) based on LMS functionality. The STREAMKMeans algorithm clusters events, and the PM phase uses Alpha Miner (AM), Heuristic Miner (HM), and Inductive Miner (IM) algorithms to identify learning paths represented as Petri Nets (PNs), with IM showing the highest values in the quality metrics used. Implemented and evaluated in a course using Moodle at the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico, the framework employs IF-THEN rules to relate HLE proportions to FSLSM-based LSs, visualizing changes through radar charts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating adaptive DUMs, providing insights that enhance over time educational support and enable timely interventions.},

  abstract     = {Effective capacity planning in outpatient departments faces several challenges, particularly long patient waiting times and insufficient working time due to the increasing workload of senior doctors. Lean thinking, a methodology that improves efficiency by eliminating waste, has been widely adopted in healthcare operations. A recent approach integrated lean thinking with integer linear programming to improve capacity planning by optimizing resource allocation. Particularly, it reduces workload by transferring patients from senior to associate senior doctors. However, the existing model involves only doctors while neglecting other medical staff, and lacks a guarantee of balanced workload distribution after patient transfers. Therefore, incorporating additional medical staff and rebalancing the workload are required to reduce maximum working time and achieve a balanced workload among staff, respectively. In this paper, we propose two enhanced ILP-based lean thinking-enabled models, OCPlean1 and OCPlean2, to further improve planning efficiency and workload balance. OCPlean1 incorporates nurses into the model to reduce the maximum working time for the doctors by delegating certain examination services from associate senior doctors to nurses. In addition to that, OCPlean2 introduces an adaptive workload balancing strategy aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of workload after patient transfers. Experimental results demonstrate that OCPlean1 significantly reduces maximum workload under varying conditions, including different numbers of doctors and patients, and fluctuating diagnosis and examination times. On the other hand, OCPlean2 achieves a more balanced workload distribution. These findings contribute to more efficient and sustainable outpatient scheduling models and support better utilization of healthcare personnel.},

However, while many studies on UAV-assisted MEC systems focus on optimizing factors such as delay and energy consumption, fewer consider user satisfaction, which is an important determinant of overall system efficiency. This paper aims to address this gap. Specifically, we first develop a novel user satisfaction model by jointly considering processing delay, desired delay, marginal delay, delay sensitivity, and time sensitivity of the tasks. Then, we formulate an optimization problem that considers both computational resource allocation and task offloading decisions to maximize total user satisfaction while minimizing total energy consumption. Finally, a SAC-based US (User Satisfaction)-oriented Task Offloading (SAC-USTO) algorithm is proposed to address the task offloading problem, and a Task Size-based Resource Allocation (TS-RA) algorithm is introduced to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other baseline methods.},

The model demonstrates high segmentation precision even with complex backgrounds and indistinct lesion boundaries. It achieves a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.09% and accuracy of 98.17%. It also recorded the lowest training time of 989 minutes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, ResUNet, DeepLabV3, and Tuned DeepLabV3+ across all three datasets confirms its superior performance. Furthermore, the model is employed to assess disease severity and estimate crop loss using a severity scale designed by plant pathologists. This scale links lesion area to severity level and crop loss. Results indicate a crop loss between 1 to 5% for Datasets 1 and 2.

Although ultrasonic guided waves can effectively inspect pipelines, the complex geometry of pipe bends poses distinct challenges to their propagation. This study rigorously examined guided-wave testing methods for pipe bends in marine pipelines. The semi-analytical finite element method was initially used to compute the dispersion curves and mode structures of the guided waves for a typical marine pipeline. Mode structure analysis at the pipe bends identified the torsional T(0,1) mode, focusing on the extrados. Finite element simulations then characterized the T(0,1) mode scattering at the pipe bends. Using the trigonometric circumferential distribution of guided wave modes, signals for specific circumferential orders were extracted from the simulated data to elucidate the modal composition and propagation paths of the primary T(0,1) scattered signals. This establishes a theoretical framework for interpreting guided wave signals in pipe-bend inspections. Experiments confirmed the heightened sensitivity of the T(0,1) mode to extrados defects, validating theoretical mode structure analyses.},

Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013. The proposed work demonstrates a marked increase in performance over the existing literature. The promising results and contributions of this work will significantly advance research.},

However, anomaly detection during wafer probing remains challenging due to issues such as probe-to-wafer misalignment, pad scratches, and electrical noise from friction. To address these challenges, we introduce SwinProbeFormer, a model specifically designed to detect overgain anomalies in wafer prober equipment using dynamic probe sensor data collected during the wafer probing process. Built on the Swin Transformer architecture, SwinProbeFormer leverages window-based attention and cyclic shifts to enhance spatial-temporal learning while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that SwinProbeFormer outperforms the vanilla Transformer encoder used in AnomalyBERT, achieving the highest F1 scores among baseline models. It also demonstrates strong generalization across diverse production lots, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for practical deployment in wafer probing environments.},

While convolutional neural networks, such as ResNet-50, consistently demonstrate high classification accuracy, understanding their internal decision-making processes, particularly across heterogeneous land use categories, remains a critical challenge. This paper examines the interpretability of deep learning-based classification models using two prominent Explainable AI techniques: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet-50 model on the EuroSAT dataset, we analyzed twenty representative satellite image samples, comprising both correctly and incorrectly classified instances across ten land use classes. Grad-CAM generated class-discriminative spatial attention maps that identified salient regions influencing the model’s predictions, while LIME provided super pixel-based visual explanations reflecting localized feature contributions. Comparative analysis of both techniques revealed consistent patterns of model attention and exposed spectral and spatial ambiguities that underlie misclassification. These insights not only enhance the interpretability of CNN-based remote sensing models but also inform the development of more transparent and reliable Earth observation systems.},

  abstract     = {Efficient task scheduling is fundamental to real-time systems, where minimizing deadline misses and improving stability and determinism are the main goals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling specifically designed for real-time workloads by integrating hybrid laxity-priority scheduling to manage aperiodic tasks with varying priorities. The design includes limiting preemption overhead by blocking unnecessary preemptions and dynamically adapting to incoming sensor data. We extend our algorithm by taking environmental conditions into account, where the weight of laxity and priorities can change based on the circumstances. This also includes the effect of external conditions, namely weather conditions on the priority of tasks. The scheduler is designed for systems such as ADAS, where tasks have different priorities, but are not necessarily dependent on each other. Aperiodic tasks are harder to schedule due to the many unpredictable factors that make up the task. Focusing on aperiodic tasks, the proposed multi-core task scheduler design handles sensor-triggered events and adapts scheduling dynamically by prioritizing running tasks by blocking unnecessary preemption. Experimental results using software-based validation demonstrate improved deadline adherence, affirming the performance of the proposed scheduler compared to classical and real-time schedulers. This study evaluates the scheduler's performance based on key metrics including deadline misses, preempting, makespan, and the proportion of high-priority deadline misses relative to total deadline misses. Our proposed algorithm demonstrated a miss rate 6% lower than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for similar tasksets.},

This paper presents an adaptive modified robust inverse of signum error (AM-RISE) control method, which achieves reliable trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.},

  abstract     = {The Hybrid Modular Multilevel Converter (HMMC) topology—comprising full-bridge (FB) and half-bridge (HB) submodules—is effective for DC fault clearance in HVDC systems. However, to prevent overvoltage in lower-arm full-bridge submodules (FBSMs) during valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault mitigation—an uncommon yet critical internal fault in bipolar HVDC systems—the proportion of FBSMs used must account for approximately 86.6% of the arm voltage, compared to 43.3% for DC-side fault blocking. This diminishes the economic advantage of HMMC over fully full-bridge MMC topology. This paper proposes an HMMC SPG fault mitigation method using thyristor-based current commutation branches on the lower arms and a ground-side mechanical interrupter, while maintaining the minimum number of FBSMs required for conventional DC fault clearance. The method mitigates SPG-resultant lower-arm overvoltage by commutating current into the thyristor branches, after which the mechanical interrupter clear lower arms current, and subsequently thyristor branches are turned-off to clear the SPG-valve side fault. Additionally, the pole current is cleared using a mechanical breaker or passive oscillation DC circuit breaker (CB), effectively suppressing upper-arm submodule (SM) overvoltage under SPG valve-side fault in both short- and long-distance HMMC bipolar links. Although additional equipment is required, it incurs no on-state losses during steady-state operation. The proposed method is compared with existing SPG fault clearance approaches for HMMC bipolar systems. Its effectiveness is validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and benchmarked against prior SPG fault clearance methods for HMMC systems.},

These measurements are averaged for noise reduction and then transmitted via the CAN bus in structured byte-array packets. Implementation involves initializing system control, GPIO, ADC, CAN, and timer peripherals. The ADC continuously samples signals and stores them in lookup tables; converted values are packaged using pre-configured CAN mailboxes and sent at regular intervals using a timer-based ISR. Additionally, the system integrates a secondary CAN node (Arduino) to demonstrate multi-node communication. Visualization and validation are achieved through an Integrated Guidance and Control Display Unit (IGCDU) and a CAN Bus Analyzer. The authors have developed and implemented the complete embedded system architecture, including real-time signal acquisition routines, ADC-to-angle conversion algorithms, multi-node CAN communication logic, and visualization through IGCDU.

To train the ML algorithm, a combined dataset of both geospatial and operational data is implemented. While pressure is often estimated using complex hydraulic simulations, this study proposes and evaluates a lightweight linear pressure approximation method based on expert knowledge. The ML model is applied to a real DHN in Denmark through collaboration with the utility company HOFOR. Due to a significant class imbalance in the data (∼1:215), multiple oversampling (OS) strategies are investigated. Model performance is evaluated using fault capture versus length capture (FCLC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The inclusion of pressure data is found to improve the AUC by 4.5%, and the model captures over 40% of failures by inspecting only 10% of the network. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using ML-based fault vulnerability prediction as a tool for predictive maintenance and asset replacement planning in DHNs.},

This paper presents two new Neuro-Fuzzy controllers for Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs): the Direct Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (DNF-CW), which adapts parameters online using fixed-structure rules, and the Indirect Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (IDNF-CW), which uses an online identifier to measure plant sensitivity. Chebyshev wavelet-based neural networks are utilized in the consequent part of both controllers to enable accurate local modeling and improved damping performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system and the IEEE 9-bus multi-machine system under a variety of fault and loading conditions. Benchmark comparisons include a conventional Indirect Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (IDNF-TSK) based controller, a configuration without STATCOM (No STATCOM), and a configuration with STATCOM but without auxiliary control (No Control). In the SMIB scenario, the IDNF-CW achieves a 40% reduction in settling time compared to the IDNF-TSK. In the more demanding multi-machine setup, the IDNF-CW restores stability within 3 seconds after a sequence of faults, outperforming DNF-CW and IDNF-TSK. Additionally, reductions of over 53% in the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) and 36% in the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) are observed. These tests under multiple fault conditions and 10% measurement noise confirm stable operation, with overshoot limited to 3.57%–4.7% and minimal impact on settling time.

Machine vision technology plays a crucial role in scrap metal recycling, where accurate identification of waste metals has consistently been a key focus in this field. To address issues such as missed detections, false positives, and low detection accuracy caused by complex backgrounds in copper and aluminium scrap detection, along with the need for lightweight deployment, an improved YOLOv11n-based detection model for copper and aluminium scraps is proposed. The C3k2_Star_CAA module was designed to replace the original C3K2 module, improving feature extraction and target recognition in complex environments. The FPNSC module was introduced in place of the original SPPF module to capture finer features while keeping the model lightweight. A Feature Focus Diffusion Pyramid Network (FDPN) was adopted to substitute the original feature pyramid network, enhancing multi-scale feature fusion through FocusFeature modules and a diffusion mechanism. Additionally, a Dynamic Detection Head (DyHead) was incorporated to replace the original detection head, integrating multi-scale features to improve detection accuracy for objects of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved model achieved a 9% increase in mAP@0.5, a 6.5% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95, along with 3.9% higher Precision, 12.4% better Recall, and 8.2% greater F1-Score on the dataset, while also showing significant improvements in both parameter count and detection speed, making it more suitable for copper and aluminium scrap detection tasks.

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

Traditional machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have achieved notable progress but often struggle to integrate rich textual context and provide interpretable reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a high-efficiency synchronous buck converter IC featuring wide load-range capability and ultra-low power consumption. The design employs an integrated PWM/PFM control scheme where a clamp circuit integrated into the PWM control loop and a clamp-current-dependent frequency-reduction module enable PFM operation under light-load conditions. This architecture achieves seamless PWM-to-PFM transition with minimized output voltage ripple, enhances light-load efficiency, and significantly reduces circuit complexity. Implementation of peak/valley current detection modules elevates sensing accuracy and control precision, thereby improving dynamic response characteristics. A time-division module activation strategy further reduces the controller's quiescent current, optimizing ultra-light-load efficiency. The power-enable control module establishes dual-stability mechanisms for power rails and reference voltages, ensuring controlled module activation only after stable initialization to guarantee proper power sequencing and operational reliability. Fabricated in 0.18μm BCD technology, measurement results demonstrate stable startup characteristics, smooth PWM/PFM transitions, 95.43% peak efficiency at 8V-to-5V conversion, >90% efficiency across the 5mA-6A load range, and 12.3μA no-load ground current.},

  abstract     = {The growing importance of thermal imaging in a variety of fields, including medical diagnostics, security, and environmental monitoring, emphasizes the critical need for efficient deep learning models capable of analysing thermal data. The training of these algorithms is much limited by the absence of suitably annotated thermal imaging datasets. We propose LiquidGAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture which integrates the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) to address the scarcity of annotated thermal imaging datasets. LiquidGAN employs a fixed-step Runge-Kutta solver to refine the latent representations, enabling continuous image transformations through an encoder-ODE-decoder generator. The LNN-based discriminator adaptively models the subtle and the dynamic temperature features, hence improving the ability to distinguish the real images from synthetic images. By integrating ODE-driven liquid dynamics across both generator and the discriminator, LiquidGAN effectively captures the dynamic temperature variations while stabilizing adversarial training under the limited data conditions. Moreover, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and the gradient scaling is used in our work to further improve the computational efficiency. Experimental results on multiple thermal imaging datasets, including those related to surveillance, healthcare, and precision agriculture, suggest that LiquidGAN offers a promising direction for generating high-fidelity synthetic thermal images under data-constrained conditions.},

Numerous current solutions depend on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks or black-box artificial intelligence (AI) models, which frequently encounter challenges related to interoperability, transparency, and reproducibility. To overcome these constraints, this research developed an ontology-driven expert system that formalizes knowledge of crops, soil, and climate into a modular framework capable of generating explicable irrigation recommendations. The system was developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and augmented with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, employing a hybrid development methodology that integrates the structured precision of the V-cycle with the data-driven focus of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and the semantic precision of the NeOn (Networked Ontologies) methodology. Competency questions guided the development of numerous agricultural concepts pertaining to irrigation. Scenario-based assessments validated that the ontology accurately deduced crop coefficient (Kc), integrated AI-predicted ET0 with sensor-derived assertions, and produced consistent irrigation or non-irrigation recommendations across diverse situations. All reasoning processes performed in under one second, showcasing computational efficiency. Thus, the research provides a replicable and adaptable foundation for ontology-based irrigation decision support, facilitating future implementation using real-time sensor data and field validation.},

However, dealing with highly complex, possibly nonlinear, and noisy systems remains an open problem. In recent years, the use of data-driven techniques based on machine learning for system identification has represented a promising solution for addressing the challenges of complex system identification. Among these methods, auto-encoders have been successfully applied to compactly represent the system state in a latent space used for estimating the system dynamics. In this work, we propose leveraging the ensemble paradigm for system identification, and in particular to exploit an ensemble of autoencoders, to reduce the uncertainty compared to individual autoencoders. To this end, we propose an algorithm for selecting autoencoders based on a combination of an accuracy metric and a diversity index.We validated this approach using traditional benchmarks in the field of nonlinear system identification.},

Unlike conventional inverters operating at 50–60 Hz, this design supports high-speed motors (above 100,000 rpm) by increasing the fundamental frequency to 2 kHz. A detailed comparison between two-level and three-level T-type topologies is conducted, with the selected topology maintaining over 99% efficiency across a wide frequency range. The design incorporates detailed loss modelling, a low-inductance PCB layout, and optimized DC-link capacitor selection to ensure robust high-frequency operation. The influence of modulation index and switching frequency ratio on inverter efficiency and current total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed, highlighting their impact on thermal performance and current quality. Thermal simulations using PLECS estimate a peak efficiency of 99.3%.

  abstract     = {Logic locking is a design-for-trust technique aiming to protect the intellectual property of integrated circuits from piracy throughout the global semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking inserts key-controlled elements (e.g., Boolean gates, referred to as key-gates) into the circuit. A secret locking key activates the functionality of the circuit, preventing unauthorized access to the design. However, the security of logic locking has been threatened by advanced machine learning-based attacks that rely solely on the structure of the locked circuit (i.e., gate-level netlist) to break logic locking and decipher the keys. Manually identifying the vulnerabilities in logic locking design, in terms of the key-gate type chosen and the location of key-gate insertion, has proven insufficient in safeguarding logic locking. Therefore, we propose OptiLock, a first-of-its-kind automated logic locking framework that supports different types of key-gates and automatically finds learning-resilient places to insert the key-gates to thwart a specific attack on logic locking, without requiring any prior knowledge of how to thwart the attack. It employs a simulated annealing algorithm in addition to customized and adjustable fitness evaluation functions that allow OptiLock to find learning-resilient logic locking solutions in terms of security and implementation overhead. OptiLock successfully thwarts four state-of-the-art attacks (MuxLink, OMLA, SCOPE, and SAAM) by optimizing the insertion of X(N)OR or multiplexer key-gates. Evaluations across ISCAS-85, ITC-99, EPFL, Ariane RISC-V benchmarks, and CVA6 RISC-V CPU design show that the proposed key-gate insertion is tailored to the original circuit structure, rather than relying on predefined locking strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate that OptiLock thwarts structural attacks such as SnapShot, Redundancy, and Resynthesis. Our evaluation further shows that OptiLock performs multi-objective optimization, achieving the desired security level while minimizing implementation costs, achieving an average delay reduction of 70.18% compared to random logic locking.},

In response to the increasing need for robust computational solutions in environmental informatics, this study advances remote sensing–based modeling techniques to analyze nutrient pollution with high spatial and temporal resolution. Traditional remote estimation methods for nutrient indicators struggle to generalize across varied geospatial contexts and dynamic climatic interactions due to reliance on rigid empirical assumptions and static input features. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-aware deep learning architecture—integrated with atmospheric transport theory and guided by region-specific data assimilation. This method, constructed on a transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder framework, extracts latent patterns from multi-source inputs, including meteorological data and emission inventories. Our domain-adaptive optimization strategy dynamically calibrates spatial biases using regionally embedded emission priors, enhancing generalization across heterogeneous land-water interfaces. Experimental validation demonstrates our model’s capacity to capture fine-grained concentration gradients while maintaining physical consistency, significantly outperforming traditional regression and neural baselines. This approach exemplifies how informatics and intelligent systems can be leveraged for environmental pattern discovery, advancing the journal’s mission in AI-powered remote sensing, environmental simulation, and computational sustainability.},

In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that integrates microscopic imaging with deep learning to measure inhibition zones of Staphylococcus aureus, providing enhanced precision and deeper insights into bacterial behavior. A YOLOv8-based neural network was optimized using 74 microscopic training images and validated with 78 independent cases. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 89.74% within a tolerance of ±0.2 mm, exhibiting a strong Pearson correlation with expert measurements (r = 0.94). This performance represents a 90% reduction in measurement error compared to conventional Petri dish evaluations, where variability often reaches 2.0 mm. Additionally, the system demonstrated robustness across different microscope models, including one not employed during training, highlighting its generalization capacity. Beyond accuracy, this methodology enables automated, reproducible, and rapid measurements, significantly reducing analysis time while eliminating operator subjectivity. Importantly, by capturing bacterial growth dynamics at the microscopic scale, the method allows early detection of bacterial susceptibility, potentially reducing clinical decision-making times from days to hours. This advancement holds considerable promise for antimicrobial nanomaterial evaluation, epidemiological studies, and clinical diagnostics.

After that, the normalized magnetic data are filtered by using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. Finally, we present a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network for indoor localization using fingerprinting technique. We use three datasets in three different locations in the Faculty of Engineering. Results show that Bi-LSTM neural network has achieved the best localization performance among Feed Forward Neural (FFN) Network, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network and LSTM neural network. Compared to the performance of the mentioned neural networks, the proposed system had the least mean and standard deviation (SD) root mean square error (RMSE) for indoor localization in the datasets.

Traditional interpolation methods often compromise image quality by introducing artifacts and losing critical detail, especially in complex images generated by Division of Focal Plane (DoFP) sensors. These sensors face unique challenges due to their low-resolution outputs and their ability to capture polarized light at different angles, e.g., 0°,45°,90°,and 135°. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Guided Residual Interpolation Network (AGRIN), a novel deep learning framework designed specifically for the interpolation of DoFP images. AGRIN leverages residual learning and attention mechanisms to enhance interpolation performance by focusing on significant image regions while preserving high-frequency details often neglected by conventional techniques. Our results demonstrate that AGRIN significantly outperforms traditional methods, as measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and qualitative assessments, especially when interpolating liver cancer images captured at various polarization angles. The results indicate that AGRIN effectively captures essential features with minimal distortion, validating its efficiency and suitability for high-stakes imaging applications that require precise interpolation.

  abstract     = {Abnormal traffic patterns caused by extreme events can significantly disrupt traffic flow across large regions of urban road networks. Timely and reliable detection of such disruptions is crucial for effective traffic management. However, existing anomaly detection methods cannot simultaneously detect disruptions at both network and local levels, and they typically struggle with incomplete traffic data, which is a common issue during extreme events. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Self-Imputing Deep Multitask Sequence (SI-DMSeq) model for dual-level traffic monitoring and disruption detection. The model simultaneously performs two distinct tasks: (1) reconstructing sequences of traffic data, which enables anomaly detection through an autoencoder-based approach, and (2) making one-step-ahead predictions, which serves to impute missing data for the subsequent time step. To support robust training despite data gaps, we incorporate an iterative imputation strategy during the training phase. During inference, the reconstruction task is used to detect traffic disruptions at both network and local levels, while the prediction task provides reliable imputation of missing values under typical traffic conditions. We evaluate the SI-DMSeq model using historical traffic data from the Manhattan road network in New York City, focusing on disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Christmas blizzard in 2010. The results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately identifies disruptions at both the network and local levels and efficiently imputes missing traffic data.},

  abstract     = {Wireless power transfer offers safe, convenient, and efficient way of charging electric vehicles. Ongoing research is targeting wireless charging pad design optimization; designing the magnetic component is the most important part of the coupler design because the magnetic part determines the coupling factor and efficiency. Optimizing the coil layout and geometry as well as ferrite design requires finite elements analysis based modeling and simulation for minimized core losses, maximized magnetic coupling, and minimized material use for cost-effectiveness. Although parametric finite element analysis or emerging artificial intelligence methods can generate very accurate results, simulation times are extremely long. To address this issue, this study proposes a simple, effective core design called A TOpographic Mapping (ATOM). The proposed design is based on the design of magnetic core by using the magnetic flux distribution. The thickness of the core increases with increasing magnetic flux density, forming a variable thickness core design with less material and minimized core losses compared to conventional designs. A superimposing method is used to create an optimal design for a rotational magnetic field-based system. According to simulation results, the ATOM design reduces the required material volume by 13.19% and yields the lowest core loss and highest mutual inductance compared to other designs. In addition, misalignment, electromagnetic interference, and thermal performance were evaluated for the proposed design.},

This study proposes a novel evaluation framework that applies a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology, specifically the hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to assess and rank LLMs based on five key trust dimensions: fairness, robustness, integrity, explainability, and safety. Drawing from expert evaluations, the framework systematically determines the relative importance of each criterion and applies a weighted scoring approach to compare seven leading LLMs, including both proprietary models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 and open-source models such as Llama 3.1, Mistral Large 2 and DeepSeek V3. Results reveal GPT-4o as the most trustworthy model, significantly outperforming its peers, particularly in robustness and fairness. Open-source models showed lower scores, especially in safety and explainability, highlighting persistent gaps in their alignment with trust expectations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in capturing expert uncertainty and prioritizing trust criteria, offering a robust and adaptable framework for evaluating LLMs in dynamic and sensitive domains.},

To improve accuracy and data diversity, two well-known datasets—PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 and CirCor 2022—were fused after resampling and label harmonization. ML algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM, and DL algorithms like CNN+BiLSTM Attention and CBAM ResNet were incorporated to train the models leveraging the Mel-frequency ceptral coefficients as key acoustic features. Evaluation was performed using the stratified k-fold cross-validation with bootstrapping utilized multiple orthogonal metrics like sensitivity, specificity, F1- score, ROC-AUC alongside accuracy computed over all folds. The results analysis revealed 95.21% accuracy for the ResNet + CBAM model the best performers followed by CNN + BiLSTM at 94.01%. While ML models provided quicker inference and interpretability, DL models exhibited better generalization as well as greater sensitivity to intricate HS, particularly the quadruple rhythm.

As a low-resource language, Assamese encounters specific challenges such dialectal differences, incorrect spellings, frequent code-mixing with English, and a lack of resources with annotations. A custom-built dataset of 100,000 Assamese social media comments was gathered and split equally between toxic and non-toxic categories in order to solve the lack of labelled data. The article presents a multi-layer hybrid deep learning model that integrates multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and bidirectional GRU (BiGRU). A thorough grid search utilising several optimisers and activation functions was used to create and optimise two hybrid architectures: CNN-BiLSTM-BiGRU and BiGRU-BiLSTM-CNN. Among them, the CNN-BiLSTM-BiGRU model outperformed present approaches for Assamese and other structurally related languages, reaching 94.25% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.93%. This work not only produces strong analytical findings, but it also makes a novel contribution in developing and evaluating models for Assamese toxic comment detection under real-world linguistic and resource constraints, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights for furthering NLP research in other under resourced languages.},

Conventional methods for BWD determination are often time-consuming, destructive, and costly, necessitating the development of faster and more economical alternatives. In this study, multispectral imaging was employed to estimate the BWD of Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus oocarpa. A MAPIR Survey3 (RGNIR) camera was used to capture images of 142 wood samples at four drying stages: saturated, naturally drying, equilibrium moisture content, and oven-dry. Reflectance data were extracted using ENVI Classic software, while statistical correlations were analyzed in Minitab 16. Machine learning models—Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine for Regression (SMOreg)—were implemented in Weka 3.8.6. Reflectance in the cross-sectional plane, particularly in the red spectral band, exhibited the highest correlation with BWD. The Random Forest model outperformed other approaches, achieving correlation coefficients exceeding 71% (percentage split) and 65% (cross-validation), with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 14% and 15%, respectively. The MLP, SMOreg, and Linear Regression models also demonstrated satisfactory performance, particularly for saturated wood samples. These findings confirm the viability of multispectral imaging as a rapid, non-destructive, cost-effective, and easily applicable method for BWD estimation in forestry applications.},

The input and output of UNet++ were defined as the t-d and FD vertical magnetic field data derived from a one-dimensional (1-D) geoelectric model, respectively. The dataset consisted of 500,000 samples, encompassing 1-D models with 2 to 6 layers. Through this process, the hyperparameters characterizing the mapping relationship between t-d and FD magnetic fields were determined. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, 20 models were randomly selected from the test dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the theoretical FD responses agree well with the recovered FD responses transformed from the t-d signals via TFC, with a relative error of less than 5% for all frequencies. In addition, the algorithm was tested on an H-type model to demonstrate its superiority over the regularization inversion method in achieving precise TFC. To further validate the effectiveness of TFC for TEM data using UNet++, the algorithm was applied to measured data collected from a mining area in western Qinghai Province, China. The results indicate that reliable FD EM responses can be obtained from t-d signals using UNet++ across all frequencies.

In terms of input, the traditional complex manual feature extraction process is bypassed, and only normalized PRI sequences, frequency sequences, and their first-order difference sequences are used, significantly simplifying the input data. Regarding network architecture, the method combines the temporal modeling ability of LSTM with the global representation strength of Transformer, while also constructing a dual-branch framework and introducing a gated adaptive feature fusion mechanism to enhance feature representation and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in recognition accuracy, fine-grained classification, and noise robustness, highlighting its robustness and practical application value in complex electromagnetic environments.},

Based on the Biot-Savart law, this paper derives the analytical solution for the induced electromotive force of the HFCT under eccentric conditions of the current-carrying conductor. A finite element model of the HFCT and current-carrying conductor was established using the Ansys Maxwell module to perform coupled magnetic circuit simulations. The conductor eccentricity was introduced to investigate the impact of conductor position on the transfer impedance of the HFCT. The research results indicate that the presence of the air gap leads to magnetic field leakage and uneven distribution, increasing measurement errors. The transfer impedance error is only related to the ratio of the inner and outer radii of the coil and the size of the air gap. The smaller the air gap, the less its impact on the transfer impedance verification results. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of transfer impedance verification for the HFCT.},

As machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) emerge as new tools in cryptanalysis, assessing cipher resilience against such techniques has become essential. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of ZUC’s robustness against ML-Based attacks using keystream instances generated through real-world 5G testing infrastructure. Different attack strategies are implemented, including bitwise machine learning prediction, entropy and randomness analysis, Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based reconstruction, protocol metadata fusion, reinforcement learning-based refinement, and statistical correlation modeling. Our results demonstrate that despite extensive AI-based cryptanalysis efforts, ZUC maintains a high security margin, prediction accuracies from baseline models remain below 58.03%, a metric that establishes the cipher’s resilience rather than indicating a practical weakness. Entropy analysis further confirms near-ideal randomness. Minor bit position variations and metadata correlations were observed, which did not significantly impact overall security. These findings establish ZUC’s strong resistance against contemporary AI-based threats and offer critical insights for designing future AI-resilient cryptographic standards in 5G and beyond.},

  abstract     = {In high-mobility scenarios envisioned for 6G communications, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes. To address the parameter estimation problem in OTFS-integrated radar and communication systems, we propose a two-stage parameter estimation framework based on sparse reconstruction and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers-Newton (ADMM-Newton), which exploits the sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to enable precise parameter estimation in high-mobility scenarios. In the first step, we construct an echo signal model for an OTFS-integrated radar-communication system and estimate the delay and Doppler integer grid values of the detected targets using a sparse reconstruction-based ADMM algorithm. In the second step, the estimates of the integer grid parameters are used as constraints for a more specific search. Fractional-precision estimations of the range and velocity parameters are obtained by iteratively solving for the Newton direction via the Newton algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are executed to verify the proposed algorithm’s performance in parameter estimation in ISAC systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves millimeter-level accuracy in velocity estimation under single-target simulation scenarios. Particularly in situations involving multiple sensing targets, the proposed method can estimate target range and velocity with centimeter-level accuracy. The proposed algorithm effectively eliminates notable differences between estimated and real values due to three targets interfering with one another, demonstrating strong estimation accuracy. Furthermore, in target conditions that are closely spaced, the proposed algorithm maintains robust estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) has been extensively utilized in the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technology in the coal industry. However, there existed uncertainty about whether mainstream algorithms can effectively and accurately identify rock strength across diverse geological conditions. Therefore, this study compared the effects of the three mainstream algorithms, K-means clustering, BP neural network, and SVM classification, to clarify the geological conditions suitable for each algorithm, and finally proposed the optimal selection and application methods of various algorithms under different geological conditions. The study revealed that the accuracy for K-means clustering, BP neural networks, and SVM multi-label classification algorithms were 85%~88%, 92%~96%, and 89%~92% respectively. Additionally, BP neural networks, SVM multi-label classification, and SVM single-label classification are suitable under conditions where strength differences are less than 6.3 MPa, between 6.3 MPa and 22.7 MPa, and greater than 22.7 MPa, and their generalization rates are 98.12%, 98.48%, and 94.71%, respectively. K-means clustering is appropriate for the preliminary identification of strata information in scenarios with few rock types and simple existing conditions. At the same time, BP neural networks and SVM multi-label classification are well-suited for strata characterized by “multiple rock types and low strength differences.” In contrast, SVM single-label classification is more suitable for strata featuring “few rock types and high strength differences”, which would hold significant practical value in enhancing the applicability of ML for MWD technology in coal mines.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression synthesis for video sequences presents significant challenges in terms of maintaining temporal coherence while preserving identity and expression accuracy. Most current approaches primarily focus on individual frame quality. This results in videos with unnatural transitions, flickering artifacts, and inconsistent expression dynamics. This paper presents a novel method for improving temporal coherence in facial expression image-to-video synthesis. The proposed approach uses a dual-focus framework that explicitly models both pixel-level transitions and geometric consistency between consecutive frames. Our method includes two specialized loss functions: a frame difference loss and a landmark consistency loss. We also implement a two-stage training strategy and a frame-blending post-processing technique. Extensive testing on the MUG Facial Expression Database demonstrates that the enhanced-coherence approach outperforms baseline methods and competes with other approaches from the literature. The proposed method has the lowest Average Content Distance score of all the approaches tested. This indicates smoother frame transitions while maintaining high visual quality. Subjective evaluation with 140 participants confirms that the synthesized expressions are more realistic and expressive. Our approach outperformed real videos in recognition rates for certain emotion expressions, particularly disgust and sadness. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of explicitly modeling temporal coherence in generating realistic facial expression videos. This has promising applications in therapy, entertainment, and human-computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer science, engineering technology, and occupational therapy faculty and students focused on improving the lives of children with disabilities. In the spring of 2023, an occupational therapy student was approached by a friend of a young boy who had lost both of his legs due to infection to see if she knew of anyone who could adapt his drivable car to hand controls. A group of students from the Innovators and Makers Club and occupational therapy program met together to adapt the car. Funded by monies from the College of Innovation and Technology, the car was adapted with hand controls and the young boy was able to have his car for the summer. The authors completed virtual interviews with the students involved in the process in Fall 2023. The students shared their views on this uncommon learning exercise and how they thought the experience may enhance their careers. The information provided by the initial group of students allowed the car to be brought back to campus in Winter 2024 and students from Digital Manufacturing Technology & Automation and Occupational Therapy worked together in combined class times to further adapt the car. The collaboration between two distinct disciplines, DMT (Digital, Manufacturing, and Automation) and OT (Occupational Therapy), to enhance the design and functionality of a car represents a groundbreaking approach to problem-solving and innovation. By merging their diverse expertise, these classes are able to tackle challenges from multiple angles, incorporating both technical and human-centric perspectives. This interdisciplinary collaboration fosters creativity and encourages outside-the-box thinking, leading to more comprehensive solutions that address not only the technical aspects of car design but also considerations of usability, accessibility, and user experience. By bridging the gap between engineering technology and healthcare, this innovative partnership demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving forward progress and creating products that better serve the needs of diverse populations. In summer 2024, students from Occupational Therapy and the Maker’s Club came together to modify four cars for children from Early On. Students completed survey in fall 2024 that provided opportunities to further improve the project. Currently, students in DMT and OT are adapting 6 additional cars for children with disabilities. In winter 2025, six cars were adapted by DMT and OT students through combined course activities. In concert, the professional development component of these activities helps validate several of the concepts presented in both courses. Just as importantly, employers are seeking candidates who possess these real world experiences and working knowledge.},

  abstract     = {For open vocabulary recognition of ingredients in food images, segmenting the ingredients is a crucial step. This paper proposes a novel approach that explores latent feature representations of image pixels via a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance ingredient segmentation. An internal clustering metric based on the silhouette score is defined to evaluate the clustering quality of various pixel-level feature representations generated by different feature maps derived from various CNN backbones. Using this metric, the paper explores the most suitable feature representations and clustering methods for ingredient segmentation. Additionally, it is found that principle component (PC)-driven latent feature presentations of pixels derived from concatenations of backbone feature maps improve the clustering quality of them, resulting in stable segmentation outcomes. Notably, the number of selected eigenvalues can be used as the number of clusters to achieve good segmentation results. The proposed method is validated on widely used public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performances. Importantly, the proposed segmentation method is unsupervised, and pixel-level feature representations from backbones are not fine-tuned on specific datasets. This demonstrates the flexibility, generalizability, and interpretability of the proposed method, while reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases globally, where early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Although deep learning and digital pathology have advanced lesion classification performance, significant challenges remain due to complex histopathological patterns, privacy concerns over centralized data storage, and inconsistencies across datasets in terms of annotation, quality, and structure. These disparities hinder model generalization and complicate performance benchmarking. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a novel skin lesion classification framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with Vision Transformers (ViTs). FL enables decentralized model training across multiple clinical sites without sharing sensitive data, inherently accommodating data heterogeneity while preserving privacy. ViTs, with their self-attention mechanisms, effectively capture global contextual features, making them robust to structural and visual variations in non-standardized datasets. The framework incorporates key components such as client-side preprocessing, data augmentation, federated transfer learning, model aggregation, and feature optimization. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on two publicly available skin lesion datasets—HAM10000 and ISIC2019. The proposed model achieved a global test accuracy of 90%, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 91.4% on the HAM10000 dataset. On the ISIC2019 dataset, the model attained a test accuracy of 87.6%, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values reaching 0.96 for the best-performing class, demonstrating strong discriminative ability. These results confirm the framework’s robustness in real-world scenarios with non indentical data and its potential to support privacy-preserving, scalable clinical applications in dermatology. This work contributes to advancing FL-based computer vision solutions for skin cancer detection and lays the groundwork for future exploration of ViTs in decentralized healthcare environments.},

However, the continuous movement of satellites causes periodic transitions between the sunlit and shadowed regions of orbit, leading to fluctuations in available energy. Satellites on the sunlit side can harvest solar energy to recharge their batteries, while those in the shadowprimarily rely on stored battery power. This paper presents a joint task and energy allocation framework that optimizes satellite energy consumption by considering three key factors: onboard processing of small tasks, relaying tasks to sunlit satellites for processing, and offloading larger tasks to ground stations when available. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is employed to determine the optimal energy distribution across these tasks, while a computationally efficient greedy algorithm is introduced as an alternative. Additionally, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is incorporated to optimize the energy consumption during task processing by adjusting the processing frequency according to the available energy. The results indicate that ILP achieves optimal energy efficiency, while the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution with only a 4.4% deviation.},

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid system leveraging Docker containers, the Moleculer framework, and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) to enable semantic interoperability while quantifying communication latencies in bidirectional industrial workflows, analyzing microservice communication performance in edge platforms through a hybrid architecture that combines legacy protocols with edge virtualization, and contextualizing it against fieldbus-based systems and fully virtualized containerized microservices. Experimental validation on a Siemens S7-1500 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) evaluates latency distributions across architectures, revealing average round-trip times of 7.23 ms for hybrid sensor updates and 5.94 ms for virtualized command writes, with 75% of operations under 10 ms. Performance tradeoffs emerge between protocol translation overhead in hybrid systems and transporter-induced variability in virtual deployments. By correlating temporal metrics with architectural choices, this work provides actionable insights for modernizing brownfield installations, enabling manufacturers to select optimal strategies based on legacy constraints and real-time requirements.

However, wind‑induced movements cause antenna misalignment and unbalanced user distributions, leading to throughput degradation. This work presents a low‑complexity, equal clustering (EC) ‑aided deep Q‑network (DQN) algorithm for dynamic antenna control in HAPS networks. The proposed EC algorithm partitions users into balanced clusters by identifying low‑density sectors in a single pass, avoiding the iterative refinements of other clustering algorithms such as K‑Means. A DQN then fine-tunes the antenna tilt angles and beam widths based on the EC results to maximize the throughput of low‑throughput users. The proposed method’s performance is evaluated through simulations under rotation and shift scenarios and benchmarked against three Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches and a K-Means clustering baseline. Compared with these methods, the EC-aided DQN delivers higher throughput, especially for users in the low-throughput tail, while reducing computational complexity. For instance, the percentage of low-throughput users was reduced by over 10% in the case of 5 km shift in the regions of Osaka and Sendai, compared to K-means. Similarly, in the case of 30° rotation, the percentage is reduced by 4.1% and 6.5% for the same regions. Statistical significance tests confirm that the improvements are not due to random simulation noise.},

Traditional digital signatures, though foundational for authentication, are often infeasible for low-end devices with limited computational, memory, and energy resources. Also, the rise of quantum computing necessitates post-quantum (PQ) secure alternatives. However, NIST-standardized PQ signatures impose substantial overhead, limiting their practicality in energy-sensitive applications such as wearables, where signer-side efficiency is critical. To address these challenges, we present LightQSign (LiteQS), a novel lightweight PQ signature that achieves near-optimal signature generation efficiency with only a small, constant number of hash operations per signing. Its core innovation enables verifiers to obtain one-time hash-based public keys without interacting with signers or third parties through secure computation. We formally prove the security of LiteQS in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance on commodity hardware and a resource-constrained 8-bit AtMega128A1 microcontroller. Experimental results show that LiteQS outperforms NIST PQ standards with lower computational overhead, minimal memory usage, and compact signatures. On an 8-bit microcontroller, it achieves up to 1.5–24× higher energy efficiency and 1.7–22× shorter signatures than PQ counterparts, and 56–76× better energy efficiency than conventional standards–enabling longer device lifespans and scalable, quantum-resilient authentication.},

In response to the above shortcomings, this paper establishes a two-stage WTA model for a more complex scenario. In this model, a complex network-based assessment method is introduced and applied to better quantify the damage degree of targets, a method for calculating the probability of a target being destroyed when struck by multiple weapons is proposed, and the stage division significantly reduced the dimension of the optimization model. A Monte Carlo tree search enhanced by a metaheuristic algorithm and a memetic algorithm with a coevolution mechanism are used to solve two sub-models of the two-stage WTA model, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the two targeted heuristic algorithms can produce better solutions than similar heuristic algorithms, and the WTA model proposed in this paper is applicable to complex scenarios involving dynamic hit probabilities and heterogeneous targets.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces an AI-driven outdoor object detection system aimed at enhancing navigation for visually impaired individuals (VIIs). VIIs often face significant challenges in accessing and interpreting visual information. Recent advancements in computer hardware and deep learning techniques have led to notable progress in developing assistive technologies for VIIs. However, existing datasets often focus on single scenarios and lack sufficient annotations to represent the diverse obstacles encountered in real-world settings. This limitation hinders the development of comprehensive object detection systems tailored to the needs of VIIs. The system utilizes advanced models such as YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), YOLOv9c, and YOLOv10n, with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules trained on the WOTR dataset, which includes 20 classes of common outdoor objects. A comparative study evaluated the performance of these models across key metrics. The YOLOv8m model demonstrated balanced performance with an accuracy of 85.53. YOLOv8n showed slightly lower performance, with an accuracy of 77.05%, and the YOLOv8s model recorded an accuracy of 84.99%, precision and recall of 0.99, 0.89, matching YOLOv8n with an F1 score of 0.74. Similarly, YOLOv9c achieved an accuracy of 79.82%, and the proposed YOLOv10n model with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules led with the highest accuracy of 89.33%, precision and recall of 0.99, 0.92, with F1 score of 0.79. A comparative analysis revealed that the proposed YOLOv10n with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules achieved the highest accuracy with precision and recall indicating its reliability for assistive applications. In the realm of assistive technologies, similar AI-powered devices have been developed to aid visually impaired individuals. These innovations, alongside the described object detection system, exemplify the potential of AI in creating inclusive solutions that empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their environments more safely and independently.},

  abstract     = {Performance deviation of inverters in grid-connected distributed energy resource systems, due to component degradation from environmental stressors, is a major reliability concern. This work presents a data-driven digital twin (DT) of an H-bridge inverter with output filtering, developed using physics-informed machine learning (PIML). A ‘switching’ digital model is created using experimental data collected from the inverter prototype and optimized via particle swarm optimization. Later, continuous degradation is introduced to filter parameters, including parasitic resistances and the aging/reliability factor in filter components, generating a comprehensive dataset for training supervised ML models, for fast, accurate degradation estimation. To account for real-world conditions, measurement noise—such as ripple and ground loop effects—is introduced for capacitor parasitic resistance. In this scenario, the proposed PIML-DT approach, enhanced with a modified loss function and physical constraints, accurately estimates capacitor equivalent series resistance despite partial and noisy measurement data. It achieves an R2 of 0.6918 and RMSE of 0.0053, demonstrating strong resilience to noise and effective tracking of inverter degradation. This PIML-DT approach supports reliable, data-driven condition monitoring and long-term health assessment of power electronic converters.},

It is a recyclable resource and an essential substitute for iron ore as a raw material. The accuracy of classification is hampered by the limits of current scrap steel recognition techniques, which include limited category coverage, small-target detection capabilities, and resistance to background interference. This research suggests YOLO-SSNP, a dense, small-target scrap steel material detection algorithm created by improving the YOLOv5 framework, as a solution to these issues. To improve the model’s ability to extract fine-grained features, a small-target detection head is first included. Second, to maximize feature representation while preserving model compactness, GSConv and VoVGSCSP are used to build a Slim-Neck module, which replaces conventional Conv and C3 modules in parts of the Neck layer. Finally, Soft-NMS replaces traditional NMS to enhance recognition accuracy for occluded and overlapping targets. The model is trained and evaluated on a self-constructed scrap steel image dataset and compared against several mainstream detection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate thatYOLO-SSNP offers superior accuracy and model compactness, with a precision (P) value of 97.9% and an mAP of 89.7%. It highlights the model’s efficacy in precisely and efficiently identifying the different types of scrap steel material by improving the mAP value by 28.6% and 17.8%, respectively, over earlier methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately valuing demand-side flexibility hinges on two tightly coupled tasks: reconstructing the customer baseline load (CBL) that would have occurred in the absence of demand-response (DR) events and, from that baseline, forecasting the flexibility of load that can be curtailed. Existing studies usually treat these problems in isolation and often depend on appliance-level datasets that are rarely available at scale. This paper proposes DualDRNet, a unified deep learning framework that converts one-dimensional smart-meter load data into frequency-aware 2-D tensors, then captures intra-period and inter-period dynamics through a CNN–Transformer vision backbone. CBL estimation is cast as a masked-imputation task, where DR intervals are treated as missing values and the model learns the missing patterns mimicking CBL. DR Potential forecasting is addressed with the same network, trained autoregressively for multi-horizon prediction. The model is evaluated on the Low Carbon London dataset comprising half-hourly readings from 10% households exposed to 77 peak shaving and 81 valley filling DR events. DualDRNet lowers CBL root-mean-square error (RMSE) to 0.715 kW, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to 6.9%, outperforming both averaging and deep learning based CBL estimation baselines. For aggregated DR Potential forecasting, it sustains accurate performance from five- to nine-day horizons, delivering lowest RMSE and MAPE relative to state-of-the-art temporal convolutional, hierarchical interpolation and Transformer variants. By coupling baseline reconstruction and flexibility forecasting in a single architecture with near-identical hyper-parameters, DualDRNet offers load aggregators a practical, end-to-end solution for day-ahead market bidding without the need for intrusive sub-metering. Future work will extend the approach to mixed commercial–industrial portfolios and explore parameter-efficient CNN-Transformer variants suitable for edge deployment where computational requirements are more stringent.},

Nevertheless, along with the unwrapping performance improvement of deep networks, their structures become more and more complicated and diverse. As a result, these designed networks make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. For this purpose, we proposed a lightweight neural network for efficient 2d phase unwrapping (EPUN). EPUN first introduces a feature modulation block to efficiently aggregate long-range spatial context while executing channel mixing on the features. In addition, we design a feature supervision module exclusively used during training, which provides explicit unwrapping supervision for deep-level features, facilitating the network to converge to a better parameter set for optimized phase unwrapping performance. We evaluate EPUN qualitatively and quantitatively on both simulation and real data. The experimental results show that EPUN not only achieves optimal unwrapping performance but also has excellent unwrapping speed.},

To solve the existing problems and challenges, this study proposes a Kinective-Journey YOLO (KJ-YOLO) target detection algorithm customized for target detection in complex environments. It uses the idea of cascaded feature pyramids to enhance the expression ability of feature maps through an attention mechanism and feature weighting to realize a more complex feature fusion mechanism: the Scale Balancing Aggregation Module (SBA Module). It improves C3k2 through an intelligent segmentation and reorganization mechanism of feature channels and residual cross-layer connections to achieve feature reuse, thereby reducing computational complexity and improving the C3K2-DEConv module of small-target feature extraction. The feature extraction and fusion of small and multi-scale targets are improved, and the lightweight downsampling module Adown is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the model. A large number of experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 public dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, KJ-YOLO's 'mAP' index rate is increased by 3.3% to 67.3%, and mAP50-95 is increased by 2.3% to 44.8%.

Traditional approaches struggle to (1) extract meaningful patterns from sparse, high-dimensional behavioral data, (2) efficiently cluster users with similar preferences, and (3) generate personalized recommendations that balance individual tastes with broader community trends. We propose a scalable graph-based framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, our hierarchical feature learning system processes diverse behavioral signals - including preferred product categories, dress colors, and visual styles - using weakly supervised learning to ensure comprehensive preference coverage. Second, a geometric selection strategy filters noisy features, producing compact yet expressive user representations that are projected into a latent topic space for precise differentiation. Third, we construct a weighted user similarity graph enabling efficient community detection at scale, revealing preference patterns ranging from bold aesthetics to minimalist styles. The complete pipeline integrates these components with a ranking module that fuses individual user profiles with community embeddings, achieving personalized recommendations that reflect both specific user behaviors and broader preference trends. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of over one million users demonstrate our framework’s superiority in both clustering quality (28% higher NMI than baseline methods) and recommendation accuracy (15% improvement in recall@k), while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment.},

  abstract     = {System identification is essential for modeling and control of nonlinear dynamic systems. In practice, traditional linear or unidirectional recurrent models often fail to capture the oscillatory, speed-dependent behaviors of highly nonlinear processes such as dual double-acting piston pumps (DDAPPs). Recent advances in deep learning highlight the potential of recurrent neural networks; however, most studies rely on unidirectional LSTMs and neglect the benefits of bidirectional processing and ensemble learning. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an ensemble bidirectional long short–term memory (EnBiLSTM) framework for identifying a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) of the DDAPP. Specifically, the proposed method employs bidirectional temporal encoding to exploit both past and future sequence information, while ensemble averaging enhances generalization and robustness. Furthermore, a hybrid multi-objective optimization strategy integrating Pareto front analysis and TOPSIS is employed to determine the optimal system order, balancing prediction accuracy and model complexity. Regarding the scenario experiments, the proposed EnBiLSTM reduces prediction error, yielding RMSE reductions of approximately 80%, 66%, and 96% compared to GRU, SVM, and ARIMA, and achieves an RMSE of 11.9, an MAE of 8.4, and an R² of 0.92. Apart from that, the EnBiLSTM model is also characterized by low inference latency of approximately 16.5 ms and moderate resource utilization, justifying its deployability in real-time. As a result, it impressed EnBiLSTM as an appropriate and robust solution for nonlinear system identification with significant gains in predictive accuracy and practicability.},

We then apply face trackers and calculate the mean shape of extracted landmarks in each image. Lastly, we estimate the head pose with the iterative closest point method. For facial landmarks, we performed experiments on 406 images from publicly available datasets. For the four investigated face trackers, our proposed pipeline was able to reduce the landmark detection error by at least 2-3 times, with a reduction in average detection error from 14.0 pixels to 3.9 pixels. For head pose estimation, we performed experiments on different views of a 3D head model with head pose ranges from -60° to 60° and 2D face images. Across more than 3,300 occluded test images, the proposed pipeline obtained a head pose within 10° of the ground truth in most cases. In conclusion, we present a system that enhances the accuracy of facial landmark detection and head pose estimation under large occlusions, without training any new machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity and dynamism of modern computational environments demand more adaptive and intelligent methodologies for strategic decision-making, especially in multi-agent systems. These systems, consisting of multiple autonomous agents interacting in shared environments, pose challenges that traditional models struggle to address. Conventional approaches to strategy optimization in game-theoretic contexts typically rely on static models and predefined payoff matrices. While effective in controlled settings, these models lack the flexibility to reflect the adaptive and interactive behavior of agents in real-world scenarios. They often ignore bounded rationality, where agents have limited knowledge or computational resources, and thus fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic environments. In contrast, emerging techniques such as reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and stochastic games offer more dynamic and responsive alternatives. These approaches can adapt to changing conditions, learn from interactions, and generalize across different strategic contexts. They provide a more accurate reflection of real-world scenarios where agents must constantly revise strategies based on limited or evolving information. Such advanced methodologies are critical for practical applications in areas like autonomous systems, economic modeling, distributed control, and cybersecurity. They enable the development of systems capable of robust decision-making in uncertain, multi-agent environments. Embracing these innovations will be key to addressing the limitations of static models and realizing the full potential of intelligent computational strategies in dynamic and complex systems.},

Classical cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES, asymmetric schemes such as RSA and ECC, and essential primitives like hash functions and the One-Time Pad (OTP), have been the cornerstone of secure digital communication since their inception. However, the progress of quantum algorithms, spearheaded by Shor and Grover, poses serious threats to these schemes, necessitating a shift in cryptographic design. This paper presents an all-encompassing review of classical cryptographic techniques, along with emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that have been developed to provide quantum-resistant security while maintaining compatibility with classical infrastructure. Concurrently, the quantum key distribution (QKD) introduces a radical shift, leveraging quantum mechanics principles to attain unconditional security. This paper elaborates both Discrete Variable (DV-QKD) and Continuous Variable (CV-QKD) approaches, highlighting their operational principles and security models. By providing a relative analysis of classical cryptographic methods, PQC, and quantum cryptography, including QKD protocols and quantum-safe primitives, this work targets to provide a consolidated insight into modern cryptographic landscape and further research toward secure communication in the quantum era.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems convert spoken words into text and play a critical role in voice assistants, transcription services, and other accessibility tools. However, their reliance on machine learning models makes them susceptible to adversarial attacks. By adding small, often imperceptible perturbations to the input audio, or by convolving it with a carefully designed room impulse response, attackers can cause ASR systems to produce incorrect or even malicious transcripts. In this work, we propose an ensemble detection method for the efficient identification of targeted adversarial attacks in ASR systems. Specifically, we introduce MELo-FEST, which calculates the minimum energy in the low-frequency band of an audio signal to detect convolutive adversarial attacks. We then combine two spectrogram-based detection methods with a noise-adding approach to form an ensemble detector capable of identifying both additive and convolutive targeted adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed ensemble detector can accurately identify adversarial audio generated by both non-adaptive and adaptive CW, PGD, and AdvReverb attacks in Wav2Vec2 and Whisper ASR systems, achieving an F1 score of at least 0.97. Moreover, our method performs both speech recognition and adversarial detection for each input audio sample in an average of under 0.13 seconds for Wav2Vec2 and 0.29 seconds for Whisper, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Additionally, we find that Whisper is more vulnerable than Wav2Vec2 to both non-adaptive and adaptive targeted adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Vascular access dysfunction is a prevalent and critical complication among hemodialysis patients, particularly in Taiwan, which has the highest proportion of dialysis patients globally. Early diagnosis and effective management are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic approaches, such as routine surveillance and fixed blood flow thresholds, often fail to reliably identify patients requiring timely surgical intervention. To address these challenges, this study proposes a trustworthy AI system utilizing an uncertainty-aware, tree-based machine learning framework to improve the assessment of vascular access dysfunction. The proposed framework incorporates advanced uncertainty management techniques to address both aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty) originating from inherent data variability, and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) arising from model limitations. Aleatoric uncertainty is systematically quantified using a multipass perturbation strategy that simulates sample variability to capture the distribution of potential outcomes, while epistemic uncertainty is mitigated using ensemble methods. By leveraging the multipass perturbation strategy, the framework generates calibrated uncertainty estimations. To increase the reliability and trustworthiness of clinical decision-making, the framework assigns low-confidence (high-uncertainty) predictions to an ‘Uncertain’ category, thereby achieving a near-zero leakage rate, which is crucial in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Additionally, an extended confusion matrix and novel uncertainty metrics are introduced to comprehensively evaluate model performance. The system has been validated using real-world hospital datasets, demonstrating its deployable AI potential with superior predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness compared to traditional methods such as the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines.},

  abstract     = {In most cases, the soil resistivity in oil onshore sites is low due to its structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the sea or to use water in extracting oil and gas according to the technologies used in that. In this article simplified approach for the grounding grid design of an oil onshore site is proposed. The onshore site is divided into seven zones, each has its own grounding grid. The paper used a simplified formula in combination with FEM simulations using COMSOL and CYMGrd that provides a comprehensive technical approach in the design of an oil onshore grounding system. Empirical data from an actual onshore site enhances the applicability of the research. Standards such as IEEE 80, NEC 70, and IEC-60364 are well-integrated in the design methodology. Key improvements include reducing maximum values of the step and touch potentials to be in the ranges of 100 and 590 volts, respectively, while the surface potential is reduced to 600 volts, which are considered safe values according to IEC-60364 standards, and achieving the grid resistance of each zone to be less than 0.5 ohm. The resultant resistance when connecting the ground grids of the seven zones reached less than 0.01 ohm through optimized electrode arrangements. A 3-D model is used to study the impact of lightning strikes on the tank farm area due to its importance. The proposed approach helps the engineering applications for a well-designed grounding grid in oil onshore sites, which is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation by mitigating electrical hazards and providing a path for fault currents.},

The DCP network, trained on synthetic data, employs attention-based feature embedding and SVD-based soft matching to achieve robust registration under noise and partial overlaps. The interpolation method estimates alignment errors from sparse angular samples, reducing computational cost and data usage by approximately 85%. Comparative experiments against ICP, Go-ICP, FGR, TEASER++, and DCP-only show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy (average error rate 0.029), higher success rates (96%), and stable performance across diverse environments, including low-light and GPS-degraded scenarios.

These conventional approaches often rely on fixed document object model locators, such as XPath or CSS selectors, which are highly sensitive to minor user interface changes. As a result, tests frequently break, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced accessibility for non-technical users. To address these challenges, we propose a unified and lightweight framework that combines a domain-specific restricted natural language for intuitive, high-level test specification, with a vision-language module capable of real-time user interface element detection directly from live screenshots. This eliminates the brittleness of fixed locators and enables robust test execution even under frequent user interface changes. To validate our approach, we implemented and deployed a fully functional prototype, demonstrating that the system can operate efficiently on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on cloud services offering a highly cost-effective solution suitable for enterprise use. A key enabler of our framework is the streamlined dataset construction process: we introduce a hybrid data acquisition strategy that combines automated annotation from large-scale web crawling with a scalable human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining high data quality. Notably, the framework is domain-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other disciplines requiring efficient vision-language fine-tuning, broadening its potential impact beyond web testing. Experimental evaluations show substantial improvements in test robustness, maintenance overhead, and execution efficiency, establishing our framework as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation automated UI testing.},

The dataset comprises 137,432 traffic accident cases collected by the Korean National Police Agency. A total of 1,774 training samples were extracted using term frequency–inverse document frequency keyword analysis. We then evaluated the prediction performance of three large language models (LLM): Claude 3, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o with fine-tuning, using 500 randomly selected traffic accident records that lacked keyword-extractable behavior information. GPT-4o with fine-tuning achieved the highest accuracy of 81.1%. Using this model, 26 functional scenarios were generated. The risk levels for each scenario were evaluated by integrating the equivalent property damage only index with risk predictions from logistic regression and XGBoost models. A weighted average of the normalized results was used to rank the scenarios. Scenarios such as "turning left / crossing," "straight / crossing," and "turning right / crossing" were consistently identified as high-risk.

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection remains a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving due to depth ambiguities and occlusions inherent in single RGB images. While recent transformer-based methods leverage global context via self-attention, they still suffer from limited spatial precision and weak depth supervision. In this paper, we propose an enhanced depth-aware transformer framework (EDATRAF) for monocular 3D object detection. EDATRAF integrates several key components in a depth-aware feature enhancement (DFE) module that fuses RGB and predicted depth features via cross-attention to reduce depth ambiguity. It includes a depth target feature (DTF) volume with instance-aware selective refinement (ISR) to enforce object-level depth consistency through auxiliary volume supervision and foreground-weighted query embeddings combined with cross-query attention (CQA) to enhance query discrimination and representation. To improve training, we design a distance-aware loss weighting scheme and a Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) loss that captures object extent and orientation in the ground plane. Additionally, EDATRAF adopts a multi-scale positional encoding and supports dynamic anchor boxes (DAB) style query initialization for enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that EDATRAF significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of 3D average precision (AP) and BEV intersection over uinon (IoU), particularly in scenes with occlusion, scale variation, and complex spatial layouts. These results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of our approach for real-world autonomous perception.},

To provide meaningful context for the research, Data Distribution Service (DDS) is used as a benchmark, a protocol that has consistently demonstrated strong performance in previous automotive research. The experimental results highlight Zenoh protocol advantages in message delivery integrity and resource efficiency, especially in scenarios with high data transmission frequency.

In spite of the advent of low precision data formats such as brain floating point 16-bit (bfloat16), the amount of data processed in DNN models is still increasing due to an increasingly growing parameter size. To this end, data reduction with efficient processing is crucial for the real-world deployment of the DNN models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight customized brain floating-point (bfloat) format, which is derived from bfloat16 data format. Based on our observation from the pre-trained weights, we reduce the size of each bfloat16 weight element up to 9-bit by using the fixed exponents and truncating the mantissa bits. For efficient processing of our lightweight customized bfloat format, we also propose dual-MAC hardware architecture, which enables up to 2× better throughput when processing our proposed format as compared to the case when processing the conventional bfloat16 format. We devise a novel processing element architecture for systolic arrays by utilizing the lookup table (LUT) for multiplication operations between the fixed exponent bits and a part of mantissa bits. Our PE architecture also enables a versatile processing for both the conventional bfloat16 and our customized bfloat formats. According to our evaluation results across the six widely used DNN models, our customized bfloat format results in 37.95% data reduction, on average, as compared to the conventional bfloat16 format with only small accuracy losses. In terms of performance, our dual-MAC hardware with the customized bfloat format leads to better performance by 56.2% as compared to using the conventional systolic array with the conventional bfloat16 format. Our dual-MAC hardware also leads to better performance-energy trade-offs due to better performance even with increased power consumption of our dual-MAC hardware.},

  abstract     = {Smooth and distortion-free torque is one of the most important characteristics of instantaneous torque in the hybrid vehicle. In this paper, the instantaneous torque is firstly calculated by solving Maxwell's equations which are partial differential equations. The general solution is determined by a separate variable method. They include two variables in radial and tangential directions. Consequently, they require two types of boundary and interface conditions in mentioned directions for assigning integral constants. Then, the impact of the pole arc to pole pitch ratio, slot-opening size, air gap radius and the integral and fractional slot structures are separately examined to reduce torque ripple. Additionally, magnetization pattern plays an important role in the magnetic field and instantaneous torque. Three magnetization patterns including radial, parallel and 9-segment magnetization patterns are introduced and assessed. Next, considering the effect of the aforementioned factors, an optimal structure that has the least distortion will be proposed so that the torque fluctuations are in acceptable range. After that, cogging, reluctance, electromagnetic and instantaneous torque are calculated. It is also important to remember that, Back-EMF (based on flux path in teeth for two types winding consist of alternate-teeth and all-teeth non-overlapping winding) and Torque-Speed characteristics are computed for the presented hybrid vehicle. Finally, the impact of the temperature on the all torque component, induced voltage magnitude as well as Torque-speed chart of hybrid vehicles based on the response of Maxwell's equations are determined. The model computations have been performed with Matlab software.},

Addressing challenges like extensive computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three TL strategies—full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from scratch—using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD, HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset features analysis, data augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and generalizability.},

This challenge is exacerbated when the target animal species are very small, highly similar in appearance, and fast-moving, such as different species of birds. Although deep learning has been extensively applied to classify and detect animal species, bird species are either captured in static, high-quality images under optimal conditions, with no motion blur or other disturbances, or they are grouped into a single class. Real camera trap images, however, are not optimal nor of high quality. Furthermore, recognizing bird species is more detailed and intricate than identifying larger animals such as deer, moose, or reindeer, making manual annotation more time-consuming and susceptible to errors. This study utilizes state-of-the-art deep-learning neural networks to localize and classify hard-to-see bird species in Norwegian wilderness camera trap images. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned YOLOv8x architecture achieved the highest performance for localization, outperforming YOLOv9, yielding a mAP@50 score of 0.92. For the classification of hard-to-distinguish bird species, EfficientNetB7 achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score of 0.87.

  abstract     = {With the transformation of healthcare systems, the aging population, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in the healthcare industry has significantly increased. In particular, demand has grown for personal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring using wearable devices, such as smartwatches. However, these devices usually only record single-lead ECG signals, which are not as accurate for diagnosing cardiac conditions as the standard 12-lead ECGs used in clinical settings. Deep learning models have been actively explored to reconstruct standard 12-lead ECG signals from several leads to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, comprehensive comparative studies on time-series-based deep learning models capable of generating clinically equivalent ECG signals are lacking. In this study, we designed and evaluated three recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU to reconstruct 12-lead ECG signals from a limited subset of leads and compared their reconstruction performance. Each model consists of three RNN layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers. Experimental results on the PTB-XL dataset show that the GRU model achieves the best reconstruction performance, with a PCC of 0.911, MAE of 0.033 and RMSE of 0.065, outperforming Bi-LSTM (PCC: 0.893, MAE: 0.035, RMSE: 0.072) and LSTM (PCC: 0.819, MAE: 0.039, RMSE: 0.088). This study systematically compares the performance of RNN-based models for ECG signal reconstruction and identifies GRU as the most effective architecture for reconstructing standard 12-lead ECGs from single-lead inputs. Due to its relatively lightweight structure, the proposed model shows strong potential for real-time implementation on wearable devices and has valuable implications for mobile healthcare and remote diagnostic systems.},

This paper aims to propose a data-driven ToMFIR (total measurable fault information residual) based active fault detection scheme for incipient faults in the suspension system of CRH (China Railway High-speed) trains. Firstly, based on the train attitude data obtained from sensors, T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy data modeling is performed. Subsequently, ToMFIR residuals are designed on the basis of LQ decomposition and least squares identification techniques. To achieve beneficial proactive amplification of the ToMFIR residuals, auxiliary signals are introduced. Simultaneously, redundant actuators are employed to prevent the auxiliary signals from interfering with normal system operation. Finally, a Hellinger distance-based evaluation function is introduced to monitor changes in the incipient fault indicator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed active fault detection scheme effectively identifies incipient faults in suspension actuators, springs, and dampers.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes the use of a hybrid precopy/postcopy virtual machine (VM) migration framework to aid an autonomous agent when making migration decisions to continuously optimize the balance between the migration time, downtime, and energy consumption. The data center state and the resource load, including the CPU, memory, and network, are represented in the agent's state space using a two-layer graph neural network (GNN), and the asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C) algorithm is employed to dynamically determine whether to continue the precopy phase or switch to postcopy, optimizing the trade-off among the total migration time, downtime, and energy consumption while adhering to the service-level agreement (SLA) constraints. An adaptive host selection policy ensures that VMs are migrated only to underloaded machines, preventing overload and ensuring system stability. A simulation evaluation that employed the VM workload from the GWA-Bitbrains dataset revealed that this framework achieved a total migration time of 45.5 s, with 30.1 s spent on the precopy phase and 15.4 s on the postcopy phase, resulting in a downtime of 15.4 s. Compared with previous approaches, this result represents an improvement of 12.5% in total migration time, reducing it from 52 s to 45.5 s; 23% in downtime reduction, from 20 s to 15.4 s; and 4.4% in energy efficiency, increasing from 87% to 91.4%. The SLA compliance remained stable at 92.8%, affirming that the service quality was preserved. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating GNN-based embeddings and A3C scheduling in terms of reducing downtime and energy usage while maintaining reliable service delivery in data centers.},

  abstract     = {The resonant tank circuit of quasi-resonant converters, which operate based on the resonant switch concept, provides soft switching by shaping the voltage or current of the switch and conducts energy transfer from input to output. Thus, variable frequency switching emerges as a natural control technique. The disadvantage of this technique is that the operating frequency needs to be changed over a wide range to regulate the output power against changing input voltage and output load. As a result, the design of input and output filters becomes difficult, EMI noise increases, and drivers and switches capable of operating at very high frequencies are required. To reduce or eliminate the disadvantages, variable inductor control is proposed for power control of zero voltage switching quasi-resonant buck converter used as an LED driver. The 40W LED driver, with an input voltage ranging from 18V to 25V, is designed to operate at the switching frequency of 150kHz, and its prototype is built. The operating parameters of the variable inductor are determined through finite element analysis. The variable inductor-controlled driver is tested for dynamically changing input voltage and LED module. The test results show that the power switch of the closed-loop controlled driver is turned on under zero voltage conditions against a wide range of varying input voltage, and the LED module current follows the reference current. Test results confirming the validity of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the variable inductor-controlled LED driver are presented.},

Manual collection and annotation of such datasets remain costly and time-consuming, especially when temporal and cross-modal consistency is required. The proposed method introduces Joint Camera-LiDAR Scene Synthesis and Perception (JCLSP), a unified generative framework that simultaneously synthesizes photorealistic RGB images, semantic segmentation maps, and LiDAR range images through a compact and optimized diffusion process. Unlike prior approaches that employ separate diffusion branches, JCLSP fuses image and LiDAR modalities early in the pipeline and leverages a shared latent space for coherent multimodal generation. The architecture integrates three key elements: BKSDM, which streamlines the diffusion process by eliminating redundant blocks, a joint image-LiDAR diffusion module that applies the BKSDM framework to enable depth-aware synthesis with geometric fidelity, and modality-specific decoders that extract semantic masks, LiDAR range images, and image scenes from the shared latent representation. Experimental results on synthetic datasets indicate that JCLSP captures meaningful cross-modal correlations and preserves spatial features. By generating joint representations from camera and LiDAR views along with semantic segmentation annotations, the method demonstrates promising potential for cross-modal representation learning with labeled data.},

Based on these factors, the system optimizes the sub-workspace allocation to minimize the task time deviation and ensure fair workload distribution among heterogeneous robots. The proposed system is evaluated through numerical verification and field evaluation in an agricultural environment. The results of the field evaluation show that the task efficiency is significantly improved, such as a 25.88% reduction in total task time and a 92.89% reduction in task time deviation under optimized conditions. In addition, the similar results of the two evaluations indicate high consistency and performance maintenance of the proposed system performance.

  abstract     = {In a complex and changing agricultural environment, achieving autonomous navigation of agricultural robots and field machinery is a fundamental prerequisite for completing various farming tasks. However, because of the unstructured nature, high dynamics, and signal interference commonly found in agricultural scenarios, achieving high-precision autonomous navigation in such challenging environments remains a significant research challenge. In response to the unique complexity of agricultural settings, this study outlines the evolution of agricultural navigation technologies from single-sensor systems to advanced multi-sensor approaches and systematically evaluates the applicability of commonly used single-sensor methods in complex field environments. The findings indicate that, among single-sensor navigation applications, vision-based techniques are more widely adopted in agricultural scenarios. In contrast, for multi-sensor navigation, integrated systems combining inertial navigation systems and global navigation satellite systems are the most prevalent. Furthermore, in terms of multi-sensor fusion algorithms, kalman filters and their extended variants are extensively employed, demonstrating strong robustness and adaptability. These analyses can offer valuable theoretical foundations and practical guidance for the selection and optimization of fusion strategies in future agricultural navigation systems. This study also compared global and local path planning algorithms. Finally, practical applications of fusion technologies in various agricultural scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Due to resource constraints, Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack built-in security systems, making them vulnerable to zero-day attacks. Consequently, there is a growing need for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for IoT networks. However, traditional anomaly systems suffer from a high number of false positives, which wastes analysts’ time. Besides this, there is a semantic gap between the system outputs and the network operators. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework with large language model (LLM) integration to address those challenges we face in traditional systems. The model not only detects potential threats but also bridges the semantic gap. The framework employs isolation forest for anomaly detection and random forest for device integrity assessment. To enhance anomaly evaluation and improve interpretability, the system’s insights are further processed by GPT-4o mini, an LLM. The LLM elucidates statistical summaries of IoT traffic, assigns risk scores, and provides human-readable explanations and thereby enhancing decision-making. This approach reduces the reliance on expert network operators. As a result, non-technical users can understand and act upon the system’s outputs.},

In response, this paper introduces an innovative approach designed to heighten observability within distribution systems and enhance their resilience against False Data Injection (FDI) cyberattacks. Central to this approach is the introduction of a novel index to quantify the reduction in observability caused by FDI attacks. Distinguishing itself from existing techniques, the proposed approach encompasses three vital components: optimizing monitoring device allocation to minimize costs and enhance observability, FDI detection through existing monitoring devices employing probability density functions (PDF) curves, and the strategic allocation of monitoring devices while considering the impact of an attack on observability. The approach’s validation is performed via tests on a typical distribution system, with varying numbers of monitoring devices and FDI scenarios, consistently delivering significantly improved observability and estimation accuracy. The research findings provide valuable insights into the proactive management of FDI threats, fortifying system integrity, resulting in cost savings, and operational efficiency. Simulation outcomes underscore that optimal allocation of nine monitoring devices in the system under study achieves observability losses and FDI impact index (FDI3) values below 10% and 5%, respectively.},

This study proposes a mathematical model for EV energy consumption and applies Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) with NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) to minimize energy loss while extending driving range through route selection, traffic avoidance, and eco-driving strategies. The framework integrates real-time traffic and weather data from the TomTom Application Programming Interface (API) along with historical traffic records from NYC OpenData. Vehicle-specific data from the Volkswagen eGolf further trains the model under real driving conditions, producing the energy consumption dataset ETotal. Using the ETotal dataset, a predictive algorithm improves energy forecasting accuracy by incorporating traffic flow, road topology, and vehicle dynamics. Numerical simulation results confirm the model’s effectiveness in balancing energy use and travel time through Pareto-optimal decision-making. The AI model generated 100 predictive route options between Times Square and the Holland Tunnel. Among these, route 2 (5.17 km) was identified as the most efficient, requiring only 1.03 kWh of energy ETotal. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI in eco-routing to extend EV range and enhance driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle systems.},

  abstract     = {Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a triple-branch design comprising Patching, Selecting, and Global modules, to encode the input time-series into patch-wise representations, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints of TriP-LLM are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git.},

  abstract     = {Human can drive safely by instinctively accounting for real-time environmental and weather conditions such as snow and rain. In contrast, current autonomous driving systems still face challenges in achieving full autonomy, as their path planning and control rely solely on environmental perception without considering weather conditions. However, to realize fully autonomous driving, it is essential to implement vehicle control technologies that can recognize not only the surrounding environment but also weather conditions, and use this information to adjust steering and longitudinal behaviors—such as acceleration and deceleration—in a human-like manner. To address this issue, this study proposes a perception system capable of recognizing both environmental and weather conditions in real time under snowy weather, enabling weather-aware vehicle control. This is the first perception system to simultaneously provide both object and weather information. It improves detection performance for snow-affected cameras through YOLOv4 and YOLOv8-based training, and enhances LiDAR accuracy by removing snow-induced noise. Robust radar data, resistant to environmental changes, are then fused using a Kalman filter to enable reliable object tracking. Finally, weather information is inferred from the number of real-time filtered LiDAR points, allowing the system to perform simultaneous object tracking and environmental perception in snowy conditions. Compared with existing tracking systems that are not specialized for extreme environments, the proposed system offers more than 50% improved tracking accuracy, accurate snowfall classification with a precision of 0.983, and more than 15% faster processing time. This enables precise path planning and allows for safe vehicle control during steering, acceleration and deceleration by utilizing real-time weather information. This study provides valuable real-time data that enable the seamless operation of all essential components of autonomous driving technology, such as sensors, perception, path planning, and vehicle control, even under snowy conditions, therefore enhancing the potential to achieve Level 5 autonomy.},

OVS-MPC not only reduces the amplitude of CMV but also decreases its dv/dt value. The step CMV value per sampling period has only two types: greater than zero or less than zero, which greatly reduces the dv/dt value. The OVS-MPC achieves a fixed switching frequency, with one phase state remaining unchanged and the other two phases changing only once per sampling period. In addition, the switching sequence is redesigned in the OVS-MPC to reduce the switching losses between adjacent sampling periods. The cost function does not contain any weighting factors, and it can determine the sub-sectors, select the candidate vectors, and calculate the duty ratios. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted on a 5L-ANPC platform. Compared with existing MPC strategies, the OVS-MPC can significantly reduce the RMS value of CMV, and the CMV amplitude will not increase under all modulation indices.},

The initial design leveraged the temperature-dependent properties of Polycaprolactone (PCL) alongside Peltier elements to modulate stiffness and damping. However, this reliance on compressive forces and the inherent stress relaxation of PCL contributed to prolonged response times in the system. The newly developed module addresses these limitations by operating in a ’shear mode’, fundamentally enhancing both heat transfer and response speed, as validated through comprehensive shear rheology analysis of PCL. A standout feature of the revised design is its scalability, which effectively eliminates the necessity for additional mechanical actuators. The compact nature of this thermal actuation solution supports effective miniaturization, making it exceptionally suitable for scenarios where space and weight are at a premium. This development represents a valuable innovation in variable impedance actuators for applications in robotics and biomechanics, where constant adaptation of impedance is less critical, providing a pragmatic solution for environments that demand agile yet compact actuation capabilities.},

This study evaluates the downlink link budget in a dual-steering TN–NTN architecture, where an aerial user simultaneously connects to both a terrestrial network and a LEO satellite network with on-board processing (OBP) for seamless connectivity. The analysis considers Ground-to-Air (G2A) and Satellite-to-Air (S2A) downlink link budgets under realistic 6G conditions, examining the effects of altitude, elevation angle, and frequency. The results demonstrate that minimum link margins of 16.04 dB for G2A and 13.4 dB for S2A are achievable, confirming reliable link performance for both configurations. We thoroughly describe the methodology used to perform the link budget computations. Additionally, we observe that in all cases, the results for the S2A scenario are relatively lower than those for G2A. This is attributed to the longer distance and multi-beam interference from other satellites. For example, at an elevation angle of 80°, the link margin in the S2A scenario is approximately 18 dB, whereas in the G2A case, it is about 45 dB—showing that the S2A link margin is nearly 60% lower.},

The goal of the system is to recognize the semantic boundaries of the images. For this relevant challenges, a novel semantic encoder, based on compressed sensing (CS) is developed at the transmitter to extract semantic information. Additionally, a novel semantic decoder is proposed in the receiver, utilizing sparse reconstruction techniques to reconstruct semantic information. In contrast to prior studies that focused on conveying a broad spectrum of semantic information related to images along with all extracted features, this approach concentrates solely on isolating the semantic features relevant to the specific target edges. This method generates a sparse feature map, allowing for a reduction in compression rates by a novel compressed sensing technique, which implements a new sensing matrix based on polar code (SMPC). The proposed system can perform better across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) without requiring training data or being tied to a specific dataset. Furthermore, the study examines two distinct typical scenarios: noiseless measurements and noisy measurements. Our simulations show that with a lower compression rate, the classification accuracy, and exact recovery probability of 100 % can be attained in both scenarios.},

Experimental results showed that both effects changed the estimations of the principal point, reprojection error and focal length. Zhang estimations presented a more linear tendency of the focal length and a lower reprojection error than Bouguet estimations in diverse underwater conditions. According to the analysis results, it is highly recommended to consider these effects during camera calibration tasks in underwater environments for 3D reconstruction and other vision applications.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified the need for scalable, privacy-preserving, and interpretable intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to detect malicious traffic across distributed IoT networks without centralizing sensitive data. Our IDS model employs a lightweight deep neural network trained collaboratively using FedAvg. SHAP provides global and local attributions; LIME supplies instance-level attributions complementary to SHAP. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoT, CIC-IoT2023, and TII-SSRC-23, demonstrated that our approach achieves 99.3%, 99.5% and 99.0% accuracy in binary classification, respectively and 97.2%, 98.0% and 96.5% accuracy in multi-class scenarios, respectively, closely matching centralized models while preserving data locality and data privacy. Moreover, the integrated XAI methods enhance the model’s transparency by identifying key traffic features contributing to each alert. These results establish FL-XAI as a practical, interpretable, and privacy-respecting IDS for real-world IoT deployments.},

Prior work has found weak or insignificant support that LLM-generated error explanations help students resolve errors faster, especially compared to expert-handwritten error explanations. This work explores how GPT-4o can be influenced through fine-tuning to produce error explanations that resemble expert-handwritten explanations. We evaluate how three error message styles (traditional Python error messages, baseline GPT-4o explanations, fine-tuned GPT-4o explanations) affect novice programmers’ ability to resolve programming errors. Eighty (n = 80) CS1 students completed six debugging tasks using a within-subjects study design that ensured each participant saw each of the three error message styles twice. We measured time-to-fix, number of code reruns, task failure rate, and then asked for students’ preferences. Participants were found to resolve errors significantly faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o messages, but, like prior work, we could not find a statistically significant difference between the baseline GPT-4o and traditional Python error messages. Error message style had no effect on number of reruns and task failures; however, the particular debugging task had a significant difference on both. Despite solving problems faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o model, participants preferred the baseline GPT-4o output (similar to unmodified ChatGPT). These findings strongly suggest that the nature of the debugging task has a greater effect on novice programmers’ error resolution than whether or not the students use a GenAI system to help them debug.},

  abstract     = {In knowledge-enhanced recommendation algorithms, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods have become the dominant paradigm due to their powerful capabilities in modeling higher-order structural information. However, they still face two key challenges: (1) The traditional GNN aggregation mechanism suffers from the over-smoothing phenomenon, which hinders deep networks from effectively capturing fine-grained collaborative signals; (2) The extreme sparsity of user-item interaction data in real-world scenarios limits the availability of supervised signals, which in turn degrades the overall recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-view collaborative fusion and contrastive learning framework (MCFCR) that effectively mines implicit higher-order collaborative signals. Specifically, it performs feature extraction from four types of heterogeneous views, applies cosine similarity to filter semantically similar nodes in each view’s feature space, and introduces a multi-view top-K nearest neighbor fusion mechanism to construct a collaborative neighbor network. Furthermore, during the optimization phase, we design a multi-layer contrastive learning strategy to refine both the commonalities and differences across different views, thereby enhancing multiple self-supervised signals. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods and validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot Video Moment Retrieval (ZVMR) is a task that localizes temporal moments within a video using only natural language queries, without requiring large-scale datasets or extensive training resources. While previous ZVMR studies have focused on aligning high-quality video and query representations, they have faced performance limitations by overlooking the ‘Dual Bias’ problem, which arises from the excessive specificity of queries and the generality of video captions. To address this challenge, we propose the DBCON (Dual Bias CONtrol) framework, which simultaneously controls caption specificity and query generalization. DBCON employs ‘Query-Aware Caption Refinement’ to induce captions that explicitly reflect the core information of the query, and ‘Query Debiasing’ to rephrase the user query into a more universal expression via an LLM. Our experiments show that DBCON effectively mitigates this dual bias, achieving up to 1.73% higher retrieval accuracy on mAP@avg compared to the state-of-the-art model on the QVHighlights test benchmark. This study is significant as it presents a new direction for developing scalable and efficient video-language retrieval systems.},

When drivers plug in their EV into a CP, the EV authenticates itself to the CP with a so-called contract certificate. Then, the CP automatically initiates charging and billing. In this paper, we identify gaps in PnC regarding the installation process of the contract certificate in EVs.We propose an alternative approach based on modern extensions of OAuth 2, i.e., OpenID Federation with a Device Authorization Grant and a Rich Authorization Request. We perform a symbolic protocol verification using the Tamarin prover to prove security, provide an open-source implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, and evaluate the performance of the prototype. The new approach is more user-friendly, more secure, and features a less complex EV charging authorization than existing solutions.

  abstract     = {With the rapid expansion of the Internet and the increasing reliance on digital services, cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated. This rise in malicious activities necessitates the development of stronger security measures, particularly across the physical, network, and application layers of the 5G architecture. Given the complexity and scale of modern networks, ensuring robust security mechanisms to mitigate cyber threats is crucial to maintaining service reliability and user trust. This paper proposes a DDoS detection framework capable of self-automating the detection and mitigation of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks as well as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in next wireless generations. The framework utilizes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to increase precision and optimize resource use regarding the detection of attacks on the 5G network’s application and transport layers. To test the efficacy of the suggested framework, a series of tests was conducted using diverse ML and DL models. The findings illustrate advanced cyber threat detection capabilities among some deep learning architectures. In binary classification of an attack, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) indeed achieved the undisputable highest recall rate of 99.98%, confirming the systems’ effectiveness in discerning between normal and attack traffic. Also, while being involved in multi-attack classification, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model surpassed other models in recall, reporting an impressive 99.04% rate. It can be observed that the suggested deep learning architectures have high effectiveness for enhancing 5G networks security related to ongoing DoS and DDoS threats. The findings revealed by the proposed framework do unlock a new perspective on enhancing network resilience against sophisticated cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for secure, immersive authentication in extended reality (XR) environments calls for neural interfaces that are both robust and user-friendly. This study introduces a novel and robust dual-modality EEG-based authentication framework that independently exploits (i) Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) and (ii) voluntary eye-blink–induced EEG responses as covert neural signatures. Both signals are recorded using a 64-channel EEG system seamlessly integrated with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for immersive XR-based user evaluation. To mitigate visual fatigue while preserving signal fidelity, we replace conventional flicker stimuli with a 10 Hz grow–shrink visual design. We employ a modality-specific classification strategy, modeling SSVEP and eye-blink signals independently to retain their distinct neurophysiological characteristics. A multi-stage feature selection pipeline combines SHAP and Random Forest rankings, followed by logistic regression–based permutation importance to identify the top 10 discriminative features per modality. These features undergo statistical validation via non-parametric tests to ensure physiological plausibility and class separability. Classification is subsequently performed using four machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression—with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently yielding the highest performance. Evaluated across 20 participants using user-wise validation, our framework achieves over 99% accuracy and near-perfect ROC-AUC scores for both modalities, confirming strong discriminability between genuine and impostor attempts. Our results demonstrate that interpretable, fatigue-aware EEG features can deliver high authentication performance under real-time XR conditions. The proposed system is lightweight, spoof-resistant, and well-suited for deployment in XR-based defense, training, and industrial applications.},

The current nonhybrid QoE prediction models tend to suffer from poor accuracy due to the inability to model complex and varied temporal/spatial dependencies. We suggest using a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pick up on visual details and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to understand time-based patterns. This combined method works well for estimating QoE by considering both the visual details and the timing of video data, even when network conditions change. To do this research, we applied this set of metrics to the Waterloo QoE IV database, a robust benchmark for QoE prediction. We train and evaluate the proposed model under various streaming conditions, taking into account network fluctuations, adaptive bitrate streaming strategy, and user behavior. To improve the predictive performance of our framework, feature selection methods are incorporated to remove redundancy, reduce computational complexity, and retain high accuracy. The experimental results showed that the CNN-LSTM model is much better than the current QoE prediction methods, achieving a linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.8929 and a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) of 0.8846. We also dramatically reduced prediction errors (RMSE) to 7.7323 subjective QoE scores. This evidence suggests the efficacy of our approach to grab both the spatial and the temporal dependencies, which makes the QoE prediction more robust. Therefore, this work helps develop intelligent streaming adaptation mechanisms to enhance and smooth video streaming services for end users.},

Compared to physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), or galvanic skin response (GSR), eye tracking offers a less intrusive method for the classification of cognitive load. However, previous studies that used traditional machine learning have faced limitations in the accuracy of multiclass classification and relied on proprietary feature extraction methods. Hence, it hinders reproducibility with noncommercial software. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach by implementing three time series deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)—to enhance cognitive load classification in multiclass scenarios. By introducing various temporal windows for novel features and optimizing hyperparameters during training, we improved the accuracy of the cognitive load classification. We benchmarked these deep learning models against traditional machine learning techniques on the COLET dataset. The experimental results revealed that deep learning models significantly outperformed conventional machine learning methods, with BiLSTM achieving the highest accuracies of 0.8780 and 0.8836 for the classification of cognitive load and activity tasks in multiclass scenarios, respectively. This study highlights the potential of deep learning to revolutionize cognitive workload assessments. Using eye movement indices, our method facilitates accurate, scalable, and cost-effective solutions suitable for low-cost eye tracking devices, broadening accessibility for applications in education, healthcare, and beyond.},

We present LLMYOLOEdge, a fully on-device framework that integrates YOLO object detection (YOLOv8/11/12 variants) with quantized instruction-tuned LLMs—Qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct for reliable image-reference extraction and Granite3-MoE:1b-instruct for concise textual summarization—served locally via Ollama and orchestrated by a lightweight Flask API on Raspberry Pi 4B as a resource constrained egde-Internet of Things (IoT) setup. The system employs grammar-constrained, multi-shot prompting to guarantee structured JSON outputs and instruments every stage with fine-grained metrics for rigorous statistical analysis. On a Raspberry Pi 4B, LLMYOLOEdge sustains real-time operation while preserving data locality. Across extensive trials, we observe significant performance differences among YOLO backbones – yolo11n.pt yields the shortest inference latency (1013.241 ms), whereas yolo12s.pt minimizes extractor prompt-evaluation time (19.242 × 109 ns). The multi-shot extractor achieves perfect URL/path extraction accuracy (100%), outperforming a baseline Granite3-MoE approach (88.89%). One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD and pairwise t-tests confirm these effects at p < 0.001, establishing both efficiency and accuracy gains under strict resource budgets. Our contributions are threefold such as (i) an integrated, privacy-preserving multimodal pipeline that runs entirely on commodity edge hardware; (ii) a principled prompting strategy that removes brittle parsing failure modes; and (iii) a reproducible evaluation suite reporting per-stage latencies, throughput, and correctness.

In the GitHub system, a labeling mechanism has been introduced for systematic issue management, but significant effort from developers is required to label and manage these issues. To address this, numerous attempts have been made in previous research to automate issue report classification. However, these attempts have shown limitations in classification accuracy. We experiment to determine if integrating heterogeneous information through a multimodal model that combines text, images, and code from issue reports can improve classification accuracy. Specifically, we investigate whether training the model on extensive issue data can enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the multimodal approach outperforms single-modal models by 5.50-7.01% in terms of F1-Score, demonstrating superior performance. These findings indicate that leveraging heterogeneous data sources in issue reports is effective in improving classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Delivering mechanical vibratory stimuli to the upper body in synchronization with audiovisual content can enhance emotional experiences. Previous studies on emotion amplification have primarily focused on videos with predetermined emotional content and timing. This study extends the application to interactive content, where the emotional narrative dynamically changes based on user interaction. We propose a novel approach that provides real-time vibratory feedback to the thoracoabdominal region in response to increases in a user’s skin conductance response (SCR), thereby amplifying emotional arousal. A total of 27 participants were involved in the study, engaging in two distinct types of games: an action game and a suspense-puzzle game. Using a within-participants design, we compared conditions with and without vibratory feedback during gameplay. The results showed a significant increase in self-reported emotional arousal with vibratory feedback. In the action game, subjective frustration and excitement were significantly enhanced, while in the puzzle game, tension was amplified. Additionally, in the action game, the number of peaks and variability of SCR signals increased significantly under the vibratory feedback condition. These findings establish a foundation for technologies aimed at augmenting human emotional experiences during interactive content engagement.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an energy-field-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method (HES-COMA) for evaluating individual agent contributions and learning efficient policies in dynamic and complex multi-agent environments such as sports games. The proposed method addresses the limitations of the conventional single-layer approach by using energy fields in a global layer to learn strategic positioning, and in a local layer to determine tactical actions (e.g., shooting, stealing, and blocking) from those positions. Specifically, the method assigns an energy value to represent the relative importance of key elements in the game space (ball, opponents, teammates, basket, and shooting probability spots), and builds a dynamically changing energy field depending on the state of play (offense, defense, free scenario, etc.). Experimental results in a commercialized 3vs3 basketball game environment show that HES-COMA achieves approximately 1.5 times faster learning speed than Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA). It also improved the success rates of steals, rebounds, and blocks by factors of 1.38, 1.87, and 2.71, respectively. Moreover, by combining global strategic positioning information with local tactical decision-making, HES-COMA’s movement patterns more closely resemble those of users and FSM-based agents in terms of spatial utilization. Consequently, HES-COMA effectively addresses contribution evaluation and data diversity issue in dynamic multi-agent sports games, thereby boosting both learning efficiency and overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In computational pathology, one of the most investigated aspects concerns the analysis of patients’ tissue images. This type of image is often called a Whole Slide Image (WSI) and is characterised by a high resolution that makes impractical, if not impossible, the classical analysis methods that process the image in a single step. Automatic and Deep Learning methods fit into this context in an attempt to provide automatic medical decision support. In this paper, we present two networks capable, thanks to deep metric learning, of classifying tissue images using a low-dimensional embedding space. This projection makes it easy to visualise the elements of the training set, showing that the different classes are almost always well separated. The embedding is calculated by minimizing the distance between elements of the same class and maximising the distance between elements of different classes. Consequently, the proposed system offers an effective way to visualize the learned classification mechanism. Using four different datasets, we show how this system achieves results in line with and sometimes better than state-of-the-art methods, despite being a much simpler model. A further strength lies in the possibility of having a visualisation that makes the classification mechanism explicit. In addition, we provide a classification confidence score that can add useful information to the medical decision support system.},

  abstract     = {The stock market plays a pivotal role in global economy. Accurate stock market prediction not only assists governments in formulating macroeconomic policies but also helps investors to make informed decisions, thereby contributing to economic and market stability. However, the inherent high volatility, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of stock data pose significant challenges to accurate forecasting. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid model, named Attention-guided Improved Decomposition-Reconstruction Model (AIDRM), for accurate stock market prediction. First, the model decomposes the raw stock indices using Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) to capture their inherent complexity. The decomposed sub-series are then concatenated and adaptively weighted through an attention mechanism, guiding the model focus on key features that affect forecasting accuracy. The concatenation of sub-series prior to prediction can mitigate the typical error accumulation problem of the traditional decomposition-reconstruction frameworks. Finally, the attention-refined features are fed into the Informer model to generate predictions. Experiments on four major indices (SSEC, SZI, STI, and S&P 500) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning benchmarks, achieving RMSE reductions of 17.6 – 32.5% across all tested stock indices. In addition, the ablation study verified the effectiveness of each module.},

  abstract     = {In modern maritime operations, electric ship power systems (SPSs) play a crucial role as they integrate distributed energy resources to meet stringent environmental targets while ensuring reliability in dynamic and isolated marine environments. Energy management systems (EMS) are critical to optimizing fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and maintaining power quality under variable load demands and the harsh conditions in which ships operate. This paper presents a comprehensive review of EMS methodologies for SPS, covering traditional methods such as evolutionary algorithms, model predictive control (MPC), fuzzy logic control, and more modern approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML and DL for EMS offer predictive and adaptive capabilities for real-time optimization, but face limitations in data security and centralized computational demands. Federated learning (FL), which is a decentralized, privacy-preserving paradigm, is a viable solution to the disadvantages of the conventional centralized form of training in ML. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed systems without raw data sharing, addressing critical concerns in cybersecurity and communication overhead. However, FL does require individual devices or clients to have enough computational power to carry out distributed optimization locally. A detailed overview of FL, including the FL training process, categories, architectures and various applications of FL in ship and energy systems, is presented in this paper. To further establish the usefulness of conducting energy management (EM) in ship systems, the paper presents a case study on a notional four-zone DC SPS in which FL has been utilized to collaboratively train DL models across multiple generators without sharing sensitive local data. The results demonstrate better generator output power prediction and effective load management in comparison to the conventional centralized learning setup, indicating the potential of FL to enhance energy efficiency and reliability in ship systems. Finally, some challenges and possible research gaps in applying FL to ship systems are discussed.},

To address this isFsue, we propose a detection method based on Open Set Recognition and a dual-branch switching mechanism for periodic full retraining, called Twin-Interaction Network. By adding a shallow model on top of the Vision Transformer network for target feature extraction, this approach performs spatial transformations on feature vectors to enhance the accuracy of unknown target detection. Furthermore, to endow the model with the capability of periodic full retraining, two open-set recognition modules are integrated into a twin architecture, simultaneously performing classification and learning tasks without interference. The open-set recognition method is incorporated into the offline full-model retraining framework for validation. Through an alternating learning mechanism, the Twin-Interaction Network can acquire more precise feature tensors of unknown category, thereby making the classification accuracy of the model for unknown categories consistent with that for known categories. The generalization performance of the proposed method is evaluated using multiple public datasets under standard dataset settings, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of open-set recognition accuracy.},

Selecting a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) channel with less path loss and high gain is challenging to achieve high-speed UOC. To handle this problem, an Impulsive Gain focused Channel Selection Method (IG-CS) is introduced. This method focuses on the scattering rate and the gain drop due to long-distance UOC through single-channel estimation. In this estimation process, channel availability and intermediate interruptions in channel selection are accounted for to ensure a low path loss communication. The selection is verified through a linear distribution function polynomial, where the gain and loss are inversely proportional in the increasing order of the gain. The switchover between the channels is made based on any deviation between the impulsive gain and channel utilization. In this case, the availability is updated based on the rate of gain observed in the previous intervals. This proposed method is optimal in reducing path loss and improving the channel selection rate. The proposed IG-CS improves the average channel capacity by 12.09%, reduces the path loss by 10.69%, and improves the channel gain by 12.44% for the highest SNR considered.},

This study proposes an innovative solution to this problem by designing a multi-layered, adaptive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) comprising interacting large language model (LLM) agents. The proposed system performs semantic-level information retrieval using a BioBERT-based vector database, enhances information retrieval by accessing up-to-date medical resources via the web, and restructures outputs by activating an adaptive optimization loop in low-confidence situations. Through the structuring of clinical texts, cross-validation of symptom analyses with literature and internet sources, and collaborative data fusion among agents, the system integrates multi-source data and produces consistent decisions. In experiments conducted on the MedQA, PubMedQA, and MedBullets datasets, the system achieved accuracies of 94%, 88%, and 84%, respectively, representing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the significance of the proposed architecture for clinical decision-making reliability. This framework is not merely an information retrieval engine; it is a clinical intelligence partner designed to learn, actively contribute to the decision process, and focus on reliability. In contrast to current CDSS protocols, which frequently depend on static modules or single-agent models, our architecture tackles some of the shortcomings in timeliness, multi-source evidence fusion, and confidence calibration. This originality enables the system to be a next-generation clinical intelligence partner by enabling an unprecedented level of transparency, customizability, and adaptability in real-world decision-making processes.},

However, the key nonlinear factors within these systems significantly affect their control characteristics throughout the operating cycle. Traditional bond graph analysis focuses on the system’s dynamic response, but lacks efficient and systematic methods to evaluate how parameter variations influence performance. Although sensitivity analysis can assess these influences, it relies heavily on state-space equations, which involve complex modeling, offer limited physical intuition, and are prone to derivation errors that are difficult to verify. Therefore, this study focuses on an area-pressure difference composite flow control system and proposes a novel integration of power bond graph-based state-space modeling with first-order trajectory sensitivity analysis. A comprehensive sensitivity equation system with 21 parameters was established, and a dual-sensitivity evaluation metric was introduced for quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis confirmed that the flow force dominated the fluctuations in the main valve pressure difference, with negligible effects from the spring force. The hydraulic resistance of the non-spring chamber orifice, spool equivalent mass, and throttle equivalent flow area significantly affected the compensator spool momentum. Further research indicates that increasing the hydraulic resistance of the damping orifice effectively suppresses spool momentum fluctuations, although hysteresis effects must be considered. Experimentally, flow-force compensation reduced the flow error by 4%, validating its role as the primary cause of the pressure difference variations. This research holds significant engineering application value for optimizing control strategies and improving dynamic response performance to enhance the flow control accuracy of the system.},

Measuring this concentration using remote sensing and automated artificial intelligence allows continuous monitoring at relatively low cost. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and scalable deep learning model to accurately estimate sea ice concentration from satellite imagery, supporting climate monitoring efforts. Hence, Ice-SPP-net (ISPP-net) is introduced as an innovative approach to measuring sea ice concentration using Sentinel-2 imagery, leveraging a novel multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This model is specifically designed to address challenges posed by the complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, which conventional fixed-scale CNNs struggle to assess accurately. By incorporating Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) modules, the ISPP-net effectively captures and integrates features across multiple scales, enhancing the model’s ability to discern both fine details and broader contextual information essential for precise measurements. The model was trained and evaluated using annotated Sentinel-2 datasets and validated through a comprehensive ablation study to determine the optimal architecture configuration. Results show that placing the SPP module at the third encoder layer, using three parallel paths, yields the best performance. This configuration outperforms models like U-Net, SegNet, DABNet, TernausNet, and FC-DenseNet, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 49.20% and an accuracy of 89.30%. ISPP-net provides critical data to refine climate models and improve predictions of future climate scenarios. Future enhancements will integrate more data sources and refine the architecture, supporting SDG 13: Climate Action.},

  abstract     = {The translation of classical Sanskrit texts presents unique challenges due to the language's complex morpho-phonological structure, rich grammatical system, and cultural-philosophical depth. This paper introduces the Sanskrit Linguistic Intelligence Pipeline (SLIP), a comprehensive framework that integrates traditional Sanskrit grammatical analysis with modern neural machine translation architectures to enhance translation quality for classical texts. SLIP incorporates morphological feature extraction (verb tenses, case endings, prefixes), phonological analysis (vowel ratios, syllable patterns, sandhi rules), and structural processing (compound word detection, sentence analysis) specifically designed for Sanskrit linguistic characteristics. The paper evaluates SLIP across multiple neural architectures including enhanced transformers, MBART, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using diverse evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore) on Bhagavad Gita verses spanning different thematic categories. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: SLIP-enhanced transformers achieve a 10.20% relative improvement in BERT F1-score (57.63% to 63.51%) with statistical significance, while RAG integration yields remarkable gains of up to 41.8% in BLEU-4 scores. Comparative analysis reveals that domain-specific linguistic intelligence significantly outperforms generic large language models, with enhanced transformers showing +5.88 BERT F1 improvement compared to MBART's -7.12 decline. Thematic analysis indicates variable effectiveness across philosophical concepts, with austerity practices showing the highest improvement (+7.23%) compared to food classifications (+4.73%). These findings demonstrate that Sanskrit-specific morpho-phonological feature engineering provides superior translation quality compared to generic multilingual approaches, offering a paradigm for preserving semantic accuracy and cultural nuances in automated translation of ancient languages. The SLIP framework addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and provides a foundation for broader digitization efforts of classical Indian literature.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of USV technology, autonomous maritime systems are increasingly employed in marine monitoring, resource exploration, and environmental protection. However, collision avoidance remains a critical challenge, exceptionally in complex and dynamic multi-vessel maritime scenarios that demand legal compliance and real-time responsiveness. This paper proposes an International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)-compliant intelligent collision avoidance decision-making algorithm for multi-USV systems. The framework integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), game-theoretic reasoning, distributed coordination, and multi-sensor fusion. A Collision Risk Indicator (CRI) is introduced, based on Distance at Closest Point of Approach (DCPA) and Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA), enhanced by differences in relative position, velocity, and heading, to support real-time risk assessment. To ensure regulatory adherence, the system classifies vessel encounter types (head-on, crossing, overtaking) and determines corresponding COLREGs roles (give-way or stand-on) using game-theoretic logic. These symbolic roles and encounter types are embedded into the DRL state vector as discrete semantic features. This semantic embedding enables the learning agent to generate behavior strategies that are both adaptive and COLREGs-compliant. A dynamic path planning and heading adjustment strategy is proposed, continuously modifying course and speed in response to evolving collision risk and regulatory constraints. A distributed multi-agent decision-making mechanism allows USVs to cooperate through local information exchange and decentralized negotiation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior collision avoidance performance, faster response times, and improved compliance with COLREGs in complex maritime scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) have recently emerged as promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Due to their unique ability to selectively target cancer cells without directly affecting healthy cells, they have been extensively studied. Meanwhile, many small molecule drugs are being introduced and evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for anticancer treatments. However, experimental identification and characterization of anticancer small molecules (ACSMs) remains laborious and time-consuming. In this study, we propose an innovative computational approach, termed ACSMPred-FRL, that can accurately and rapidly identify compounds with or without anticancer activity based on a feature representation learning scheme. In ACSMPred-FRL, we initially constructed 442 base-classifiers by employing 13 machine learning (ML) algorithms in conjunction with 14 molecular descriptors and 20 molecular embeddings. Next, probabilistic features based on these 442 base-classifiers were generated and combined to provide multi-view information embedded in ACSMs. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to process the 442 probabilistic features resulting in 42 principal components used as input vectors for developing the final meta-classifier. Finally, the optimal feature subset was determined and used to train the final meta-classifier. Both cross-validation and independent tests showed that ACSMPred-FRL not only surpassed several conventional ML-based classifiers but also outperformed the existing method, highlighting its effectiveness and predictive capability. Specifically, on the independent test dataset, ACSMPred-FRL achieved an accuracy of 0.834, a specificity of 0.88, and a Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.672, representing improvements of 4.45, 4.70, and 9.20%, respectively, over the existing method. Therefore, we anticipate that ACSMPred-FRL will serve as a useful and reliable tool for the large-scale identification of ACSMs, accelerating their application in cancer treatment.

  abstract     = {Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for displaying low-quality broadcast content on high-resolution screens. Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify key factors influencing perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images. The proposed dataset and the subjective evaluation platform are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/ivml/datasets/sreb.},

We present Efficient Spectral Inception Former Change Detector (ESIFCD), an efficient dual-temporal network that couples domain-aligned differencing with multiple cross-resolution exchange and lightweight global context encoding. ESIFCD introduces: (i) an Adaptive Difference Fusion Unit (ADFU) that fuses absolute and learned differences over spatial, spectral, and texture features; (ii) a Cross-Resolution Aggregation Module (CRAM) that repeatedly exchanges evidence among four scales to mitigate scale disagreement; (iii) a Patch-Aware Context Encoder (PACE) that models long-range dependencies via tokenized patches with modest cost; and (iv) a fast GLCM-Stats Encoder that supplies texture semantics (ASM/Contrast/Correlation) without analytical histograms. A re-parameterized large-kernel block (RLKB) sharpens local detail, and a late MetaCNNGate learns pixel-wise weights over one primary and four auxiliary heads to consolidate their complementary expertise (small vs. large structures). Across six public benchmarks, ESIFCD attains the best F1 on each dataset: 93.19% (LEVIR-CD), 87.89% (LEVIR-CD+), 70.10% (S2Looking), 95.95% (CDD), 83.48% (SYSU-CD), and 95.30% (WHU-CD). The model is efficient and fast (12.33 GFLOPs; 82.07 images/s at 2562), and with automatic mixed precision reaches over 165 images/s while maintaining accuracy, surpassing recent strong baselines under the same setting. Ablations confirm that ADFU improves robustness to radiometric and registration noise, CRAM preserves thin structures and prevents fragmentation on large objects, PACE improves cluttered scenes, and MetaCNNGate consistently lifts F1 on all benchmarks.},

Despite significant advancements, the development of robust Turkish OCR systems faces several obstacles, such as a lack of publicly available datasets, limited open-source solutions, and the underutilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques. These challenges hinder the creation of OCR systems that can match the capabilities of those developed for languages like English. Focusing on 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2019 and 2023, this paper provides the first systematic review of Turkish OCR research, offering a comprehensive analysis of the current methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics across both modern Turkish (Latin script) and Ottoman Turkish (Arabic script) contexts. Our findings highlight that while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) architectures are frequently used, Transformer-based and end-to-end models remain underexplored in Turkish OCR. We also identify data scarcity and the lack of reproducible benchmark datasets as key barriers. By analyzing current research trends, pinpointing challenges, and emphasizing opportunities for future advancements, this review aims to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in Turkish language text recognition. Our study contributes to the field by offering a structured overview of existing methods and proposes practical recommendations for improving dataset availability, encouraging open-source collaboration, and adopting more advanced model architectures.},

Leveraging the ShanghaiTech dataset for crowd density estimation and the UCSD Pedestrian Database for anomaly detection, the framework integrates a Robust Maximum Correntropy Kalman Filter (RMCKF) for effective image pre-processing, followed by a Self-Modulating Convolutional Neural Network (SMCNN) that accurately classifies crowd density levels into sparse, medium, and dense categories. Subsequently, a Pixel-Associated Auto Encoder (PAAE) is employed to detect and localize anomalies such as cycling, skateboarding, and unauthorized vehicles in pedestrian environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IADL-CDE model achieves significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient compared to the baseline methods.

Feature attribution techniques, including Expected Gradients and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), are employed to identify the most influential input features on the outputs, both individually and collectively. Interpretability is essential for building trust for system operators and plays a key role in debugging, validation, and fine-tuning.

  abstract     = {Normal mixture models are widely used to represent data arising from latent subpopulations. We propose a Design-of-Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) framework to estimate the weights of a bimodal Gaussian mixture when component families are known. The procedure is non-iterative: rather than alternating Expectation Maximization (EM) steps, it performs a double-stage method - fit a quadratic response surface to the sample log-likelihood over the weight simplex and solve one constrained optimization - followed by a final Maximum Likelihood re-estimation of means and variances. This yields predictable runtime (driven by design size) and reduced sensitivity to initialization. The pipeline uses (i) k-medians to obtain preliminary component parameters and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for component proportions; (ii) builds a simplex-lattice mixture design within those CI bounds; (iii) fits a quadratic response surface to log-likelihood; and (iv) optimizes this surface under sum-to-one constraints. We validate the method in 27 Monte Carlo scenarios (n = 100, 500, 1000; low/medium/high differentiation and three weight settings). In medium/high separation, it attains comparable likelihoods to EM while achieving more favorable BIC in multiple scenarios and indistinguishable AIC in many, whereas EM is preferable under low separation. Two real data sets - Old Faithful (Waiting variable) and Photovoltaic Energy (Production variable) - further confirm applicability, with lower AIC/BIC in Old Faithful and lower BIC in PV; clustering agreement is high (κ ≈ 0.99 - 1.00). Overall, DOE-RSM offers a simple, interpretable, and often more parsimonious method, and constitutes a non-iterative alternative for mixture-weight estimation.},

To address this, we proposed a novel framework that integrates an attention-based feature enhancement module within a knowledge distillation-based incremental learning pipeline. The AFEM combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to strengthen feature representations by enhancing spatial localization and classification across tasks. Our approach employs a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher model preserves prior knowledge while the student model learns new classes through multi-level distillation losses applied to features, region proposals, and final predictions. Experiments conducted on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method achieves 60.802% AP for the base class. It maintains 56.969% AP after one incremental phase, with a forgetting rate of just 3.833% using Huber loss and achieving improved detection accuracy with MSE loss.

We derive the basic reproduction number R0 and perform stability analysis to determine conditions for outbreak control (R0 < 1) versus persistence (R0 > 1). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the proportion of infected systems becoming new malware sources (parameter m) most strongly influences outbreak potential. We extend the model to incorporate quantum computing effects, introducing quantum-enhanced malware and quantum-resistant defenses. Optimal control strategies are developed using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle to minimize system damage while balancing intervention costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum threats can increase the reproduction number by 281%, while quantum defenses can reduce this amplification by 29%.

The study was conducted on a group of over sixty participants using eye-tracking technology and System Usability Scale (SUS) surveys. Several metrics were applied based on features related to eye tracking and task completion. Raw data, including fixations and saccades, was used to generate scan paths and heat maps, enabling objective measurement of respondents’ aggregated attention intensity and gaze patterns. Results. The results revealed particular usability issues that significantly confuse users or make the system difficult to use. Although Linux and macOS differ significantly in interface design and functionality, these objective distinctions were not reflected in users’ mean subjective assessments. Median score analysis suggests that Windows and Linux were rated similarly, while macOS consistently ranked lower. Conversely, in objective performance measures, Linux demonstrated the poorest outcomes, whereas Windows performed best in perceived usability. The results suggest that users rely on familiar interaction patterns and spatial memory, which may explain inconsistencies linked to prior experience with Windows. In detailed primary OS-specific analysis, Linux and macOS demonstrate relatively stable outcomes, whereas Windows shows greater variability.},

  abstract     = {We propose to detect and interpret multimodal metaphors based on affective embeddings and deep transformer representations across diverse linguistic and visual contexts. Designed for large-scale figurative language analysis, our system uncovers coherent, metaphorically rich expressions through hierarchical multimodal learning. This pipeline extracts diverse semantic featuresąłsuch as emotional valence and conceptual mappingsąłenhanced via weakly supervised learning to ensure broad coverage of metaphorical phenomena. An affective-embedding-based feature selection strategy filters out less discriminative attributes, producing refined multimodal representations. These representations are projected into a transformer, where each expression is modeled as a spatial sequence of the abstract conceptual blends, supporting precise metaphor identification. We construct a weighted similarity graph from these multimodal embeddings, enabling large-scale metaphor clustering through advanced graph-based detection. The resulting metaphor communities reflect shared conceptual mappings-such as anger-as-heat or life-as-journey patternsąłand reveal both conventional and novel metaphorical associations. To deliver accurate metaphor interpretation, a ranking module integrates individual expression features with community-level conceptual patterns to suggest relevant metaphorical meanings. Evaluations on the Multimodal Metaphor Dataset (MMD-1.3M), comprising 1.3 million instances spanning 50 conceptual categories, show that our model achieves an BER score of 0.487 on metaphor identification, outperforming strong baselines like ViLBERT and CLIP by more than 6 points. The system also demonstrates 0.792 clustering precision on novel metaphorical associations, confirming its scalability and accuracy across varied metaphor types and its effectiveness in large-scale figurative language processing.},

  abstract     = {A study is presented that gives an overview of the state of the art in hands-on robotics education. It is based on an international survey among instructors on their use of different forms of equipment, i.e., robot hardware, simulation, and data-sets, in combination with different access forms, i.e., in-presence, online, and take-home, across different teaching activities with practical components, i.e., labs, projects, and the supervision of BSc/MSc theses. Furthermore, it is checked whether the COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out 5 years before survey, had lasting effects. It turns out that simulation is the most popular form of regularly used equipment, i.e., almost all instructors report to use simulation in robotics hands-on activities. It is followed by robot hardware where it is noteworthy that in labs about a quarter, i.e., 24% of the instructors do not regularly use it. Data-sets are particular popular as a occasionally used element. With respect to access forms, in-presence dominates for hardware. For simulation and data-sets, in-presence, online, and take-home are all popular and often used in combination. Among the alternatives to in-presence use of hardware, take-home robotics hardware is clearly more popular than online, i.e., remote access to robots. While the effect is less pronounced for participants with more than 10 years of teaching experience, there is a clear sentiment that the COVID-19 pandemic has had lasting effects on hands-on teaching in robotics. Instructors experimented with new forms of hands-on teaching during the pandemic, and they kept (some of) the changes afterward.},

The increasing complexity of phishing techniques necessitates the development of robust and intelligent detection frameworks. This paper introduces PhishOFE, a novel machine learning-based framework for phishing URL detection that utilizes Optimized Feature Engineering. The proposed framework extracts URL and HTML-based features and derives composite features to enhance phishing detection accuracy while minimizing dependence on thirdparty data. The PhishOFE dataset is constructed using diverse phishing and legitimate URLs sourced from various repositories, which ensures comprehensive feature representation. Experiments were conducted using ten different machine learning models, and the results show that CatBoost achieves the highest detection accuracy of 99.48%, with superior precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework reduces computational complexity by utilizing an existing machine learning model, making it suitable for real-time applications and its potential for integration into cybersecurity solutions to counter evolving phishing tactics.},

  abstract     = {Abnormal contact temperature of high-voltage switchgear poses a threat to the safety of the power system, and traditional detection methods have limitations in accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a dual-stream residual-YOLOv10 hierarchical warning method by integrating infrared thermal imaging and visible light image data. The method uses cross-attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal alignment and improves the C2f structure of YOLOv10, combining spatial refinement units and channel refinement units to enhance small target localization accuracy. A hybrid local channel attention module is introduced to improve feature capture. The method combines absolute temperature values and rate of change for comprehensive scoring to achieve hierarchical warnings, and optimizes the model through online learning and knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that in performance tests, the final training accuracy of the model approaches 98%, with loss values stabilizing around 0.3. Compared with other algorithms, the model performs well across various abnormal category recognition. Application analysis indicates that after applying this model, the average response time for abnormal detection has been reduced from over 15 minutes to 4-8 minutes, and the false alarm rate has decreased from 7%-8% to 2%-3%. In different scenarios, the contact detection accuracy exceeds 95%, and the false alarm rate is controlled at 1.23%-2.15%, with the three-level warning response time being less than 19ms. In summary, this method effectively addresses the challenge of hierarchical warning for abnormal contact temperatures in switchgear, offering high reliability and strong practicality, performing excellently across multiple scenarios, and demonstrating promising application prospects.},

To accurately detect violence, it is essential to consider human interactions and minimize noise in surveillance footage. This study explores violence detection using a dual-stream deep neural network with human skeletons and motion changes as inputs extracted from surveillance videos. Furthermore, a weighted fusion strategy is employed, which integrates fusion operation functions, activation functions, and weighted outputs to prioritize the most relevant features from multiple inputs for effective violence detection. Our proposed framework is both effective and accurate, achieving accuracy of 95.05%.

The trigonometric function-based sine cosine algorithm (SCA) may solve such problems, but it traps in local optima, making it inappropriate for larger optimization tasks. This paper introduces a novel multi-trial vector-based sine cosine algorithm (MTV-SCA) for the identification of seven unknown parameters of PEMFCs. The proposed MTV-SCA incorporates MTV methodology utilizing three control parameters to achieve the desired optimization targets. A key contribution of this work is the development of four distinct search strategies, to mitigating early convergence issues. These strategies leverage various sinusoidal and cosinusoidal factors to improve the algorithm. The optimization goal is to minimize sum square error (SSE) between measured and simulated stack voltages. Five PEMFC stack mode:250W, BCS 500W, SR-12, H-12, and Temasek 1 kW, validate the MTV-SCA algorithm’s efficacy and robustness Compared to previously established optimization approaches, MTV-SCA extracts optimum PEMFC parameters more accurately and reliably. Statistical testing further demonstrates the method’s durability and consistency. Analyzing PEMFC performance at different pressures and temperatures helps verify the adjusted parameters. Simulations show that the MTV-SCA solves difficult PEMFC parameter identification issues better than SCA and other approaches.},

Previous deep learning approaches have achieved promising results using MRI data; however, most rely on full 3D volumes or standard 2D axial and coronal slices, often overlooking the diagnostic value of parasagittal views. In addition, many existing models lack attention mechanisms and multi-branch architectures, limiting their ability to capture both localized and contextual features. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-guided dual-path CNN that integrates sagittal, coronal, and parasagittal slices extracted at a 6.257° off-midline angle. The architecture combines a focused SNeurodCNN branch with an Inception-v4 path enhanced by CBAM for multi-scale feature extraction. Using T1-weighted MRI scans from the ADNI database, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.9% and an AUC of 0.992, highlighting its potential for accurate and early AD classification.},

Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) theoretical framework, this study investigates how the linguistic structure of prompts affects users’ willingness to use AI-based video generation tools by shaping their perception of camera movement. The research adopts two types of prompt structures—terminology-driven and context-guided—as independent variables. Using image-to-video generation as experimental stimuli, the study employs a within-subjects experimental design and structural equation modeling (SEM) for empirical analysis. The results indicate that five perceptual dimensions—visual coherence, sense of immersion, realism and naturalness, output professionalism, and trust—significantly and positively predict users’ behavioral intention to use the tools. However, the difference in user ratings across perceptual dimensions between the two prompt types did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that prompt language structures have not yet exerted a measurable impact on subjective user perception. Furthermore, mediation analysis did not reveal significant indirect effects through perceptual variables. This study extends the applicability of the S–O–R model within AIGC contexts and demonstrates that semantically clear and logically structured natural language prompts can be equally effective in guiding AI video generation. The findings offer empirical support for reducing creative barriers and expanding user participation in generative media environments.},

  abstract     = {Transformers are critical equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. The condition of transformer windings critically affects their reliable operation, making fault diagnosis of transformer windings crucial. This paper proposes a transformer winding fault diagnosis method based on the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and an enhanced Swin-Transformer network model (SwinDCC). First, an experimental platform for simulating transformer winding faults was established. Using Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), characteristic curves were acquired under three fault types (axial displacement, Inter-pancake short circuit, and bulge warping) across three distinct fault regions—laying the data foundation for subsequent intelligent diagnosis. Subsequently, leveraging GAF image conversion technology, frequency response curves are transformed into GADF (Gramian Angular Difference Field) and GASF (Gramian Angular Summation Field) images. The Swin-Transformer network is then augmented with three key enhancements: Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM), Context Fusion Module (CFM), and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC). Through comparative analysis of diagnostic accuracy across different fault types and regions against baseline models, this work ultimately develops a transformer winding fault diagnosis method integrating GAF with deep neural networks. Finally, the proposed fault diagnosis method was applied to in-service transformers for comprehensive performance validation. The results demonstrate that using GADF and GASF images as input for convolutional neural networks achieved diagnostic accuracy rates exceeding 90% for both fault types and fault regions, confirming the efficacy of GADF and GASF images as input features for CNN. Experimental results indicate superior classification accuracy when utilizing GADF images as the dataset input. Specifically, the GADF-SwinDCC combination achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy, reaching 97.91% for fault types and 95.83% for fault regions. Compared to the baseline Swin-Transformer model with GADF input, the optimized SwinDCC model demonstrated significant accuracy improvements of 6.24% for fault types and 4.58% for fault regions, validating the proposed method's capability for precise diagnosis of diverse transformer winding faults across varying locations.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the length of hospital stay for patients with coronary artery disease is important for effective healthcare resource management and enhancing patient outcomes. However, to achieve a high predictive performance in machine learning, one of the key challenges is to balance exploration and exploitation during the hyperparameter tuning process. To address this challenge, this work proposes an OptiFlect Adaptive Search (OAS) optimization with XGBoost, an advanced framework designed to enhance the predictive performance of XGBoost models. Initially, data preparation and preprocessing are performed, followed by representation learning using Variational Autoencoders with t-SNE to capture complex data patterns through low-dimensional embeddings. With the transformed latent features, the proposed framework initiates a random search and then transitions to a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization, employing an adaptive switching strategy to achieve an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. The experiment is performed on three comprehensive datasets, i.e., MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU. Across these datasets, the OAS optimization algorithm achieved the best log-loss. Utilizing the optimal hyperparameters identified from OAS, the XGBoost model was retrained, resulting in superior performance with an accuracy of 97.92% on MIMIC-III, 98.99% on MIMIC-IV, and 96.58% on eICU. This model also outperformed other baseline models, achieving the highest overall and class-specific metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and AUPRC, while maintaining the lowest overall inference time as evaluated across nested five-fold cross-validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations are also performed for the OAS-XGB model's interpretability by identifying crucial predictive features, helping healthcare professionals optimize resource allocation and enhance care quality.},

These sensor data are processed in a microcontroller-based system and analyzed by applying ML algorithms in order to assess the fertility and categorize the soil.

The framework constructs a “Turbine-Weather-Operating Regime” knowledge graph where multimodal RES data including text, images, and videos are unified into entity embeddings through deep learning techniques. These embeddings enable zero-shot adaptation by identifying pre-trained models based on graph similarity, reducing the need for extensive recalibration. Additionally, a conditional clustering algorithm analyzes temporal and visual data streams simultaneously to detect high-risk operational modes, enhancing situational awareness. The framework’s innovation lies in systematically combining knowledge graph-driven meta-learning with multimodal fusion to capture complex relationships between RES dynamics and environmental factors. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional approaches, particularly under unfamiliar operational conditions.

  abstract     = {With advanced mobility and widespread accessibility, drones have attracted considerable attention, offering a wide range of applications in both military and civilian domains. Nonetheless, beyond their beneficial applications and potential, drones have given rise to serious security and privacy concerns as they are increasingly exploited for malicious activities such as drug smuggling or pose threats to individuals and public facilities. The emergence of security threats by drones has stimulated the development of countermeasure solutions including drone detection and identification. These solutions enable timely responses against security threats by facilitating the detection of drone presence and verifying their identities. In this paper, we propose more realistic audio-based drone detection and identification approaches using machine learning, which account for the presence of background environment noises, an often overlooked factor in current methods. By incorporating the interdependence between the drone’s audio and the surrounding environmental sounds, we simulate real-world scenarios where drones operate. We use drone datasets that capture these interactions to evaluate detection and identification performance. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with various kernels are employed to investigate the effectiveness of our approach across different environments. Our results demonstrate that our approach ensures reliable drone detection, achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.98 in closed-set experiments, and an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.94 in open-set experiments. For drone identification, we show the feasibility of our approach with an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.96 for only known drone classes and approximately 0.90 for both known and unknown drone classes.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, a persistent challenge remains in their tendency to hallucinate, producing content that appears credible but is factually inaccurate. This paper addresses the critical issues of hallucinations in LLMs through a multi-dimensional approach. We developed a high-quality question answering (QA) dataset spanning 15 academic disciplines, comprising 500 questions with controlled hallucination to facilitate systematic analysis. To evaluate the correspondence between generated responses and source data, we introduce a novel metric, enabling effective detection of hallucinated content. Finally, we demonstrated that incorporating external information through post-hoc retrieval procedures significantly reduces hallucination, which improves factual accuracy in responses. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Despite its effectiveness at minimizing false positives, GPT-4 exhibits moderated recall for hallucinated data, suggesting the need for continuous model evaluation and optimization. Our improved analysis proves that the use of post-hoc retrieval helps considerably to make the responses of LLM more factual, displaying large improvement in precision, recall, and F1 score of the hallucinated data. This study enhances the reliability of question-answering systems, providing scalable methods to mitigate misinformation risk and improve trustworthiness in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Panoramic radiography (PX) is widely used in dentistry but provides only a flattened 2D view; Cone Beam Computed Tomography CT (CBCT) recovers 3D anatomy at higher dose and cost. We tackle full 3D reconstruction from a single real-world PX for varying patients. We propose ViT–NeBLa (Vision-Transformer Neural Beer–Lambert), a physics-guided framework that estimates a continuous 3D dentoalveolar density field directly from single PX. The design mirrors panoramic acquisition while simplifying the inverse problem: we parameterize projection-ray directions by tangency to a patient-adaptive elliptical path and independently restrict sampling to a jaw-focused horseshoe (focal trough) in which the projection rays do not intersect. This removes the intermediate density-aggregation step used by overlapping-ray methods and reduces per-ray samples by about 52%, lowering memory and compute. A hybrid ViT–CNN backbone extracts global anatomical context and local texture from the PX, and a learnable multi-resolution hash positional encoding maps 3D sample coordinates to expressive features that preserve fine dental and osseous detail. Per-point densities are predicted by a compact MLP and accumulated into a coarse 3D grid, which a lightweight 3D U-Net refines into the final volume. Training is end-to-end using synthetic PX rendered from CBCT via the Beer–Lambert law together with voxelwise, projection-consistency, and perceptual losses; at inference, a single PX is processed directly—without CBCT flattening or dental-arch priors. Experiments show that ViT–NeBLa outperforms contemporary PX-to-3D baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, yielding sharper cortical boundaries, clearer trabecular patterns, and fewer artifacts. In sum, ViT–NeBLa provides a radiation-efficient route to clinically informative 3D visualization from routine panoramic radiographs while simplifying geometry, reducing sampling, and preserving high-frequency structure.},

Significant performance gains are achieved by analyzing the chorus—often the most expressive and repetitive part of music. Herein, a new dataset containing 9,087 tracks which are labeled by valence and arousal, is prepared and introduced. Moreover, embeddings generated by XLNet and BERT networks are compared for lyrics feature extraction.

  abstract     = {Location prediction has advanced through recommendation systems based on knowledge graphs, which excel in semantic and relational modeling. However, traditional knowledge graphs are primarily built around urban points of interest (POIs). Given that tourist activities outside the city exhibit unique patterns compared to daily urban behaviors, applying location-based knowledge graphs to tourist attraction prediction remains an ongoing research challenge. Furthermore, most studies focus on spatiotemporal data, often sidelining valuable textual information due to issues such as data scarcity and challenges in extracting meaningful semantics. To address these limitations, in our previous work, we introduced KGTR (Knowledge Graph with Tourist Reviews), a novel framework for predicting tourist attractions. Our framework goes beyond the traditional focus on temporal and spatial data by incorporating descriptive information on POIs visited by tourists, enhancing the knowledge graph’s expressiveness and semantic richness. Leveraging embeddings obtained through matrix factorization, we augmented the embeddings of locations and users with textual data to improve prediction accuracy. In this work, we compared three review embedding strategies: (a) before matrix factorization, (b) after matrix factorization, and (c) a combined before-and-after approach. To evaluate the performance, we collected a real-world tourism dataset containing POI user reviews. Results on both dense and sparse data indicate that the after factorization embedding consistently delivers the best performance. KGTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an approximately 62.0% improvement in prediction accuracy. We further explored the impact of user clustering and found that finer cluster granularity enhances recommendation accuracy by better capturing user group preferences. Notably, the proposed after factorization embedding strategy remains the most effective. Additionally, we also compare KGTR with LightGCN, a widely used model in recommendation systems. Our experiments indicate that KGTR achieves the best performance, and by using text-enhanced information after matrix factorization, KGTR improves performance by 79.9% compared to LightGCN.},

To address these issues, we propose an adaptive learning framework that integrates multi-modal sensory inputs, an Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) Kalman filter for trajectory forecasting, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for policy learning. A hybrid fusion strategy—combining early latent projection and shrinkage-enhanced cross-attention—ensures temporal-spatial alignment and suppresses noisy modalities, while a multi-objective reward balances safety, efficiency, and task success. Experiments in a high-fidelity warehouse simulator show that our method achieves a 78.5 % success rate, reducing collisions by 29 % and improving trajectory stability by 38% compared to PPO, MPC, SAC, and Transformer-based baselines. Real-time evaluation further confirms an average cycle latency of 33.3 ms, meeting industrial deployment standards. These results demonstrate that the proposed IMM-PPO framework effectively unifies predictive filtering, uncertainty-aware fusion, and reinforcement learning, enabling robust and intelligent automation for real-world logistics scenarios.},

Conversely, thermal sensors are effective in detecting heat signatures, but lack the spatial resolution required for accurate localization. To overcome these limitations, this study explores a multimodal UAV detection approach based on the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) data. We introduce a novel dataset comprising synchronized RGB and IR imagery of UAVs, captured from different viewpoints. The dataset includes recordings of several UAV models operating under various lighting and background conditions, ensuring a comprehensive benchmark for detection tasks. To present some metrics, we trained state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models on our data. The results demonstrate that by using a specific dataset, the detection accuracy can be enhanced, particularly in challenging conditions such as sunshine, sunset, and darkness, including different and variable backgrounds.

While not all negatively charged memes are harmful, sentiment analysis helps distinguish between general negativity and content that may contribute to online harms, such as cyberbullying, misinformation, or hate speech. Conventional sentiment analysis approaches, which mainly concentrate on text-based content, may miss out on nuanced emotional cues present in images, emojis, or the overall context of a conversation. Subtle negative expressions are often misclassified because models do not effectively learn fine-grained differences between sentiment classes. The existing works having static fusion often lack ability to detect fine-grained or subtle negativity. In this work we propose Gated Contrastive Multimodal Fusion Model that processes the text and image streams in memes, through independent modality-specific neural networks, combined by means of an attention mechanism. The gated fusion block present in our architecture allows the model to pay closer attention to the most sentiment-rich elements. The contrastive block provides an accurate training mechanism to improve the classification of negative memes. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our methodology provides interpretable insights into the contribution of each modality.

All steps require a suitable perception of the environment conditions, such as the estimation of the own position, a prediction of the trajectories of other traffic participants, or the assessment of parameters corresponding to vehicle dynamics. However, classical estimation algorithms are known to be easily distorted by outliers in the data. In addition, apart from rule-based systems, it becomes more convenient to train autonomous agents by machine learning algorithms. Again, such algorithms need to be robust in order to cope with model misspecification or outliers in the data. Robust Statistics is a discipline of statistics which exactly addresses these challenges.

Without proper asset management methods, the grid may not adequately support the ongoing climate-centered electrification of society. This highlights the need for strategic asset maintenance decision-making. While the existing literature includes inventive approaches for reliability modeling and maintenance strategy selection, there is still a gap in integrating detailed predictive analytics-based reliability modeling that accounts for common data deficiencies, alongside maintenance strategies that consider both reliability and cost-based performance indicators. In this paper, we present a comprehensive proactive cable replacement method using the Neural Weibull Proportional Hazard model, specifically designed to handle truncation and censoring mechanisms. The method employs a Bayesian nested Monte Carlo simulation to address the dual uncertainties associated with the probabilistic reliability model. We apply this maintenance simulation method to a case study of a real distribution system in Denmark. Our results indicate that the optimal replacement strategy reduces outage costs by up to 6.16 million DKK and can decrease the SystemAverage Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) by more than 50% compared to alternative replacement strategies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the maintenance budget shows that operators can reduce their annual budget for cable replacements by up to 50%, incurring only minor additional costs and an increase in peak SAIDI of just 1.5 minutes. The innovation lies in combining the NWPH model with Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation to handle incomplete records, quantify uncertainty, and guide cost-effective maintenance decisions.},

  abstract     = {Water resource management remains a critical challenge globally, exacerbated by climate change, urbanization, and inefficient resource allocation. Predicting groundwater availability plays a crucial role in mitigating these challenges, especially in regions facing water scarcity. This study leverages the Comment Feedback Optimization Algorithm (CFOA) to enhance deep learning models for groundwater resource prediction. We propose a binary version of CFOA (bCFOA) for feature selection, which significantly improves the prediction performance of the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model. The baseline LightGBM model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.045470041. After applying bCFOA for feature selection, the model’s performance improved with an average error of 0.41055. Furthermore, the integration of CFOA for hyperparameter optimization of LightGBM resulted in an impressive MSE of 6.11673E-06, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy. To further assess the robustness, efficiency, and interpretability of the proposed framework, an extensive ablation study was conducted. This included sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters (Z0, K0, λ), complexity evaluation of various metaheuristic variants, and cluster-based visual diagnostics. The study revealed not only the importance of parameter stability and search behavior, but also offered evidence of CFOA’s superior convergence and resource efficiency relative to competing approaches.

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects and managing occlusions remain persistent challenges in object detection tasks, particularly in complex scenarios with diverse environments or densely packed scenes. These challenges often result in poor detection accuracy and limited model generalization across varying datasets. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods: Object-Oriented Cutout (OOC) and Selective Grid Loss Function (SGLoss). OOC enhances training data diversity while preserving small object integrity by strategically applying object-aware augmentation. SGLoss optimizes grid cell allocation dynamically based on object size and aspect ratio, ensuring the generation of high-quality positive samples while reducing inconsistencies in grid-level assignments, and further enabling precise alignment between anchors and ground truth boxes for improved detection accuracy across scales. Our proposed methods achieve a 0.6% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to the YOLOv5 baseline, with significant gains observed across small and occluded object categories in datasets such as VisDrone 2019, DOTA, MS COCO 2017, PASCAL VOC, and SODA10M. These contributions advance the field of object detection by addressing critical limitations and provide a foundation for future research in diverse domains, including autonomous driving, aerial imagery analysis, and real-time surveillance systems.},

  abstract     = {The application of autonomous driving in agriculture poses unique challenges compared to urban autonomous vehicles. Unlike structured roads with clear signals, agricultural environments feature unstructured, irregular terrains requiring precise perception and high-level decision-making. Current autonomous agricultural machines primarily rely on LiDAR, which detects object distance and shape with high accuracy. However, LiDAR systems are computationally expensive due to large data volumes and complex processing. This paper proposes dilated group convolution network (DG-Net), a lightweight deep learning model for real-time farmland segmentation. DG-Net incorporates DG-blocks, combining dilated and group convolutions, and an upsampling module using pixel shuffle. DG-blocks expand the receptive field to extract contextual features, which are connected to the decoder via skip connections. The decoder restores resolution using pixel shuffle by rearranging low-resolution feature maps into high-resolution outputs. DG-Net achieves a pixel accuracy of 75.1% and a mIoU of 77.7%, surpassing the state-of-the-art segment anything model – vision transformer base (SAM-ViT-B) by 2.5% in mean intersection over union (mIoU) while using fewer parameters and maintaining lightweight computational cost. These results demonstrate DG-Net’s applicability for efficient and accurate real-time farmland perception.},

In this research paper, we conduct a quantitative analysis of centralization in the Lightning Network using various centrality metrics, such as Gini coefficient, Nakamoto coefficient, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Theil Index and Shannon entropy. The proposed methodology includes data collection, clustering nodes into entities and setting up the experimental environment. The quantitative analysis of centralization in the BLN reveals complex results, with the Gini coefficient for node capacity distribution increasing from 0.85 to 0.97 over eight yearly timestamps, indicating growing inequality. Meanwhile, the Nakamoto coefficient fluctuated, suggesting that while control over network resources is uneven, it may still be more decentralized than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent complexity of modern polymer extrusion lines caused by nonlinear, dynamic behavior with numerous influential factors, disturbances lead to higher scrap rates and downtimes. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to address this challenge rely on independent models and local control loops, neglecting the multistage characteristic of extrusion lines and therefore, cannot obtain a global optimum. Consequently, we propose a predictive control design based on a nonlinear and autoregressive multi-task learning model covering the entire extrusion line including local control loops and essential quality measurements. Training on an extended prediction horizon successfully addresses accumulating prediction errors and measurement noise. Due to its capability to predict state trajectories for up to 60 minutes, the proposed methodology enables effective model predictive control. Additionally, using an efficient method for adaptive error compensation based on previous error trajectories increases robustness substantially while the hierarchical control architecture supports global optimization and efficient local control loops. The proposed control design is validated on two polymer extrusion lines. The results show that changing operating points and optimizing process states, such as melt temperature, can be reliably achieved in spite of process disturbances. In comparison to baseline production periods, dominant oscillations are successfully damped by 62 %, reference values are closely followed and process variations are reduced by 41 % to 63 % improving product quality notably. A comparative analysis of disturbance rejection capabilities shows superior results while empirical analyses of stability and runtime further improve its closed-loop applicability. As a consequence, the proposed methodology for predictive control allows to steer extrusion processes accurately, address upcoming issues in advance and generally leads to more efficient processes.},

A major challenge in this domain is the presence of noisy data, which can substantially reduce the performance of classification algorithms. Existing studies often ignore the ordinal nature of class labels during noise detection, which may lead to suboptimal data cleaning. To address this problem, we propose a new approach entitled Random Tree with Ordinal Noise Filtering and Feature Selection (RTONF). This method explicitly incorporates the inherent order of class labels (e.g., poor < fair < good < very good < excellent) during the noise identification process, before predicting student performance or satisfaction. The Random Tree (RT) algorithm serves as the base classifier, while Pearson Correlation is employed for feature selection due to its outstanding performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid method with an average accuracy of 84.61% achieved a 5.23% improvement compared to the traditional RT classifier. Furthermore, comparative analysis indicated that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of prediction accuracy on the same dataset.},

  abstract     = {Effective inventory management of cleaning resources is crucial for operational efficiency in industries like healthcare and hospitality, where demand fluctuates due to seasonal changes and unexpected events. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to predict these dynamic demands accurately. To address this, we introduce CleanStockNet, a novel forecasting framework combining Gated Linear Unit Convolution-Enhanced and Temporal Attention Fusion Network, designed to enhance prediction accuracy for cleaning resource stocks over a 16-day forecast horizon. CleanStockNet integrates the Gated Linear Unit architecture with a dual-stage temporal attention mechanism, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. This capability is crucial for handling irregular inventory demand patterns. The model processes historical data across 1 to 96 window intervals, adapting to long temporal patterns and improving prediction granularity. Our comprehensive evaluation using the SPGTCLEN (Singapore General Hospital Time Series of Cleaning Inventory), CELS (Centralized Environmental Logistics System), and ICLN (Integrated Cleaning Logistics Network) datasets shows that CleanStockNet significantly outperforms traditional methods. The model demonstrated an R-square accuracy above 0.87, with the highest result at the 4th step prediction (0.988). It also achieved a reduction in Mean Square Error (MSE) by over 20% and R² values above 0.9, indicating an exceptional fit to data variability. These results highlight CleanStockNet's potential to revolutionize inventory management by providing highly accurate, reliable forecasts that can significantly enhance decision-making in resource management and planning. This framework sets a new benchmark in predictive analytics for inventory management and offers potential applications across other sectors facing similar challenges.},

  abstract     = {Precise short-term forecasting of electricity load is essential to ensure the consistent and dependable functioning of power systems.Yet, the intricate and evolving relationships among load sequences and various external variables (e.g., temperature, electricity cost) present major difficulties in multivariate modeling. Existing graph-based forecasting models typically construct graphs based on variables or time points, but often neglect local spatio-temporal patterns, making it difficult to capture rapid feature variations within short time windows. Moreover, due to the multi-periodic nature of load sequences, their correlations with external features vary across time scales, further reducing forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-scale Dynamic Patch Graph Neural Network (MDPGNN). In the local channel, the model constructs patch-level graphs and integrates dynamic graph learning with adaptive graph convolution to jointly model the internal structure of load sequences and their multi-scale dependencies with external features. In the global channel, a global correlation graph is designed to preserve long-range temporal patterns and inter-variable relationships. Furthermore, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism is employed to effectively fuse multi-scale dependencies and the outputs of both local and global channels. Experimental results on two real-world load datasets show that MDPGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.},

To ensure data quality, conventional approaches discard severely compressed images. While this preserves image quality, it reduces data diversity, which in turn limits model performance. To address this issue, we propose RECA (Refinement of Compressed Artifacts), a novel pipeline that enables the reuse of JPEG images that would otherwise be excluded. RECA first detects heavily compressed images using a blockiness measure, then restores visual quality using a real-world diffusion-based SR model, and finally applies bicubic downsampling to suppress artifacts introduced during enhancement. This process allows the effective inclusion of compressed images in training without sacrificing data quality. Experimental results demonstrate that RECA consistently outperforms filtering-based baselines in terms of PSNR and SSIM. These findings highlight the effectiveness of RECA in expanding usable training data and improving SR model performance.},

Due to the strong sensitivity of lithium batteries to environment temperature, the launch characteristics of the lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher also exhibit significant fluctuations with environmental temperature. To address this issue, the research was conducted. Firstly, a dynamic launch theoretical model of the reluctance launcher was established based on the Law of Energy Conservation to analyze the mechanism of temperature's impact on launch characteristics; Secondly, an experimental-simulation integrated modeling method was employed, where circuit parameter measurement experiments were carried out using a constant temperature chamber, and the test results were used as inputs for the simulation model to evaluate the influence characteristics of temperature on the launcher's performance; Finally, practical launch experiments were conducted to obtain the mapping relationship between temperature and launcher velocity. Research indicates that temperature exerts a nonlinear influence on the muzzle velocity and system efficiency of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launchers. When environment temperature ranges from 15 °C to 30 °C, both muzzle velocity and system efficiency exhibit minimal fluctuations while maintaining high performance levels. At temperatures dropping to -5 °C and -15 °C, muzzle velocity decreases to 70.77 % and 30.4 % of its peak value, with system efficiency reduced to 91 % and 41.1 % of its original level, respectively. The results show that temperature significantly influences the launching characteristics of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher.

To overcome the challenge of insufficient SSS data, we propose an enhanced Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, integrating Shape-Adaptive Convolution (SAConv) and Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) modules to generate SSS images. Specifically, SAConv improves structural consistency and contour integrity of the synthesized images by adapting convolutional kernels to object shapes, while MSHA enhances texture fidelity and spatial detail by capturing both local and global contextual information at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated sonar images outperform the baseline CycleGAN, achieving improvements of 8.2% in PSNR, 30.2% in SSIM, 3.8% in LPIPS, 5.1% in FID, and 29.9% in KID.

The proposed mixed voltage-current mode approach enables voltage signal acquisition at the input stage, followed by current-domain processing in subsequent stages. A discrete PCB prototype was developed using AD844 operational amplifiers to emulate both CCII and VCII behavior. Signal acquisition was performed using a range of custom-designed 3D-printed passive and active electrodes fabricated with copper-based conductive filament, whose contact impedance variability was also characterized. The performance of the proposed interface was experimentally evaluated and compared against commercial EEG analog front-end chips such as the ADS1298, ADS1299, AD630, and other microelectronic circuits. The current-mode implementation demonstrates significant advantages, including high input impedance (ranging from 300 MΩ to 6.49 TΩ), excellent common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR > 100 dB), and a tunable bandwidth (0.1–200 Hz).

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic review of positioning technologies and antenna designs for indoor and outdoor applications. The indoor positioning analysis focuses on RF-based systems including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ultra-wideband (UWB), Wi-Fi, and ZigBee, examining their operational principles, measurement techniques (e.g., RSSI, ToA, AoA), and implementation challenges. For outdoor environments, the review covers Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, alongside regional navigation satellite systems (RNSS) including NavIC, QZSS, detailing their constellation architectures, frequency bands, signal bandwidths, and positioning methods (e.g., SPP, DGNSS, RTK, PPP). A comprehensive evaluation of antenna technologies addresses conventional designs (e.g., survey grade choke ring, cavity-backed annular slots, microstrip patches) and wearable implementations (e.g., textile-based, flexible substrates), emphasizing multipath mitigation, miniaturization, and body interaction effects. The work highlights the critical relationship between positioning system performance and antenna characteristics, including radiation patterns, gain, polarization and SAR. By integrating these technical aspects, this review serves as a unified reference for state-of-the-art localization systems and their associated antennas, highlighting practical implementation constraints across different operational environments. A general guideline is provided for future works in the field of flexible wearable antennas to maintain higher efficiency of operation with reliable characteristics to suit positioning applications.},

  abstract     = {Offshore wind farms have emerged as a crucial component of renewable energy generation, offering higher energy production rates due to stronger and more consistent wind conditions. However, these advantages come with significant installation and maintenance costs, necessitating comprehensive optimization analyses of wind farms projects to ensure economic feasibility and maximize energy output. One of the most significant challenges in this context is the effective placement of wind turbines within an offshore wind farm, considering the historic wind intensity and direction of candidate areas, along with the impact of wake effects. This study presents a framework that integrates a genetic algorithm to optimize wind farms layouts with a simulation tool for evaluating configurations of wind farm projects. In this paper, we describe the optimization module implemented with genetic algorithms. Our approach aims to facilitate layouts optimization analysis for wind farms during the project phase, focusing on maximizing overall energy output by minimizing wake interference among turbines. The proposed approach demonstrates high modularity and achieves competitive results compared to established benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework for optimization analysis in wind farm projects.},

  abstract     = {Frequency instability of an isolated microgrid (IMG) often arises due to load variations and uncertain power outputs of renewable sources. This contribution addresses the frequency instability issue by designing a Padula and Visioli (PV) tuned proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for IMG. The considered IMG model is novel due to the integration of eco-friendly generation sources, including a biogas turbine generator (BTG) and a biodiesel engine generator (BEG), along with other distributed generation units (DGUs) and energy storage devices (ESDs). In this contribution, mathematical modeling of considered units is derived as first-order model. Further, an overall transfer function of the IMG system is obtained using first-order transfer functions of IMG components and system dynamics. Thus, the obtained transfer function is then approximated into a first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) model to facilitate a simpler PID control design. PID controller parameters are computed using PV method for set point (SP) and load disturbance (LD) modes, keeping maximum sensitivity as a constraint. Various PID controller i.e. PID-PVSP1.4, PID-PVSP2.0, PID-PVLD1.4, and PID-PVLD2.0 is designed for SP and LD modes. The efficacy of PID control design is tested by analyzing its impact on frequency deviation and mitigation of error with acceptable transient response for SP and LD mode. A comparative study is also performed based on tabulated data featuring error indices, time domain indicators, control efforts, and frequency plots to validate PV method-based PID control designs for IMG. Moreover, the real-time simulator, i.e., OPAL-RT, is utilized to further validate the efficacy of the PID controller in frequency error mitigation of the considered IMG model.},

  abstract     = {Background and Aim: The design of secure systems that can protect sensitive data is becoming a major area of research due to the growing number of applications that use the Internet. In mobile banking applications which use face recognition as unlock feature, the face data is encrypted and protected in a dedicated chip within the device called Secure Enclave that enhances the security of the application. This cutting-edge development is now being used by individuals in their personal devices like smartphones and tablets for accessing their own bank accounts and to perform online transactions. Since encrypted face data is stored locally on devices rather than in the bank’s database, it remains susceptible to security breaches, potentially allowing unauthorized access. While face recognition systems provide benefits like enhanced security, surveillance, and personalized marketing, they also raise privacy, security, ethical, and legal concerns. To address these challenges, this study proposes an encryption method for applications employing face recognition as an authentication feature. Methodology: The proposed method encrypts facial encodings generated by the face recognition model by utilizing Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as a dynamic key generation source. This approach ensures unique encryption for each communication, significantly reducing vulnerability to attacks. One of the widely used face recognition models in mobile applications is Dlib’s face recognition model which provides accurate facial embeddings. Results and Conclusion: The method is evaluated using the ‘‘pins_dataset’’ containing 10,000 images of 100 unique identities and an accuracy of 90.1% is achieved. The same accuracy is observed when testing face recognition without encrypting the facial encodings, demonstrating efficacy of the encryption algorithm. Additionally, the encryption algorithm’s time complexity is evaluated as O(1), confirming its ability to perform encryption with constant time complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {In the growing field of human-centric artificial intelligence, the integration of computational methods with artistic and cultural practices is emerging as a promising area of exploration. Traditional design workflows often depend on manual expertise and fixed patterns, which restrict flexibility, personalization, and large-scale application. Earlier computational models also face difficulties in capturing both the semantic depth and visual detail needed for creative outputs that are truly adaptive and authentic. To address these limitations, we present a new multi-module framework built on a series of deep learning components. This includes a generative adversarial network enhanced with feature injection, an aesthetic-aware filtering mechanism, and a texture refinement unit that adapts to dynamic inputs. The framework is further strengthened by a dual encoding strategy that aligns visual style with contextual meaning across different design themes. Experimental results on both standard benchmarks and custom-built datasets show that our method achieves better visual consistency and thematic accuracy than existing approaches. This progress not only supports automated content generation with cultural relevance but also contributes to the broader goal of developing context-aware and interdisciplinary artificial intelligence systems. Experimental evaluations were conducted on four benchmark datasets: WikiArt, Textile Pattern, Behance Artistic Media, and iMaterialist, encompassing tasks related to cultural pattern recognition, process failure prediction, and load balancing. On theWikiArt dataset, our method achieved an accuracy of 91.74%, an F1 score of 89.21%, and an AUC of 93.07%, outperforming established baselines such as CLIP and BLIP by margins of 3-4% in key metrics. Similarly, on the Textile Pattern dataset, the model reached 90.32% accuracy with an AUC of 90.61%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex temporal and spatial correlations in handcrafted weaving data. In the Behance Artistic Media dataset, which focuses on failure prediction in creative workflows, our model achieved an F1 score of 87.15% and an AUC of 90.28%, surpassing competing models in robustness against imbalanced data scenarios. Finally, on the iMaterialist dataset related to production load balancing, the model recorded 91.26% accuracy and 92.17% AUC. These quantitative outcomes substantiate the proposed framework’s capacity to deliver superior visual consistency, thematic alignment, and predictive reliability across diverse and culturally enriched datasets. The integration of multi-scale attention mechanisms and culturally annotated training corpora directly contributes to these results, highlighting the framework’s potential in advancing AI-assisted craft design through quantifiable performance gains.},

  abstract     = {Mobile government (M-Gov) applications have become essential platforms for delivering public services, with usability directly influencing user access, trust, and digital inclusion. However, most prior studies on M-Gov usability rely on top-down evaluation methods, such as heuristic assessments or standardized frameworks (e.g., ISO, SUS), which often miss the complex, context-sensitive nature of M-Gov user interaction. This study addresses this gap by adopting a bottom-up, user-centered approach to identify usability issues that arise during actual use of the M-Gov service. Usability data was collected through think-aloud protocols, post-task reflections, and post-study questionnaires. Inductive thematic analysis revealed eight interrelated usability themes, each composed of sub-themes that captured specific issues, resulting in a total of sixteen sub-themes. The core usability issues are: Task Flow Disruptions, Navigation Difficulties, Content Issues, Performance Issues, Support Limitations, Ineffective Error Feedback, Interface Design Issues, Accessibility Barriers. This approach shows how usability challenges emerge and escalate during service interactions. The findings reveal gaps in user behavior alignment, clear communication, and accessibility, especially for older users or people with limited digital skills. The study contributes to M-Gov usability research by offering a structured taxonomy of observed usability failures and extends current evaluation practices by offering a behaviorally grounded view of usability in M-Gov apps and informing more inclusive and reliable digital service design.},

To address this limitation, we propose a time-domain sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework that enables CIR estimation independently of the source frequency band. Unlike existing frequency-domain SBL approaches, the proposed method formulates the estimation problem as a time-domain linear system and incorporates off-grid modeling along with multiple measurements to achieve high-resolution results. The performance of the method is evaluated through simulations across varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of measurements, and compared against conventional MF and on-grid SBL techniques. Its effectiveness is further validated using real-world experimental data collected in a shallow water environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves temporal resolution, enhances denoising performance, and successfully resolves closely spaced arrivals that are otherwise indistinguishable.},

The proposed electric spring topology gives the system seamless performance with linear, non-linear, and unbalanced load conditions. The electric spring in this work is equipped with a modified complex coefficient filter, which eliminates the harmonics and the unbalanced negative sequence component from the system currents caused by unbalanced loads. The performance of the proposed electric spring was evaluated with non-linear loads, unbalanced critical load, and unbalanced non-critical load. The proposed electric spring works effectively to regulate the system voltage and frequency within 2% tolerance limits. In the presence of non-linear loads, the THD of the generator current could be reduced to 1.97%, proving the electric spring’s efficacy as an active filter. The modified complex coefficient filter-based shunt side control strategy effectively eliminates the unbalanced current components from the system currents, which keeps the self-excited induction generator unaffected by load imbalances caused by both the critical load and non-critical load sides. The shunt side control strategy also effectively maintained the DC link voltage fluctuation within 16V, which is 6.4% of the rated value of 250V. The proposed minimum voltage injection control strategy to control the series converter was highly effective in maintaining a constant voltage of 230V during unbalanced non-critical load conditions. The real-time validation of the proposed work is done with OPAL-RT 4510 and 4520 platforms, and the detailed results and their analysis are presented in this work.},

  abstract     = {Modern Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)attacks increasingly target the application layer to exhaust CPU resources and disrupt service availability, particularly in containerized environments where isolation and diverse implementations complicate traditional detection mechanisms. Existing solutions like CODA(Containerized Denial-of-Service Attack detection) monitor CPU burst times between accept() and close() system calls but fail when attackers maintain persistent connections without triggering close() calls. To address this limitation, we propose CODAX (Container-aware DDoS Attack detection using eXtended Berkeley Packet Filter), a lightweight CPU-time-based detection method that identifies longrunning malicious connections by monitoring system calls at the kernel level using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) probes. Unlike prior methods such as CODA that rely on measuring CPU burst time between accept() and close() system calls, our approach tracks CPU usage thresholds from the moment of the accept() call using a global map of 64-bit Unix timestamps, enabling early detection of ongoing attacks before connection closure. The experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing solutions. The proposed system achieves faster detection times, high attack detection accuracy (ADR: 0.92), and maintains low false positive rates (FPR: 0.02). Statistical validation using paired t-tests confirms that our eBPF-based approach reduces detection latency by an average of 1,772.3ms compared to CODA, representing a 94.2% relative reduction from CODA’s baseline performance (p<0.0001). The system operates efficiently with 30% CPU utilization and demonstrates high scalability for production environments. This research provides a timely and efficient mechanism for mitigating CPU exhaustion DDoS attacks in containerized applications, offering substantial improvements in responsiveness and reliability over existing detection frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Weather prediction is a challenging task, particularly in dealing with the diverse geography and weather patterns of various Indian cities throughout the year. This research presents an optimized hybrid model (OHM) that combines long-short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models to increase the prediction performance for weather variables. The primary objective was to provide accurate weather forecasts for various Indian cities, which contributes to better disaster management, better agricultural sector, and daily lives of people. Weather forecasting was conducted for multiple Indian cities using advanced hybrid models and traditional machine learning algorithms. Data were collected, pre-processed, benchmarked against existing algorithms, and the results were evaluated. OHM was trained and tested using open source Kaggle weather data covering several Indian cities. The proposed hybrid model took advantage of the capabilities of LSTM and transformer to learn temporal dependencies, enhance feature extraction, and manage long-range dependencies more effectively. The OHM was compared with standard machine learning models, comprising random forest, XGBoost, support vector regression, linear regression, and an isolated LSTM model. The results showed an increase of 0.2°C in the average annual temperature over the next 10 years and a variation in rainfall of 8% during the monsoon season.

  abstract     = {Effective remote collaboration in eXtended Reality (XR) requires realistic and interactive 3D spaces, but existing systems are often hindered by complex setups, such as specialized sensors or pre-made 3D models, limiting their accessibility. To challenge these limitations, we propose a novel remote XR collaboration system that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) to reconstruct high-fidelity environments on-the-fly during collaboration, using only a standard RGB camera on the commercial XR device. The core of our system is an interaction technique we term ’Interactive Gaussian Clipping,’ which enables users to instantly clip manipulable, photorealistic ’Gaussian Replicas’ from any part of the newly generated scene. Then, the Gaussian Replicas are copied and shared between remote collaborators instantly. This approach eliminates the need for prior 3D modeling and specialized hardware, significantly lowering the barrier to remote collaboration. We validated the proposed approach through a within-subject user study (N=28) that compared the effectiveness of our Gaussian Replica (GR) method against a conventional 3D sketching (3DS) baseline in a collaborative assembly task. The results show that the GR method led to significantly faster task completion, a lower cognitive load, and a higher usability for local users. Furthermore, a majority of the participants (93%) preferred the GR method. Our work demonstrates a practical and accessible direction towards more effective and immersive remote collaboration, highlighting the potential of user-driven GS interaction in HCI.},

  abstract     = {In remote sensing change detection tasks, significant cross-domain data distribution discrepancies severely weaken model adaptability, especially in scenarios where the target domain lacks labels. Existing methods struggle to effectively address domain shifts under such unsupervised conditions. To tackle this, this paper proposes SwinGAN-CD, an unsupervised cross-domain change detection method that uses the Swin Transformer as the feature extraction backbone combined with adversarial networks. By introducing the long-range dependency modeling capability of the Swin Transformer as the encoder and constructing a joint discriminator to align multi-dimensional feature spaces between the source and target domains, the method effectively enhances the model’s cross-domain recognition ability for change regions. Furthermore, a Self-Attention based Discriminator (SA-D) is proposed to enable more thorough and efficient feature alignment during adversarial training. Additionally, a Dual-space Feature Alignment (DFA) strategy tailored for change detection tasks is introduced to specifically align global features and change features across pre- and post-event phases, thereby improving detection accuracy. Cross-domain experiments conducted on the WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and stronger robustness under unsupervised conditions compared to existing approaches, attaining F1 scores of 82.71% and 79.04%, respectively, both of which are state-of-the-art. This study provides an effective unsupervised solution for cross-domain change detection in remote sensing.},

The approach ultimately enables high-resolution mapping of traffic-induced loads, as required for digital twins. The method relies on timestamps and positions of distributed sensor detections and proceeds in three steps: clustering sensor signals, reconstructing wheel trajectories via binary optimization, and rule-based vehicle identification based on geometric and kinematic consistency. The method targets key characteristics of real-world traffic data, including unknown vehicle geometries and varying speeds. In the evaluated dataset from a research-grade Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) installation on a German highway, the method achieved 100% precision and recall in wheel tracking and near-perfect results in vehicle identification.

Due to the fluctuating and intermittent nature of wind resources, it is very challenging to accurately forecast wind power under varying scenarios. This paper proposes a novel Double Bayesian Multi-Task Gaussian Process (B²MTGP) model tailored for wind turbine power forecasting with scarce data. The model leverages both wind speed and limited power data, employing a two-stage Bayesian inference framework: the first stage integrates discrete wavelet packet decomposition to denoise raw signals, enhancing prediction accuracy; the second stage optimizes the multi-task Gaussian process model structure and parameters to account for data uncertainty. A generalized procedure is developed to facilitate automatic implementation of the proposed method for small-sample forecasting scenarios. Comparative experiments using real-world wind turbine datasets demonstrate that B²MTGP significantly outperforms traditional Gaussian process regression and multi-task models, achieving up to 91% improvement in point prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for robust and reliable wind power forecasting under data uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {As generative AI advances, the realism of synthetic media has sparked serious concerns in security, privacy, and misinformation. This issue is particularly concerning with the rise of deepfake technologies that manipulate facial imagery, undermining media authenticity. While existing research has largely focused on image-based deepfake detection with specialized feature extractors, detecting deepfakes in video, especially with broad generalization across varied manipulation techniques, remains a substantial challenge. This paper introduces EVDO, a novel framework designed to detect deepfake videos by integrating temporal and spatial analysis for enhanced detection accuracy. Our approach leverages optical flow techniques to capture subtle temporal manipulation artifacts between video frames overlooked in spatial analysis. Using a FlowFormer++ model for temporal analysis, frame pairs are sampled to produce cost volumes that highlight essential motion regions and capture manipulation-specific artifacts through optical flow images which encode temporal dependencies. A flow-finetuned detector then extracts flow-level features indicative of deepfake manipulation. Complementing this, Xception-based spatial detectors analyze each frame individually, generating high-dimensional embeddings that capture frame-specific anomalies. Fusing these temporal and spatial embeddings enables comprehensive binary classification of deepfakes. Validated on the FaceForensics++ benchmark, EVDO significantly improves generalization. Our proposed temporal path contributes correct classifications to around 12% of datapoints. EVDO achieves a video AUC of 99.13% (99.43% of end-to-end SOTA methods) while enabling forensically verifiable manipulation detection.},

Traditional methods, which are based on empirical models and simple regression techniques, struggle to capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of industrial systems, resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this study, we propose a Margin-enhanced Dual Feature Net (MeDFN) that integrates deep feature extraction using a compact transformer-based module with shallow feature extraction via linear regression, further enhanced by a quantile-based additive interval loss function to improve feature discriminability. Experimental evaluations on a modular hydrothermal liquefaction system (MHTLS) cross-flow heat exchanger reveal that MeDFN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.291 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.392, outperforming benchmark methods. In addition, on a plate-fin heat exchanger dataset, MeDFN attains MAE values of 1.906 for the cold fluid outlet temperature (T2) and 0.187 for the hot fluid outlet temperature (T4), demonstrating robust generalization across different configurations. These results underscore the potential of MeDFN in advancing thermal management and enhancing operational efficiency in industrial applications.},

Cognitive cybersecurity systems present the opportunity to provide answers to threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and anomaly detection since they combine the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with human knowledge. Ensemble machine learning is especially effective among AI methods because it will be able to enable prediction stability and accuracy through the aggregation of multiple classifiers. However, dynamic vulnerability assessments are difficult to perform on heterogeneous data volumes created in security operations centers, relying only on real-time data. The vulnerability scan is done manually, and it demands highly skilled analysts who need to go through a time-consuming process with cumulative results, and therefore the security repositories available still carry too much inconsistent information, and this leads to wastage of time in detecting the flaws. To address these issues, this paper proposes a cognitive cybersecurity framework powered by ensemble machine learning for real-time vulnerability detection and dynamic threat assessment.

Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving survival rates through timely treatment. However, current detection methods face challenges such as invasiveness, high costs, and delayed diagnosis. Eelectrochemical biosensors, which use potentiostats to detect biological analytes by controlling cell voltage and measuring current, voltage, or impedance, offer a rapid and sensitive alternative. Nevertheless, many existing potentiostats are limited by narrow voltage ranges, single current measurement capabilities, and inadequate support for advanced electrochemical techniques. This study presents a novel wireless electrochemical biosensor potentiostat system enhanced with machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) integration for the detection of lung cancer biomarkers, specifically the CD63 protein. The system is designed to be portable, energy efficient, cost-effective, and high sensitive, supporting advanced electrochemicals techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). It achieves a limit of detection (LoD) of 2 × 101 particles/mL and a sensitivity of 5.188 μA per log concentration unit, comparable to the commercial systems like uStat8000 potentiostat. Furthermore, the integrated random forest classifier enables fast and automated data interpretation, achieving accuracy rates of 83.5% and 87.5% for CV and SWV cases, respectively. Overall, the developed platform offers a smart, portable, and scalable solution for point-of-care diagnostics, contributing to early detection and improved prognosis in lung cancer management.},

  abstract     = {In wireless transceivers, the power amplifier (PA) is the most power-consuming and critical component, as it must meet stringent linearity and reliability requirements while maintaining high efficiency. Traditionally, PAs are implemented using a common-source (CS) configuration. However, recent studies have explored the common-drain amplifier (CDA) as a promising PA topology, offering advantages in stress handling and linearity. Since the CDA is inherently a current amplifier, it can be integrated with a CS amplifier to form a hybrid common-source common-drain (CSCD) configuration. Despite its potential, limited research has been conducted on CDA-based or CDA-inspired PAs. This work introduces a novel approach by employing the CDA as a foundation for developing CSCD PAs, thereby opening new avenues in CMOS PA design. Using a 130-nm RFCMOS process, a CSCD amplifier was fabricated and packaged in QFN-32. The amplifier achieves a saturated output power (Psat) of 31 dBm and a power gain of 10 dB at a center frequency of 706 MHz, with a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 39%. To further validate the concept, wideband 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) signals were applied to evaluate linearity and output power. Under a 16-QAM, 20 MHz UTRA signal, the amplifier delivers 28.1 dBm output power with an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of –30 dBc and an error vector magnitude (EVM) below –30 dBc, maintaining an average efficiency of 26%. The design meets LTE performance standards, demonstrating strong potential for robust, high-efficiency RF amplification in wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification have demonstrated impressive classification performance, often relying on deep neural networks. However, such approaches remain too computationally intensive for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices. In this work, we revisit Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) and show that a simple one-hidden-layer FCNN can achieve competitive performance, requiring at least 5× fewer FLOPs and inference time than state-of-the-art architectures, with only a marginal drop in F1-score (0.02% to 0.21% depending on the dataset, for 16 transmitters or fewer). More importantly, our results reveal that despite their simplicity, our FCNNs exhibit comparable resilience to channel and device variability comparable to more complex architectures. This suggests that the current emphasis on increasing model size may be misguided. Rather than continuously increasing model depth or sophistication, our results highlight the importance of reexamining how datasets are designed and used in evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Conventional burst-mode control for an LLC resonant converter improves the light load efficiency, but it suffers from dynamic problems such as output voltage dip during load transients due to discontinuous operation. Although there have been several approaches improving the light load efficiency without regulation or dynamic problems, they still reveal limitations such as topology dependency or distortion on the resonant current waveform. This paper proposes a continuously operating burst-mode control (COBC) for a half-bridge LLC resonant converter, inserting multiple freewheeling intervals in light load conditions. By doing so, COBC maintains sinusoidal waveform, thereby achieving higher efficiency even in a very light condition while maintaining superior dynamic response. In addition, detailed time-domain analysis has been conducted to provide the design guideline for the proposed COBC with a wide range of resonant tank values. Therefore, the proposed COBC can be implemented to pre-designed half-bridge LLC converters implemented by engineers, preventing the side effects such as the saturation of magnetic components. The effectiveness of the COBC is verified with 400 – 300 V input and 50 V/5 A output prototype. The COBC improves the light load efficiency by up to 4.35 % compared with conventional pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control and reduces the voltage dip during a 10 % to 100 % load transient by 36.1 % compared with conventional burst-mode control.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a high-accuracy radar parameter estimation method for extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, integrating deep learning and connected component analysis (CCA). Accurate estimation of parameters such as time of arrival, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, bandwidth, and carrier frequency is critical for various applications, but remains challenging under high noise conditions. The proposed method consists of three key steps. First, frequency-domain pulse detection isolates radar signals from noise-contaminated samples. Second, time-frequency analysis using short-time Fourier transform is followed by UNet-based denoising and CCA to suppress noise and enhance signal features. Finally, edge-based parameter computation is applied to extract signal boundaries and estimate parameters precisely. Simulation results show that the method achieves approximately 3 dB improvement in time-domain estimation accuracy and lower root mean square error in frequency-domain parameters compared to conventional methods, across SNR levels from –20 dB to 10 dB. Test-bed experiments using Universal Software Radio Peripheral and GNURadio further validate its robustness, especially at –5 dB SNR. These findings confirm the method’s practical viability for reliable radar signal processing in challenging low-SNR environments.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by offering human-like responses. However, issues such as incorrect information (hallucinations) and errors in specific subject areas remain, especially in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This study introduces a Context-Aware Retrieval Augmented Generation (CA-RAG), which simplifies the process by removing the need to separately find relevant chunks of a document. Instead, after dividing the document into chunks, both the question and chunks are directly given to the LLMs to produce answers. The method then focuses on improving the answers through additional post-processing, aiming to reduce errors and make the answers more relevant to the question. To evaluate the effectiveness of CA-RAG, two scenarios have been designed. Scenario 1 involved experiments using widely adopted and recognized benchmark datasets, such as TriviaQA, Natural Questions, AmbigQA and Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). In this context, the proposed CA-RAG method, combined with similarity measure (either cosine similarity or dot product) between generated answers and chunks, achieved the highest F1-score in TriviaQA and AmbigQA. Scenario 2 tested CA-RAG robustness using a custom dataset comprising domain-specific and unstructured documents. Results from automated and manual evaluations revealed that CA-RAG with post-processing consistently outperformed traditional RAG. These findings highlight the critical role of post-processing techniques and similarity measures in improving the accuracy and relevance of generated answers. CA-RAG demonstrates strong potential as a reliable and versatile solution for Retrieval Augmented Generation tasks across diverse datasets and domains.},

Calculated social engineers utilize simple communication to deceive and exploit their victims, all by capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of human nature: trust and fear. When successful, this inconspicuous technique can lead to millions of dollars in losses. Social engineering is not a one-dimensional technique; criminals often leverage a combination of strategies to craft a robust yet subtle attack. In addition, offenders are continually evolving their methods in efforts to surpass preventive measures. A common utility to defend against social engineering attacks is detection-based software. Security awareness, however, is a valuable approach that is often eclipsed by automated tech solutions. Awareness establishes a strong first line of defense against these ever-changing attacks. This study utilizes four data-supplemented large language models to generate custom social engineering scenarios with the goal of supporting strong example-driven security awareness programs. The performances of BERT, T5, GPT-3.5, and Llama 3.1 are comparatively analyzed, with Llama 3.1 producing the highest quality scenarios based on multiple metrics, including LLM-as-a-judge.},

While research has identified numerous benefits and issues, it remains unclear how ASD’s core characteristics contribute to the different outcomes. Additionally, little attention has been paid to the project context factors that shape these outcomes. Building on the ASD core concepts framework by Baham and Hirschheim (2022) and 12 contextual factors, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 126 studies to examine relationships between ASD core concepts, contextual characteristics, and the different outcomes (benefits and issues) of ASD. The implementation of core concepts like communication represents cornerstones for desirable benefits, while an inadequate realization of core concepts such as customer involvement can imply various issues. In addition, balancing their execution seems essential, as the highly-paced iterative nature of development and frequent inspections can imply negative consequences, besides their intended beneficial outcomes. Furthermore, we show that certain context factors, including high staff turnover, legacy systems, and volatile requirements can be problematic for ASD projects. Based on these insights, we develop a reconceptualized version of an agile sweet spot to determine an ideal setting for ASD projects. For academia, our work strengthens the theoretical core framework by identifying relationships among the core concepts and outcomes, while a research agenda guides future investigations into how ASD delivers its outcomes. Concerning practical implications, the findings can enable practitioners to improve the application of ASD by highlighting aspects that require dedicated attention to avoid issues.},

  abstract     = {The graph coloring problem involves coloring the nodes of a graph using the minimum number of colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. This NP-hard problem has various real-world applications, including scheduling problems, map coloring, and resource allocation. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem, there is a lack of effective and robust algorithms that perform well across different types of graphs. In this study, we propose the Malatya Vertex Coloring Algorithm (MVCA), an efficient and robust solution for the graph coloring problem. The proposed algorithm calculates the Malatya Centrality (MC) value for each node by summing the ratios of the node’s degree to the degrees of its neighboring nodes. Starting from the node with the highest MC value, the graph is colored such that each node is assigned a color different from its neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive testing and analysis. First, experiments were conducted on benchmark graphs from the literature, varying in size and complexity based on the number of nodes and edges. Additionally, tests were performed on social network graphs (which model social connections and behaviors) as well as randomly generated graphs with different densities and sizes. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms well-known existing methods such as Welsh-Powell, Greedy Coloring, DSatur, and RLF in terms of efficiency, robustness, and success rate. Moreover, in some graph types, it yields better results than MSISCA, another efficient and robust algorithm. It is mathematically proven that the proposed algorithm provides a solution in polynomial time for any arbitrary graph and guarantees an optimal solution for specific graph classes. The analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the Malatya Vertex Coloring Algorithm delivers effective and robust solutions for the graph coloring problem across various graph types without any constraints or parameter dependencies.},

While model predictive control (MPC) design, which predicts the performance of systems, can improve the control performance, it is not a robust control approach. To enhance the robustness of control performance, minimize the impact of constraints and perturbations, stabilize the closed-loop system, and achieve better trajectory tracking, a holistic control methodology that synergistically combines MPC and SMC is proposed for systems with input/output constraints, incremental input constraints, external disturbances, and measurement noise. The combination of MPC and SMC effectively stabilizes systems, achieving minimal overshoot, rapid rise time, and reduced settling time. The impact of external disturbances is mitigated using a filter. The closed-loop system stability analysis is subsequently conducted. Real-time implementation on a flexible-link manipulator and electric vehicle battery dynamic systems, subject to external disturbances, noise, saturation, incremental input constraints, and output constraints, highlights the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a link availability prediction framework for sub-terahertz wireless local area networks (LANs). In the sub-terahertz band, to combat severe path loss between an access point (AP) and a station (STA), it is necessary to form a narrow beam. Exhaustive beam search due to a large number of candidate beams causes significant processing overhead in establishing wireless channels between an AP and a STA. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework to predict link availability that utilizes the propagation information of lower frequency bands. To incorporate realistic channel characteristics, we measured the propagation characteristics of signals in the millimeter wave and microwave bands using off-the-shelf wireless devices under various AP/STA positions and orientations. We analyzed the measured characteristics of each band by quantifying the fluctuation and separability of the features in both linear and nonlinear spaces. The analysis revealed complementary characteristics: channel state information (CSI) in the microwave band showed lower fluctuation and higher separability in linear space, while the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in the millimeter wave band showed greater robustness in linear space and better separability in nonlinear space. Motivated by this complementarity, we designed a probabilistic neural network (PNN)-based architecture that integrates neural encoders to predict the link availability of the sub-terahertz band. Numerical experiments using the measured data demonstrate high performance, and show robustness to fluctuations and adaptability to variations in AP/STA positions and orientations. This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed link prediction framework for sub-terahertz wireless LANs.},
