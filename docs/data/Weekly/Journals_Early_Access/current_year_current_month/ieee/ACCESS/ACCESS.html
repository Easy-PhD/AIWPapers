  abstract     = {Accurately estimating battery state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle applications (EVs) is crucial to ensure a safe and reliable vehicle operation. However, robust SOC estimation under all possible operating conditions is challenging due to varying load conditions, varying and non-linear battery impedance, sensor inaccuracies, among others. Meanwhile, battery management systems (BMS) are trending toward more compact designs to enhance reliability by reducing wiring and boosting energy density. Hence, minimizing the memory footprint of SOC estimation algorithms is a key challenge, as their design and tuning remain a time-consuming and costly process for the industry. This paper introduces an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) algorithm with a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. The first stage role is to find the equivalent circuit parameters’ optimal values in a non-SOC-dependent manner. The second GA optimizes the initial AEKF model tuning parameters. To mitigate the randomness of the GA, an algorithm is designed to automatically determine the optimum set of parameters with minimal user intervention. Finally, to avoid calibrating the AEKF to a Coulomb counter, the obtained parameters were tested locally and using an online tool to ensure the robustness of the estimator. The described algorithm achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7% to 2% across various positive and negative temperatures under several drive conditions. With this tool, the AEKF can be rapidly tuned with minimal user effort, providing fast and robust SOC estimation suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare. However, its adoption is hindered by the technical-proficiency gap, the disconnect between AI complexity and clinical interpretability. Although Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) techniques aim to address this gap, fragmented research limits the development of generalizable and practical guidance. In response, we introduce FIXAIH, a dynamic, evidence-based framework that consolidates fragmented research in XAI and IML into a coherent structure to guide implementation in healthcare. It is designed to enhance the transparency, accountability, and efficacy of AI systems -- characteristics essential to meet trust and legal requirements, e.g., in the EU AI Act. FIXAIH uses a machine learning-based methodology to holistically analyze literature to identify key parameters shaping the integration of XAI and IML in clinical contexts. We develop a BERT-based tool and examine 5,083 articles, identifying 13 key parameters across three macro-parameters: Research Methods, Health Disorders, and Disease Prevention. This categorization, refined through review of 200+ studies, clarifies applications, trends, and challenges in healthcare XAI. These parameters serve as design elements for developing and aligning AI systems. Drawing on them, FIXAIH supports diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and risk prediction through, e.g., feature relevance, bias detection, model refinement, data preparation, and expert-guided adjustments. FIXAIH embeds this methodology and adaptable guidelines at its core, evolving as new evidence becomes available, with the intention to expand through integration of social media, clinical insights, regulatory data, and other sources. This adaptive design supports continuous learning and practical implementation, promoting a trustworthy approach to medical innovation.},

To address limitations of existing methods in small-target detection (e.g., 0.08%-area isolating switches), imbalanced component distribution (<10 samples for rare components), and joint topology-text parsing, this work proposes an intelligent framework integrating enhanced YOLO11 with CAD parsing. Key contributions include: an adaptive sliding window mechanism for small-target recognition, hierarchical feature fusion with CBAM attention to distinguish geometrically similar elements, and a DXF spatial rule engine for connection extraction. Evaluations on real-world grid datasets achieve 93.6% mAP@50 (21.1-point improvement over baseline YOLO11), 86% rare-component recognition, 100% text extraction accuracy, 99.4% connection accuracy, and 5.2s/image processing (3.04× faster than conventional approaches). This framework enables comprehensive collaborative parsing of 28 component categories with topological relationships, providing effective technical support for power system digitalization.},

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance on user reviews for decision-making has elevated the role of online reviews on e-commerce platforms, yet the surge in generic, vague, or promotional content undermines their informativeness and credibility. While existing sentiment analysis and fake review detection methods classify reviews based on polarity or authenticity, they often overlook a critical dimension: how informative and actionable a review truly is. Reviews such as “Great place!” may indicate positive sentiment but lack specific, aspect-level insights needed by consumers or businesses. This deficiency creates a substantial gap in current review analysis systems, which struggle to differentiate between superficial and detailed feedback. Addressing this gap requires an approach capable of capturing both the presence and richness of aspect-specific content. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven approach for evaluating the informativeness of restaurant reviews by integrating linguistic analysis with Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. The KG is constructed using restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset to define aspect categories, extract aspect terms, and model their corresponding sentiment relations. The proposed approach systematically identifies and extracts aspect-sentiment pairs related to four critical aspects: food, service, price, and atmosphere, using dependency parsing and a curated lexicon. A custom metric, Aspect-Aware Length-Normalized Information Density (Aspect-Aware LNID), is introduced to quantify the richness and completeness of a review based on its semantic content and aspect coverage. Experimental evaluation on the SemEval 2014 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a 97.5% weighted-average F1-score in aspect category extraction and providing interpretable, scalable, and domain-specific insights. This hybrid approach offers a transparent alternative to opaque deep learning models, enabling fine-grained opinion mining and improved consumer trust in online review platforms.},

  abstract     = {The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on smart grid infrastructures have raised critical concerns over data integrity, operational resilience, and real-time response capabilities. This study introduces a unified cybersecurity framework for cyber-physical power systems that integrate high-performance anomaly detection with provably secure cryptographic protection. A comprehensive dataset, built upon the IEEE 24-bus test system, includes a diverse set of operational states and five classes of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealthy and replay-based intrusions. To accurately detect both common and sophisticated threats, we implement a suite of supervised learning models—RF, MLP, and Decision Trees—alongside an ensemble strategy termed MVCC, which achieves up to 99.90% accuracy in binary classification and 99.88% in multiclass settings. For defense at the data level, we deploy a two-tier encryption architecture combining AES-GCM (for confidentiality and authenticity) with RSA-OAEP (for secure key management), demonstrating strong resilience against standard attack models (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA) and achieving nearly uniform ciphertext entropy (7.99 bits/byte). The system’s real-time applicability is validated through the deployment of the RF classifier on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform, attaining sub-second inference latency. Further, unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-Means) and temporal (LSTM) models are incorporated for stealthy anomaly localization and early threat prediction. This work presents a scalable, interpretable, and cryptographically secure solution for protecting next-generation smart grids against evolving data integrity threats.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has gained significant attention in past few years. The rarity of anomalies, considerable data volatility, absence of anomaly labels, and need for real-time inference in modern applications makes it a challenging problem. A robust training mechanism is desired that can accurately detect anomalous points in dataset with significantly large sized normal data. Moreover, multivariate data recorded by multiple sensors significantly varies from normal values in case of any defect. It is crucial to detect which specific sensor’s data are abnormal for system analysis and correction. To address these issues, we present a self-supervised transformer for anomaly detection, STAD, which enables robust learning from unlabeled data by synthesizing pseudo-anomalies during training. The research contributions are manifold. Firstly, a synthetic anomaly injection method is developed for anomaly generation and self-supervised training on critical anomalous behaviors. Secondly, a multi-head context attention module is designed and embedded with Transformer architecture to map the local and global associations, effectively distinguishing rare anomalies. Lastly, we propose attentive class activation tokens mapping mechanism that facilitates anomaly attribution by tracing the influence of individual sensor inputs through the Transformer model, offering transparent and interpretable insights. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving superior F1 scores and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.},

  abstract     = {Using machine learning applied to multimodal physiological data allows the classification of cognitiveworkload (low, moderate, or high load) during task performance. However, current techniques, such as multisensor data fusion (e.g. electroencephalogram, heart rate, eye movements, and other physiological signals), suffer from excessive dimensionality, intersubject variability, imbalanced feature vectors, and poor data alignment between sensors. This paper contributes three crucial points to addressing these difficulties and improving the performance in the classification of cognitive workload. First, it presents a novel theoretical model that explains the performance benefits of multimodal sensor fusion. Second, it introduces a feature augmentation strategy based on novel initial centroids optimizer techniques using k-means clustering that are intended to improve feature robustness in high-dimensional multisensor data. Third, it creates a hybrid learning pipeline that combines supervised and unsupervised methods, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble stacking, to improve cross-task generalisability and classification accuracy. When evaluated across eight multimodal sensor datasets (one public and seven self-made), at first, feature importance analysis corroborated the contribution of the augmented features. Secondly, the applied technique consistently improves the binary and multiclass workload classifications. Statistical tests proved the significance of performance gains. Thus, the results show that the proposed methods are useful in improving the measurement of cognitive workload from multisensor data.},

  abstract     = {In smart grid (SG), smart meter (SM) is the key component, which collects real-time grid load data to support intelligent applications, such as load prediction, failure detection, and dynamic billing. Despite benefits, the SM readings of grid loads also potentially leak personal information, resulting in smart meter privacy problem. Rechargeable battery (RB) deployed at the user side can be utilized to shape grid loads, thereby enhancing privacy preservation and cost efficiency. The energy management design is formulated as a sequential decision optimization problem to tradeoff the privacy risk, which is measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between grid loads and target loads, and the energy cost, which depends on a time-of-use electricity energy price. A novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) is proposed to efficiently design the privacy-preserving and cost-efficient energy management policy. The effectiveness of the ADRL-aided energy management policy design is verified through experiments and the superiority of the proposed approach is shown by comparing with state-of-the-art privacy-preserving load shaping method.},

  abstract     = {Real-time simulation of large deformations in soft bodies has long faced a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. This paper presents a novel Local Linear Corotated Finite Element Method that addresses this challenge through a hybrid strategy combining direct and iterative solvers. Our method decomposes the simulation domain into element groups; the dynamics within each group are resolved using a pre-computed direct method, while inter-group interactions are handled by efficient iterative constraints. This domain decomposition enables significant pre-computation, replacing runtime equation solving with fast matrix-vector multiplications. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy, demonstrating higher fidelity than similarly fast methods. The method supports anisotropic materials and achieves low volume change (2.95% error) under nearly incompressible conditions. Furthermore, its group-based architecture exhibits high scalability on multi-core processors, reducing computation time to 19.6 ms for a 120,000-tetrahedron model using 64 threads. These characteristics make our method well-suited for demanding applications such as surgical simulation, haptic feedback systems, and real-time digital twins, where both accuracy and performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {The fastest growing and deadliest cancer, skin cancer, requires diagnostic solutions that are accurate, understandable, and therapeutically actionable. Our six-stage deep ensemble diagnostic framework, XAI-SkinCADx, employs hybrid feature extraction, deep learning ensembles, understandable AI, and clinical recommendation creation to meet this need. The 2367 dermoscopy images belonging to nine distinct classes of the ISIC skin cancer dataset are used to train the framework. Adding 5,023 new images makes the dataset richer and better balanced across the classes. A comprehensive performance evaluation is ensured by using the dataset with an 80:20 train-data/test-data split. It begins with hand-designed feature extraction using GLCM-based dimensionality reduction and visualization and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) visualization. Three convolutional neural networks are then employed to extract specific spatial features: DV-25 (DenseNet201 + VGG16), DE-25 (DenseNet201 + EfficientNetB5), and DM-25 (DenseNet201 + MobileNetV2). Temporal patterns are described with bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and finally classified with multiclass SVM. The accuracy is 95.63%, precision is 96.2%, recall is 95.7%, F1 score is 95.9%, and area under curve is 0.97. We interpret it using Grad-CAM++ and LIME. Compared to Grad-CAM++, LIME had better localization accuracy (IoU: 0.78, Dice: 0.87) while Grad-CAM++ had worse accuracy (IoU: 0.70, Dice: 0.81). The best performing classes with LIME interpretability, Vascular Lesion, Seborrhoeic Keratosis, and Dermatofibroma, respectively, with Dice scores of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 respectively. For providing patients with personalized suggestions independent of other information, a dermatology-focused LIME-based recommendation platform was designed. The timely dermatology consultation and decreased clinical burden are led by the classification by the system of the disorders as low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk. By integrating accuracy, clarity, and utility, XAI-SkinCADx creates a new benchmark for applying AI in the diagnosis of skin disease, enabling physicians to make well-informed and trusted decisions.},

The work is specifically applied to low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LTPEMFC) systems that employ short-circuit (SC) activation techniques to enhance catalytic activity during operation. The design addresses the energy supply discontinuity problem to the load during SC time intervals, allowing energy normally dissipated through an electronic switch to be supplied to the balance of plant (BOP), thereby minimizing energy losses and increasing system efficiency. A model-based design approach using numerical simulation tools was applied to validate the feasibility of the proposed system for a 1 kW fuel cell. Results show greater energy recovery at lower operating power (50 W), reaching 4.27% and 2.38% for theoretical and simulation validation, with the following supplier parameters: 9.00 V SC voltage, 100 ms SC pulse duration, and 10 s SC interval. Previous sensitivity studies reveal that the optimal parameter combination integrates 100 ms SC pulse duration, 0.5 s SC interval, that combined with 9.00 V SC voltage, yields 34% energy recovery at 50 W. ESR aging in energy storage supercapacitors affects SC effectiveness more than capacity degradation over 5000 h of LTPEMFC stack operation. The proposed method enables LTPEMFC operation expansion to lower power conditions, compensating for damage in idle and start-stop cycling modes.

However, the controllers employing four independent torque and brake, and active front steering actuators still need more investigation. In this paper, an integrated control structure is proposed to navigate the autonomous vehicle in trajectory tracking task at high speeds. A kinematic-based approach is introduced to estimate the longitudinal forces of each wheel. The steering angle is designed based on a robust sliding mode control, which is responsible for the convergence of the lateral errors to zero. The proof of stability for both longitudinal and lateral controllers in the integrated framework are provide based on the Lyapunov’s stability theorem. Finally, a co-simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim software to appraise the performance of the control system. The results show that the control method is able to perform the trajectory tracking in high-speed lane change. Additionally, the proposed control system performs better in terms of maximum amplitude of errors and root mean square of errors when compared to the results of other research. Furthermore, the proposed robust control framework shows promising results in the presence of external disturbance and parametric uncertainties.},

When it comes to evaluation, the accuracy of recommendations and ranked lists offers a narrow view of the performance, usability, customer satisfaction, and risks of an RS. Among several other desirable properties of an RS, fairness has rightfully gained a prominent place in the research community. Trade-offs have been documented between conflicting metrics, but no work has addressed these as a dynamic time-varying properties. By proposing a novel experimental framework that models accuracy and fairness as evolving, non-static properties of RS, we aim to provide a new way of examining RS properties and present fresh evidence on trade-offs. The significance of this topic lies in its implications for real-world deployment, where fairness across users and items, especially in multi-stakeholder contexts, changes over time and must be balanced with predictive accuracy. By re-framing fairness using stereotype-based control groups, we enable more nuanced and dynamic assessments. We apply this framework across multiple real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens+IMDb, Amazon), simulating user and item cold-start scenarios in a walk-forward evaluation setup. The results highlight the complex trade-offs between competing metrics and offer actionable insights for the design of fairer, more robust recommender systems.},

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, the ranges of head pose and gaze are believed to play significant roles in the final performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows that the model using only our synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data extended with a large label range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance on multiple target domains. The data are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/Gaze-NV-Rendering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, knowledge distillation-based approaches have demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. These methods typically compute pointwise feature discrepancies between teacher and student (T–S) to localize anomalies. However, this paradigm suffers from two issues that degrade performance: (1) some normal regions exhibit large feature differences between T-S networks (leading to false detections), while (2) certain anomalous regions produce small differences (causing missed detections). To address this, we propose a Dual-Teacher Guided Denoising (DTGD) distillation framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a noise-removal task, where anomalies are treated as noise. Specifically, the DTGD framework includes a normal teacher, an anomaly teacher, and a denoising encoder-decoder student. The normal teacher encodes pristine normal data, and the anomaly teacher captures potential anomaly features from synthetic anomalies, guiding the student network to retain normal features and expel noise. After each encoder block of the student, our teacher-guided noise removal (TNR) module injects knowledge from the anomaly teacher, explicitly teaching the student which features to preserve. Furthermore, consistency loss and dissimilarity loss functions enforce consistency with the normal teacher in both encoder/decoder outputs and increase dissimilarity of anomaly-related features from the anomaly teacher via pixel-wise supervision. Experiments on anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that DTGD achieves advanced localization accuracy and produces sharper anomaly maps, reducing both false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal cancer (EC) remains the disease that has the highest incidence and highest mortality rate in global cancer statistics, emphasising the imperative to enhance diagnostic precision and reliability through the use of advancing technologies. While AI-enhanced systems can improve the early detection of EC considerably, the prevalence of artefacts (1 in 4 frames) during endoscopy procedures compromises the developed systems significantly, leading to unreliable medical decision making. Vision transformer (ViT) networks, initially designed for natural language processing tasks, have demonstrated outstanding performance in handling medical images by presenting distinctive features advantageous for image processing. The application of ViT for detecting and classifying artefacts in endoscopic images, particularly in classifying colour misalignment artefacts is still subject to continual refinement and enhancement. This work aims to investigate the implementation of ViT for classification of colour misalignment artefacts in esophagus endoscopy images. Moreover, even though ViT has been a major breakthrough, its acceptance for real world applications is often jeopardised due to the lack of interpretability of how the classification results have been reached. Consequently, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been explored to understand the criteria used to achieve the outcome. Several variants of the ViT and Data Efficient image Transformer (DeiT) networks have been fine-tuned and applied to our dataset in order to improve and evaluate their performance in colour misalignment classification in esophagus endoscopic images. Furthermore, XAI methods have been implemented to provide the criteria used by the network in reaching the classification results. Our fine-tuned ViT model, achieves an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 93.48%, recall of 93.46% and F1 score of 93.46% surpassing InceptionResNetV2, a state-of-the-art model based on CNN, with an accuracy of 89.10%, precision of 89.10%, recall of 89.10% and F1 score of 88.23%. Additionally, the GradCAM XAI technique has been found to highlight the deterministic features used by the ViT model better than other XAI methods applied in this work. ViT achieves remarkable performance in classification of colour misalignment artefact outperforming CNNs, attributed to ViT’s enhanced ability to capture pixel relationships through self-attention weights. In addition, the intrinsic self-attention technique provides novel insights into the model’s decision-making mechanism.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel approach, Channel Selection Dropout (CSD), designed to regularize deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Unlike standard Dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons in fully connected layers, CSD works on the image channels within the sequence of convolutional layers. Specifically, CSD is composed of three modules, i.e., Channel Process Module, Channel Drop Module, and Scale Module. CSD primarily emphasizes channels to identify significant channels based on activation values. It preserves channels that possess values above a user-defined threshold α. Channels that are less significant are set to a value of zero. CSD does not add any extra expenses during the CNN architecture training phase. It is used only during training and deployed only at a minimal computational cost. In the testing phase, the network retains its original state, resulting in no added expenses for inference. Moreover, CSD integration into current networks does not require re-pretraining on ImageNet. This makes it fit seamlessly with other datasets. Finally, the performance of CSD with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGGNet-16 is experimentally evaluated across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that setting α= 0.60 significantly enhances performance, with most results reaching over 95% accuracy on the benchmark datasets. However, the performance of α may vary, and it can be adjusted based on the specific dataset and architecture used. The comprehensive results clarify that CSD consistently enhances performance over the baselines. This method can be applied in future CNN applications to mitigate overfitting, particularly in image segmentation, Vision Transformers (ViT), and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes manifest through subtle and non-stationary clinical patterns, posing significant challenges for real-time prediction and monitoring. Conventional machine learning models often struggle to maintain performance under evolving data distributions due to concept drift. This study proposes an adaptive deep learning framework designed to handle concept drift through incremental learning in clinical data streams. The investigation centers on evaluating the effectiveness of various buffering strategies namely, adaptive buffering, FIFO buffering, and streaming without buffering combined with drift detection mechanisms for healthcare prediction. A balanced clinical dataset exhibiting evolving patterns was used to benchmark model performance. Deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM, GRU, LSTM, and Bayesian Neural Networks were incrementally trained, and their drift(Abrupt, Gradual and Recurring) responsiveness was assessed using three categories of detectors: (1) statistical test-based, (2) error-rate-based, and (3) uncertainty-based approaches leveraging Monte Carlo Dropout. Results indicated that adaptive buffering strategies consistently outperformed FIFO and no-buffer strategies, yielding higher accuracy, precision, and recall, especially under abrupt and large drift magnitudes. The hybrid drift detection method, combined with Bi-LSTM, demonstrated the best performance in maintaining retention and minimizing forgetting, even as the drift magnitude increased. Additionally, the drift magnitude study highlighted that larger drifts had a significant impact on model performance, with adaptive buffering and uncertainty-based drift detection proving to be more resilient to high drift intensities. This research underscores the importance of combining robust drift detection methods and adaptive buffering strategies to enhance the robustness of models dealing with concept drift in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology have highlighted critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities within In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs), particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. While numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) exist, significant gaps remain in addressing resource efficiency and the challenge of Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data in distributed vehicular environments. This study proposes Fed-CALiBER, a novel framework that synergistically combines a compact, pre-trained Lightweight BERT model with a Federated Learning (FL) architecture. By training collaboratively on distinct datasets assigned to Raspberry Pi edge clients, our approach preserves data privacy by keeping raw data localized and is explicitly designed to enhance generalization across Non-IID data distributions. With a reduced communication overhead by transmitting a small parameter footprint (approx. 13 MB) during federated updates, Fed-CALiBER minimizes network overhead during parameter aggregation. Our two-cycle experimental results demonstrate that the federated global model significantly outperforms standalone models in cross-dataset generalization—improving F1-scores on unseen datasets from as lowas 71.39% to over 96.59%—and successfully adapts to shifting data distributions. The framework is validated as a practical edge solution, achieving real-time inference (3–4 ms per sample) with low computational overhead on Raspberry Pi clients, representing a lightweight edge client.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a hybrid optimisation framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the construction of high-order Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. Such schemes underpin accurate and efficient time integration in computational science and engineering, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics to orbital mechanics and neural ODEs. Traditional optimisation of RK coefficients with interior-point solvers becomes increasingly infeasible as stage counts grow, due to the rapid increase in parameters and the highly nonconvex nature of the feasible region. Our approach addresses this by introducing dynamic algebraic heuristics that contract the search space through symbolic relations among coefficients. GA provides global exploration via mutation, while RL adaptively refines candidate heuristics based on reward signals, guiding optimisation towards stable regions while strictly enforcing order conditions. Empirical studies on third-order Extended-Stability Runge–Kutta (ESRK) schemes show reductions in Interior point optimiser (IPOPT) iteration counts of up to 36.7% for a-coefficients, with additional improvements of 32.5% and 24.5% for b- and c-coefficients. Statistical validation using t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of these improvements. Symbolic verification demonstrates that the discovered heuristics generalise across stage counts, maintaining full rank of the order-condition Jacobians and preserving third-order accuracy. Benchmark tests on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) systems, including the Brusselator, confirm both expected convergence and efficiency gains. These results establish GA–RL-guided optimisation as a scalable, robust methodology for designing advanced RK integrators, with potential to extend stability-optimised schemes to both classical simulations and modern machine learning contexts.},

This problem considers the assignment of CPU and bandwidth resources to servers and links, subject to network resource constraints. Given the dynamic nature of 5G core networks, where bandwidth and CPU processing demands fluctuate due to time-varying demand, user mobility, diverse QoS requirements, potential link failures, server outages, and the coexistence of multiple virtual networks (VNs), a dynamic resource assignment strategy is adopted in this work as opposed to static approaches in previous works. The majorization-minimization approach is used to handle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an approximation-based algorithm for core network resource assignment (ACNRA) with an affordable computational complexity is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing both network resource costs and server energy consumption. Statistical analysis of these results shows that our proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving average reductions of 5.92% and 10.28% in resource cost, and 5.43% and 10.10% in energy consumption.},

Effective risk assessment is therefore critical for improving workplace safety and guiding preventive actions. This study proposes an integrated risk assessment framework that combines the classical and fuzzy Fine-Kinney methods with the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PFAHP). The key contributions are: (i) identification of 26 hazards across four operational areas (office, storage, transportation, and pressure testing), (ii) incorporation of activity-specific weights using PFAHP, and (iii) comparative evaluation of classical vs. fuzzy Fine-Kinney scores. The results demonstrate that fuzzy-based evaluations significantly change hazard rankings (e.g., office fire hazard moved from 8th to 2nd), while PFAHP weighting shifts the relative importance of operational domains. These findings highlight the advantages of combining uncertainty modeling and activity-based weighting to achieve more context-aware risk prioritization. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable framework for occupational health and safety risk evaluation in high-risk industries.},

  abstract     = {Image edges are essential for understanding and processing the content of the acquired scene, but a clear edge detection is not always possible. Unfavorable environmental conditions, poor lighting, incorrect camera settings and/or vibrations may produce blurry or dark images with unclear content and details. Local spatial filters are integrated into many hardware and software as sharpening tools, but choosing the most adequate filter and its parameters is usually non trivial. This work proposes a new filter, whose kernel is computed by comparing over a pre-defined window the image Prewitt gradient with an image contrast measure inspired by Retinex theory. The experiments, carried out on public real-world images with different edge visibility, show that the proposed image-aware filter efficaciously increases the edge visibility with low computational cost and performs better than a standard Laplacian filter. As an usage example, the sharpening filter is here applied to medical images of retinal fundus: improving the clarity and detail of these images is essential for visualizing and analysing anatomical structures, identifying abnormalities, and assisting in diagnosis and treatments. Finally, a hardware architecture of the sharpening filter, partially integrating on-chip the gradient and contrast computation, is outlined. Such an integration could be beneficial for enhancing in real-time the quality of pictures captured by devices with limited power resources, with an average consumption of ∼ 28 μW and ∼ 30 kb of embedded memory in case of a color VGA image. The data obtained in filter validation experiments show a marked increase in the Prewitt’s gradient magnitudes in 100% of cases and in the edge thickness in a percentage ranging from 73.3% to 100% of cases, without visibly affecting the image naturalness.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to unprecedented volumes of unlabeled sensor data due to its constantly evolving nature. This phenomenon has created an acute need for learning models capable of intelligently use such data devoid of expensive manual labeling. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has recently arisen as an efficient paradigm to meet this challenge by directly deriving informative representations from unlabeled data. Nevertheless, the practical application of SSL models is hindered by their over-dependence on hyperparameter tuning, which remains a central challenge. In addressing this challenge, we introduce an MA-ASA (Memory-Augmented Adaptive Simulated Annealing) framework for hyperparameter tuning that has been optimized to this specificity. This framework is built on the concepts of temperature-adaptive mechanisms, short-term memory buffers to mitigate repetitive evaluations, and stagnation-initiated restarts, offering greater efficiency in dealing with hyperparameter space complexities. The proposed method employs a two-step framework consisting of denoising convolutional autoencoder (dCae) SSL pretraining on unlabeled data and logistic regression downstream classification on sparse labeled data. The approach was tested on UCI HAR, MHEALTH, and Environmental Sensor Telemetry datasets achieving classification accuracies of 96.00%, 97.33%, and 99.25%, respectively. The results showcase that the MA-ASA-based optimization strategy improves the performance and generalization of SSL models relative to other IoT domains, all while retaining computational efficiency and scalability.},

Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, the model is evaluated under two experimental scenarios: a conventional random split and a more rigorous zero-day split, where ransomware families in the test set are entirely excluded from training. In binary classification, the proposed system achieves 97.6% accuracy (F1-score: 0.98) in the random split and 95.9% accuracy (F1-score: 0.96) in the zero-day setup, consistently prioritizing high recall for ransomware detection. In multiclass classification, it attains 97.0% and 92.0% accuracy in the random and zero-day splits, respectively.

This study conducted a systematic review of NS-AI architectures published between 2013 and 2024, synthesizing the structural patterns and integration strategies in 319 peer-reviewed publications. From this corpus, 18 representative approaches were selected based on their methodological rigor, symbolic fidelity, and conceptual novelty. These approaches were subsequently classified into three architectural paradigms: Sequential, Multi-Integration, and Hybrid. Based on this classification, a five-stage symbolic integration framework is proposed, comprising (i) data preprocessing, (ii) neural–symbolic embedding, (iii) incorporation of domain knowledge, (iv) logical reasoning modules, and (v) symbolic postprocessing. The findings indicate that multistage symbolic integration, particularly when embedded within neural layers and reasoning components, improves system explainability, robustness, and semantic alignment. Comparative analysis further reveals a fundamental trade-off: architectures grounded in formal logic exhibit higher precision and verifiability, whereas those employing representational-symbolic languages yield greater interpretability and flexibility. The resulting generic architecture provides a modular design blueprint for future NS-AI systems, supporting scalable, transparent, and semantically grounded AI development.},

Key device parameters—capacitance, bandwidth, light-sensitive area, and excess noise—are characterized and compared. All devices were fabricated on the same wafer for direct performance comparison. The presented dot-cathode photodiodes achieve significantly reduced total and normalized (per area) capacitance without compromising bandwidth compared to planar APDs. Among them, electric field line crowding (EFLC) based APDs demonstrate superior performance with the highest responsivity (0.4AW−1 @642 nm), lowest capacitance per area (1.58 aF μm−2), and low excess noise (F = 1.8 @ M = 10) with a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. In contrast, the presented N+/P-well (NPPW) based APDs exhibit high excess noise making them unsuitable for data receiver applications. Notably, the only PIN device presented, uniquely operates in PIN mode with maximum bandwidth, while all other devices show reduced bandwidth unless they are operated in APD mode.},

The development of functions that target the performance improvement of such systems requires understanding of the dynamics of the received signal. However, measurements of the signal received power (SRP) reported to date are limited to the blockage and micromobility phenomena in isolation. In this study, by utilizing individual measurements of blockage and micromobility processes, we propose a procedure for generating synthetic time series of the received signal strength simultaneously capturing blockage, micromobility, and beam-tracking procedures. Our results reveal that out of all the considered applications, only the most dynamic ones, racing game and VR, are characterized by significant differences between on-demand and regular beam tracking with 4-6.5 bits/Hz/s spectral efficiency degradation in the case of on-demand beam tracking as compared to the regular one. For applications with high-speed micromobility (VR watching and race gaming), the minimal beam tracking interval is 80 ms, whereas for low-speed applications, a period of 320 ms and even sometimes 1000 ms is sufficient. Our results show that the availability of information regarding the type of application allows one to decrease the overhead required for beam tracking by up to 20-30 times. The traces produced can be further utilized for various tasks, including the development of statistical tests for discriminating blockage and micromobility events, designing blockage detection algorithms, and improving beam tracking procedures. We made the data produced available to the research community.},

Although B-mode ultrasound is accessible and safe, its reliability is limited by operator and scanner variability. We present the Deep Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DDANN), a deep learning system for multiclass steatosis classification (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe) from ultrasound that emphasizes cross-device generalizability. To mitigate distribution shifts across scanners (LOGIQ, iU22, EPIQ), DDANN combines a MobileNetV2 backbone with triplet loss, entropy-based domain adaptation, and preprocessing that includes speckle suppression, percentile normalization, and LOGIQ-specific harmonization. Trained on a biopsy-confirmed, multi-institutional cohort (primarily LOGIQ and iU22), the model was externally validated on an unseen EPIQ test set of 1,083 images from 47 patients, achieving 98.71% accuracy, 0.9872 macro F1-score, and 0.9998 AUC-ROC, outperforming baselines. In a separate radiologist–AI comparison on 224 biopsy-confirmed images not used for training or validation, the AI reached 91.96% accuracy, significantly exceeding radiologists’ 19.64%–31.70% (McNemar’s test, p < 0.001), with strong agreement to ground truth (κ = 0.893) versus radiologists’ poor-to-slight agreement (κ = 0.006–0.194). The AI maintained balanced class-wise F1-scores (0.90–0.94), while radiologists struggled, particularly with Mild and Moderate cases, and exhibited substantial inter-reader variability (κ = 0.068–0.648).

  abstract     = {The product delivery process is a set of steps to transport a product of an origin to a delivery point. Nowadays, there are different platforms or software based on classical algorithms for network optimization that help develop routes. Although these informatics systems provide vehicle routes, their prediction time has low accuracy compared to real times in the product distribution, since these systems do not consider the elements that affect route planning, i.e., despite providing vehicle routes, these software systems have low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to use artificial intelligence systems that consider the knowledge of the product delivery planning into route optimization models, thus increasing the time accuracy, but adding the challenge of having to interpret correctly the vehicle route ambiguities. Motivated by the latter, we propose a new fuzzy linear programming formulation to predict delivery times for products. Unlike previous studies, our methodology considers various parameters in the distribution process and offers an effective way to identify which parameters should be used. Our strategy combines the abstraction power of fuzzy logic and the result that provides a route optimization analysis, i.e., this work brings the best of the two worlds to address the difficult problem of shortest-route in product delivery. For that, our methodology has three steps. First, we introduce our formulation that incorporates a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) into linear programming to achieve accurate time predictions in product delivery. Second, we propose a fuzzy adjustment coefficient to consider the uncertain factors in product distribution and the expertise of the delivery staff. Finally, we develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize the distribution route and its time. On the other hand, we evaluate this methodology in the routes of a soft drink company using statistical analyses. Experimental results are feasible and promising. For example, in real-world scenarios, our approach reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 56% compared to methods that utilize artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the novel technology of waveform measurement units (WMUs), it is now possible to record time-synchronized waveforms (synchro-waveforms) at different power system locations. Leveraging these new opportunities, this paper introduces a method for accurate wideband measurement-based reconstruction of single- and three-phase frequency-dependent transmission line models for electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies. This method also accommodates hybrid (overhead-underground) systems and longitudinal parameter variations (nonuniformities). A 2-port line model is generated across a broad frequency spectrum using WMU terminal recordings and the numerical Laplace transform. For single-phase uniform lines, one transient recording set is sufficient for model reconstruction; this extends to ideally transposed three-phase lines. For single-phase nonuniform and three-phase uniform and nonuniform untransposed lines, a minimum norm least-squares method is applied to solve an overdetermined system from multiple recordings with linearly independent responses. Simulated measurements from ATP (Alternative Transient Program) are used for three test cases: a three-phase balanced uniform line, a single-phase hybrid system, and a three-phase unbalanced nonuniform line. The reconstructed model responses are compared with ATP simulations, confirming the technique’s accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the impact of practical signal conditions on reconstruction accuracy is analyzed in detail, including noise, resolution, and ratio and phase displacement errors from instrument transformers.},

  abstract     = {Embedding-based graph representation learning methods have shown strong performance on knowledge graphs (KGs), but most are designed for static settings and struggle to model temporal dynamics. To address this gap, we present TimeGate, a novel time-sensitive graph attention network tailored for temporal KG (TKG) representation learning. Unlike traditional approaches that discretize graphs into time-based snapshots, TimeGate directly models timestamps as edge-level attributes and jointly encodes entities, relations, temporal signals, and neighbors into unified initial representations. A temporal-relational self-attention mechanism further refines these embeddings by adaptively weighting neighbors based on contextual relevance. A key innovation of TimeGate lies in its multi-model and multi-task generality: it supports both temporal KG completion and time-aware entity alignment (EA) within a unified, end-to-end architecture, and can flexibly serve as a plug-in encoder to boost diverse existing TKG models—without relying on recurrent networks or snapshot partitioning. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (ICEWS, GDELT,Wikidata, and YAGO) demonstrate that TimeGate not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-aware EA tasks, but also consistently enhances the predictive accuracy of multiple backbone TKG completion models, highlighting TimeGate’s practical scalability, and broad applicability.},

  abstract     = {Private 5G (P5G) networks are driving large-scale industrial and enterprise internet of things (IoT) deployments. However, uncoordinated P5G deployments can lead to unintended signal leakage and inter-network interference between neighboring P5G systems. Constructing a radio environment map (REM) is a practical way to visualize and manage such interference. It typically relies on spatially regular measurements, but drive-test-based data are often sparse and spatially irregular. Furthermore, since signal strength inherently includes path loss, the spatial distribution becomes non-stationary and unsuitable for direct interpolation under sparse and spatially irregular sampling conditions. Removing the path loss component requires knowledge of the interference source location, but the source location is generally unknown in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement-based method to detect, localize, and map interference leakage. A novel localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the leakage source using only sparse and irregular measurements. The estimated source location enables decomposition of path loss and shadow fading, supporting accurate REM construction through spatial interpolation. Field measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling interference diagnosis and providing spatial evidence aligned with regulatory requirements for safe coexistence between neighboring P5G networks.},

By relying on COTS components, the need for fabricating custom and expensive semiconductor dies and limited-access transistor models for Class-F operations is eliminated. A hybrid design methodology, combining NLE-based optimal harmonic terminations with optimum load-pull-based fundamental source and load matching, is proposed to overcome their individual limitations. The proposed approach achieves optimum RF power and 3% higher Power- Added Efficiency (PAE) in S-band (81% vs 78%), 4.5% higher PAE in C-band (78% vs 72.5%) & more than 5% higher PAE in Ku-band (64% vs 57%), compared to prior COTS and MMIC-based works. A continuous-wave (CW) Class-F PA at 2 GHz is developed first as a baseline, and the design methodology is then extended to 5.5 GHz and 11.2 GHz (where transistor parasitics necessitate an inverse-Class-F topology). Dielectric constant variations beyond 10 GHz are analyzed, and a novel Class-F-1 harmonic control network (HCN) is introduced to achieve a first-pass design at 11.2 GHz. The fabricated prototypes include a 10 W Class-F HPA at 2 GHz, a 10 W inverse-Class-F HPA at 5.5 GHz and a miniaturized 25 W Class-F-1 HPA at 11.2 GHz. Performance measurements of these HPAs confirm superior efficiency, optimum RF output power and efficient thermal management (using low-cost copper-coin ring). The proposed CW GaN-based amplifiers (with linearizers) offer a compact, efficient and reliable alternative to bulky and power-hungry traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), making them highly suitable for satellite transponders and ground-based systems.},

The algorithm first applies spectral clustering to the PS from historical moments to automatically identify multiple subclasses of the PS. When environmental changes occur, the algorithm uses historical information to predict the centroids and shapes of each subclass, thereby constructing a new initial population. Experimental results on 14 standard dynamic test problems indicate that the proposed SCP-DMOEA outperforms four typical algorithms—PPS, MDP, KTM, and RNN—in handling various change characteristics in most test functions. These characteristics include translation or rotation changes of the PS, correlations between decision variables, and time-varying mixed Pareto optimal fronts (PFs), including variations in convexity and concavity. In particular, SCP-DMOEA also shows superior performance when handling optimization problems with more complex PF changes, such as the position of the PF continuously changes over time, the objective vector oscillates among several modes, and the PFs are discontinuous.},

To determine optimal segment boundaries, the system incorporates an Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM) that automatically analyzes sensor characteristics and selects boundary configurations that minimize global calibration error. At the algorithmic level, the proposed method integrates a Simplified Progressive Polynomial Calibration (SPPC) technique, which addresses the exponential growth in polynomial order observed in conventional Progressive Polynomial Calibration (PPC) methods as the number of calibration points increases. SPPC mitigates this complexity through a linear-order growth strategy while preserving high calibration accuracy within each segment. The system is implemented on a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with a dedicated Sensor Calibration Module (SCM) optimized for 8-bit signed fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed approach was validated through MATLAB simulations and RTL-level hardware implementation. Experimental results demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in execution time compared to conventional PPC and a 2.35% improvement in calibration accuracy through segmented calibration. Notably, the ASM-based segmentation achieved up to a 5.87% reduction in calibration error compared to non-segmented methods, even under varying input conditions, effectively reducing the need for manual tuning. These results confirm that the proposed architecture provides a high-performance, hardware-efficient, and adaptive solution for real-time calibration of sensors affected by nonlinearities and cross-sensitivity, making it well-suited for a wide range of embedded sensing applications.},

However, large-scale integration of these variable energy sources poses several challenges to network operators. Traditional planning models also do not lead to economic expansion plans at high integration of renewable energy due to renewable energy curtailments. Researchers have incorporated several techniques, such as dynamic line rating and demand side management, into network expansion planning for effective utilization of RES, but these techniques are not effective at high penetration of renewable energy. There is growing interest in energy storage system (ESS) due to its ability to deal with intermittency issues of RES by storing excess energy when available and delivering back during peak hours. This paper introduces a coordinated generation, transmission, and storage expansion planning model, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem. The model is used to study the economic impact of co-optimizing investments in these three asset classes subject to RPS targets up to 75%. We also analyze ESS impact on CO2 emissions from thermal sources and overall network performance. The model is implemented on a modified IEEE 24-bus system and numerical results show that up to 16.2% savings could be achieved in total cost at 75% RPS by utilizing the existing network more optimally compared to the case when no ESS investments are considered. Moreover, the renewable curtailments are significantly reduced at high RPS by integrating ESS and network utilization is also increased.},

First, prior to encoding, the input image is enhanced using SAM to incorporate boundary prior maps generated by SAM, thereby mitigating boundary ambiguity. Subsequently, a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder is integrated into the encoding network to facilitate information propagation. This module captures high-resolution spatial details while effectively leveraging global contextual relationships. During the decoding phase, multi-scale feature fusion is performed to ensure comprehensive utilization of features across varying scales, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy. Experiments on the LoveDA and Potsdam datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values of 53.52% (LoveDA), 79.45% (Potsdam) and 75.12%(Vaihingen), significantly outperforming existing methods.

  abstract     = {Sustainability in supply chains, particularly through effective trade-in programs, has become increasingly critical in addressing modern environmental and management challenges posed by short-life-cycle electronic products. Trade-in programs play a pivotal role in enabling sustainable closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) by promoting product returns and recycling, yet they encounter significant complexities. To address these challenges, this study introduces and empirically validates a novel hybrid decision-making framework combining Cloud Model Theory (CMT), DEMATEL, and MARCOS methods. Initially, expert linguistic assessments are systematically transformed into quantitative cloud parameters, capturing inherent uncertainties and intricate factor interdependencies. The CMT-DEMATEL analysis highlights economic and incentive-driven factors, notably pricing strategies and subsidies, as critical causal influence factors. Subsequently, MARCOS analysis identifies quality considerations, return rates, and real-time inventory systems as top priorities due to their comprehensive impact on sustainability, resilience, and digitalization. The sensitivity analysis then shows that the resilience weight is the most visible leverage: the importance of the inventory system rises or falls in direct proportion to its emphasis. The alignment between these analytical findings and practical industry scenarios underscores the framework's relevance and utility. This integrated approach provides managers with a robust, actionable guide for optimizing trade-in program performance, effectively bridging key methodological gaps in existing trade-in and CLSC literature.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) plays a prominent role in controlling modern power converters and electric drives. However, selecting weighting factors (WFs) remains challenging, particularly when considering additional control objectives (ACOs). To address this challenge, this paper proposes a straightforward, cost-effective, and flexible decision-making (DM) method for multi-objective FCS-MPC strategies. The proposed hierarchical structure DM method utilises the Euclidean norm to individually evaluate the main and additional control performances. Because it allows for the expansion of the number of hierarchical stages and does not require a sorting algorithm, it stands out as a flexible and technically effective solution among existing DM techniques for the given problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it is applied to the model predictive torque control (MPTC) strategy to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The MPTC with the proposed DM method is tested under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional MPTC. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed DM technique to handle ACOs in conjunction with the main control objectives and system constraints, while also demonstrating increased flexibility, enhanced control performance, and reduced computational demand.},

Automated detection and segmentation of these road defects are essential for efficient maintenance planning and hazard mitigation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of transformer based segmentation models applied for the detection and segmentation of potholes and cracks on different road surfaces. We introduce a custom dataset specifically modeled for urban roads that can be used for low-middle income countries with poor infrastructure and low maintenance resources. It features diverse road images under varying lighting, weather, and road conditions. We compare the performance of various segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness on this dataset. Our experimental results reveal significant performance variations across model architectures: larger models (M12) achieved the highest precision of 0.621 for bounding boxes and 0.618 for masks, while smaller models (M1) demonstrated computational efficiency with precision scores of 0.491 and 0.428 respectively. The mAP@50 scores ranged from 0.225 to 0.314 across all models, with Family III variants showing mixed performance profiles. Computational benchmarking revealed inference speeds ranging from 25-35 FPS for large models to 85-120 FPS for lightweight variants on NVIDIA RTX A6000 hardware. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of different models, providing insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of road maintenance and safety.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, novel designs of circular planar antennas capable of generating conical beam (CB) radiation patterns for millimeter-wave (mmWave) drone and vehicle communications are presented. The proposed geometry of the antenna comprises a circular patch surrounded by 18 quarter-wavelength bent stubs/corrugations and underneath coaxial feed that support the TM01 mode and produce a narrow-band linearly polarized (LP) CB radiation pattern. To increase the antenna bandwidth by improving impedance matching, six radial line slots were strategically placed in the top-patch, each oriented at 60° with respect to each other and rotated by 30° along the axis alignment. This configuration significantly improved the antenna’s bandwidth and maintains the beam at constant angle. Through optimization of the physical dimensions of the design, LP-CB antenna achieved a peak gain of 9.2 dBi with less than 1.5 dB variation across the bandwidth between 24.2 to 30 GHz. Moreover, gain patterns are circularly symmetric with very low-ripple at different elevation angles. By using the same top layer, and introducing three rings of tilted slots (6, 12 and 12 slots in each ring) in the ground plane, a second antenna is designed which is circularly polarized (CP) with a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 27.5 to 30.8 GHz. Across the operating band, the beam points at the elevation angle of 24° ± 1° for both the antennas. The simulated and measured results demonstrate that both the proposed antennas can achieve a -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW) of more than 22.2% for the LP design, 10.5% in the CP design, and both exhibit stable and consistent radiation patterns with efficiency values of better than 80%. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements was achieved. A simple planar geometry with wide bandwidth, high gain, and good CB radiation performance makes the designs promising candidates for 5G mmWave communications.},

  abstract     = {Although deepfake detection methodologies have advanced considerably, they remain susceptible to evasion techniques, a critical vulnerability in forensic systems. Most detection approaches that rely on generator-specific artifacts or high-frequency fingerprints become susceptible to circumvention when these discriminative features are eliminated. As a means to expose such blind spots in state-of-the-art forensics, we introduce GenPure, a novel multi-stage purification framework that systematically removes both low- and high-level synthetic cues, enabling generated images to bypass diverse detectors under a strict black-box setting. In the GenPure detection evasion pipeline, a U-Net-based reconstruction module with multi-scale, spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels first attenuates synthetic artifacts while preserving perceptual fidelity. Next, a vision foundation model—intentionally unbiased toward authentic-synthetic classification—aligns the attenuated images with authentic image characteristics by minimizing distribution discrepancies in latent space. Finally, reference-guided statistical color recalibration restores natural tone and further masks residual forensic cues. The framework requires no detector knowledge or additional training and generalizes across generator types, resolutions, and content domains. Extensive experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art evasion performance across multiple unseen generative sources and detection systems without degrading visual quality. The results exposed persistent structural weaknesses in current forensic pipelines and underscore the need for semantically grounded, manipulation-invariant defenses.},

This paper proposes a method for measuring and evaluating the line loss of power quality in the transformer area. This method decouples line losses based on IEEE 1459 and uses graph theory to solve the power quality line losses power factor of branch. By establishing the solution function of the power factor of line loss in the transformer area, clarifying the constraint conditions, the power quality line loss is solved by using the line loss of supply volume, the power factor of line loss of each branch, and the fuzzy range of line parameters. The simulation of the actual transformer area model shows that this method can calculate the line loss when the line impedance and length are not clear.},

Our imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) system consists of three modules: face and landmark detection, time-series extraction, and pulse signal/pulse rate estimation. The pulse signal estimation module, which we call TURNIP (Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography), allows the system to faithfully reconstruct the underlying pulse signal waveform and uses it to measure pulse rate and pulse rate variability metrics, even in the presence of motion. When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such “self-occluded” regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information. Our algorithm provides reliable pulse rate estimates without the need for specialized sensors or contact with the skin, outperforming previous iPPG methods on both color (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) datasets.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety and depression are prevalent psychological disorders that can occur throughout life, with a notably higher prevalence among women during the perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the postpartum phase. The early detection and monitoring of these conditions are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Although healthcare analytics has progressed considerably, the extraction of actionable insights from large-scale patient data remains computationally intensive, especially under instant processing constraints. Furthermore, conventional healthcare infrastructures frequently lack the scalability, computational efficiency, and architectural flexibility required to integrate machine learning models into clinical workflows effectively. To address these challenges, the proposed distributed computing framework employs Apache Kafka for instant data streaming, Apache Spark for efficient in-memory machine learning–based analytics, and Kubernetes for orchestrating scalable, fault-tolerant deployment. This architectural configuration facilitates continuous data ingestion, accelerates analytical processing, and ensures system resilience, thereby enabling the timely identification of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression during the perinatal period. Unlike schematic or batch-only prior work, we provide a production-ready, streaming-first clinical deployment and an empirical scaling analysis linking executors to end-to-end diagnostic latency and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in healthcare analytics.},

This paper introduces the Adverse Weather Affected Image (AWAI) dataset, consisting of 2,800 real-world weather-degraded images and their enhanced counterparts, annotated with subjective perceptual quality scores. We also propose a novel no-reference weather-aware image quality assessment (NRWIQA) algorithm designed for such images to enable quantitative evaluation of enhancement quality. Unlike existing methods that use generic features trained on natural images, our approach extracts deep features sensitive to weather-induced artifacts. A multiscale feature extraction strategy, fused via a cross-attention mechanism, is used to capture degradations across different scales. These features are further refined using a transformer to predict perceptual quality scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NRWIQA algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 17.61% improvement in SROCC, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing the quality of images affected by adverse weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques presents transformative opportunities for accurate energy forecasting and developing decarbonization strategies. However, existing forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex spatial-temporal interdependencies that drive CO₂ emissions such as geographic autocorrelation, delayed policy impacts, and regional socio-economic asymmetries. These limitations hinder predictive performance, particularly in emission-volatile and underrepresented regions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a GIS-Based Intelligent Energy Forecasting System built upon a novel Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Stacking Ensemble (STDSE-Net) framework. The system fuses heterogeneous base models—Random Forest, SVR-RBF, LightGBM and a custom GIS-augmented XGBoost-Geo—through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that dynamically adjusts model weights based on spatial error gradients. A meta-learner (XGBoost) integrates spatially weighted predictions using a hybrid mean-median voting strategy, improving robustness against outliers and data sparsity. Additionally, quantile regression is employed to estimate uncertainty bounds, and a temporal embedding module captures lagged emission trends via rolling policy-aware averages. Trained on the Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000–2020), STDSE-Net achieves a predictive accuracy of R² = 0.98, RMSE = 3.20 Mt, and MAE = 2.10 Mt, outperforming existing benchmarks by 22–48% in accuracy. Its GIS-informed dynamic weighting framework prioritises regionally optimal models, thereby reducing residual bias in heterogeneous contexts, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Spatial-temporal cross-validation confirms strong generalizability, and residual analysis demonstrates uniform error distribution across diverse geographic clusters. By bridging spatial heterogeneity with AI-driven adaptability, STDSE-Net offers a scalable and interpretable blueprint for next-generation emission forecasting. These advancements have direct implications for renewable energy planning, regional grid optimization, and geographically targeted climate policies. Future research will extend this framework by incorporating real-time satellite imagery, transformer-based temporal encoders, and policy document mining to support more granular, long-horizon predictions in dynamic policy environments.},

However, optimization-based approaches lack the flexibility to render multiple subjects with a single model, while acquiring multi-view data necessitates a calibrated multi-view setup. To overcome these limitations, monocular image-based methods have been introduced to enable the rendering of novel views and poses of human subjects in a feed-forward manner from a single image. Nonetheless, monocular images inherently provide limited information, presenting challenges when rendering occluded or invisible regions of the subject. To address this limitation, we propose InVisible-region Augmented Human rendering (IVAH), a method that generates and leverages additional appearance data to represent the unseen regions of the input observation image. Specifically, IVAH synthesizes a back image and a UV map of the human subject, extracting features that facilitate the rendering of the occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of generated appearance data significantly enhances the rendering of invisible regions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that IVAH surpasses current monocular image-based techniques in rendering performance.},

  abstract     = {Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), directly captured from cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, play a crucial role in guiding clinicians’ counseling on treatment-related toxicities. Accurate prediction and assessment of symptoms and health status linked to PROs are essential for improving clinical decision-making and planning post-treatment support as patients transition into survivorship. However, raw PRO data collected in clinical settings presents two inherent challenges, including data sparsity (due to incomplete item responses) and imbalanced toxicity distributions. These factors complicate predictive modeling. This study investigates machine learning techniques to address these challenges by predicting outcomes such as pain and sleep disturbances using PRO datasets from a cancer therapy center. We implement advanced classifiers (i.e., RF, XGBoost, GB, SVM, MLP-Bagging, and LR) for multi-class imbalance tasks across three cancers. To address minority underrepresentation, we apply oversampling while preserving class ratios. Experimental results demonstrate RF and XGBoost’s strong generalization, highlighting their utility in categorizing post-therapy severity levels for clinical decision support.},

HP-BERT achieves 94.72% accuracy, outperforming baseline applications of five transformer models to our specific task. The model incorporates multi-label sentiment analysis capabilities through additional fine-tuning on the "SenWave Dataset". Our analysis encompasses approximately 27.4 million tweets from six countries: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Statistical analysis reveals moderate correlations (r = 0.312-0.428) between COVID-19 case increases and Hinduphobic content volume, highlighting how pandemic-related stress may contribute to discriminatory discourse.

It can significantly affect the key properties of insulating materials used in such equipment. One of the most important insulating materials in high-voltage equipment is mineral transformer oils, which are essential for electrical insulation and thermal management. This study presents a comprehensive experimental investigation into the effects of gamma radiation on the electrical and molecular characteristics of transformer mineral oil. A series of controlled irradiation experiments were conducted using cobalt-60 as the gamma source, applying doses of gamma radiation ranging from 50 to 250 kGy. Various key parameters were used for evaluation, including breakdown voltage, moisture content, acidity, and density. In addition, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to assess structural changes in the oil’s molecular composition due to radiation exposure. All measurements were performed both before and after exposure to the controlled gamma doses to assess the extent of degradation. The FTIR spectra were analyzed in a semi-quantitative manner using the intensity ratio of the aliphatic C–H (~2920 cm-1) to carbonyl (~1730 cm-1) bands to reflect oxidative progression. The observed shifts in the electrical and chemical behavior of mineral oils were correlated with the extent of gamma dose exposure. The underlying mechanisms of gamma-induced degradation in transformer oil were discussed in detail to enhance understanding the key chemical and physical processes responsible for such degradation. To support correlation analysis, polynomial regression was applied to model the nonlinear relationship between gamma dose and breakdown voltage, which represents a key indicator of electrical performance.},

  abstract     = {Predictive maintenance is essential in modern manufacturing for improving the reliability and efficiency of machinery. A central challenge lies in accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as ball bearings, especially when real-world labeled data is scarce. This study addresses this challenge by combining physics-informed simulation with a regression-based transfer learning approach. A 5-degree-of-freedom simulation model was developed to replicate the lifecycle of ball bearings under varying operating conditions, generating synthetic run-to-failure vibration data. The synthetic signals were segmented and processed using statistical and time-frequency features, with dimensionality reduction performed via statistical relevance and multicollinearity filtering. Tree-based regression models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained on the synthetic data and optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. To bridge the domain gap, the Black Box Adversarial Reprogramming (BAR) algorithm was applied to adapt these models for real-world data without retraining. Performance was evaluated across twelve structured transfer tasks using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Results showed that BAR-enhanced models consistently outperformed their unadapted counterparts, with the Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving an RMSE of 10.25 and R2 of 0.87 on the best transfer task. A statistical evaluation over 100 iterations confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, while highlighting its stochastic nature. Overall, the integration of physics-based data generation with BAR-based transfer learning offers a scalable and model-independent solution for accurate RUL prediction under data-constrained conditions.},

Accurate estimation of POA is essential for designing efficient solar systems and predicting energy output. POA can be calculated using transposition models, that consider factors such as solar radiation components (direct and diffuse) and geometrical parameters like the tilt and azimuth angles. This study evaluates the performance of several widely used transposition models in the hot desert (BWh) climate of Doha, Qatar, using high-resolution (1-minute) irradiance data. A dataset spanning more than a year was analyzed with consideration of factors such as albedo, solar zenith angle, cloud cover, precipitation, and air quality. Several performance indicators including relative RMSE, relative MBE, and a risk index, were utilized. Among the tested models, Perez and Perez-Driesse provided the closest agreement with POA irradiance at two south-facing tilt angles, showing stable performance across seasons, while Hay-Davies emerged as least risky model. The analysis also revealed greater sensitivity to albedo at higher tilt angle. Model accuracy declined during cloudy and rainy periods, but improved during clear, dust-prone months. These findings highlight Qatar’s favorable atmospheric conditions for accurate POA modeling, supporting applications such as PV tilt optimization and system sizing, while underscoring the need for refined model tuning to address performance limitations under cloudy conditions.},

DFAG adds auxiliary losses to the feature maps at each multi-scale level during training, which stabilizes deep feature learning and improves feature quality. All modules used for DFAG are only active during training and are removed for inference, resulting in no additional computational cost.We validate DFAG on various multi-scale encoder-decoder-based image restoration models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple tasks, including real image denoising, Gaussian denoising, motion deblurring, JPEG artifact reduction, and super-resolution. Our results highlight that DFAG is an effective strategy to boost restoration performance without any architectural modifications. The source code and pre-trained models will be released.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are primarily capable of withstanding prolonged periods in unstructured marine environments. These are subject to several uncertainties, including the effects of underwater currents or drift, topography, water pressure, and other factors. The inherent motion of the vehicle is influenced by buoyancy or mass error and other slowly varying hydrodynamic coefficients. Moreover, an AUV faces various types of undetected faults during its mission execution. The use of large-dimensional, rigorous onboard sensor data from real-time AUV operations, subject to the limited power capacity and the presence of other acoustic issues, makes it more challenging for the control community from both stability and positioning accuracy perspectives. Hence, an anti-disturbance stabilized control mechanism is intended to perform a variety of underwater tasks in various uncertain oceanic environments. A two-stage high-degree cubature information filter (TSHDCIF) is designed to effectively observe unmatched external disturbances, uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, and actuator faultiness. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme incorporated with the TSHDCIF observer is proposed in this work. Various realistic scenario-based result sets, including 1) effects on ocean currents, 2) variations in hydrodynamic parameters, and 3) loss of actuator effectiveness, are addressed in this study. The control solution is compared with the baseline NMPC scheme to examine its efficacy, including depth accuracy, control aggression, convergence analysis, and computation time per iteration. Based on the analysis, the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme outperforms the traditional NMPC scheme by 5.49% in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) and 1.73% in terms of mean square deviation (MSD). The stability of the closed-loop system is explored using the Lyapunov theorem. Thus, it is recommended to use the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme for systems such as AUV for better efficacy, as mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {To address the issues of low accuracy, high missed detection rates, and insufficient robustness in strip steel surface defect detection under complex industrial environments, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv8-based detection algorithm named YOLO-KD. Building upon the YOLOv8n baseline model, the algorithm improves model performance through three key modifications: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss function optimization. Specifically, for feature extraction, the original C2f module is replaced with a C2f_KAN structure to enhance feature representation capability, significantly improving the model’s ability to extract defect features. In feature fusion, the conventional UpSample operator is innovatively substituted with the Dynamic Upsampling Operator (DySample), enabling more refined multi-scale feature fusion and effectively enhancing the model’s detection performance for minute defects in complex backgrounds. Finally, regarding optimization objectives, the CIoU loss function is replaced with InnerPIoU to further improve detection accuracy for defect locations on strip steel surfaces. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate that the YOLO-KD algorithm outperforms the baseline model significantly, with the recall rate reaching 75.2% (an increase of 4.3 percentage points), mAP reaching 77.5% (a rise of 2.1 percentage points), and the F1 score rising to 75% (an improvement of 2.25 percentage points). Additionally, the FPS of the YOLO-KD algorithm proposed in this paper reaches 121.7. Compared with the industrial production line requirement of 30-100 FPS, it demonstrates significant performance advantages, meets the real-time requirements for strip steel surface defect detection, and highlights its important engineering application value.},

Employing the non-parallel distributed compensation approach along with Finsler’s lemma, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize an upper bound on train performance and stabilize the system. The corresponding sufficient conditions are deduced in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Pruning redundant parameters is a common remedy, yet fine-grained pruning at the intra-layer level remains difficult due to the large combinatorial search space and the risk of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Fine-Grained Pruning (AFP), an adaptive pruning method operating at intra-layer granularity under a user-defined performance constraint. AFP estimates the importance of prunable components by accumulating gradients during fine-tuning and then performs a binary search over the importance-ranked substructure space in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify the smallest submodel that satisfies the constraint. AFP avoids post-pruning gradient recalibration and efficiently identifies the smallest submodel via binary search, without traversing the full substructure space. Experiments show that AFP adaptively achieves up to 66.56% and 45.84% parameter reductions on the standard Audio Spectrogram Transformer for ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K, respectively, within a 2% drop in accuracy, outperforming popular baselines of static pruning or layer-level pruning in both pruning effectiveness and search efficiency.},

However, wind turbines are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, especially those targeting control protocols and cyber-physical subsystems. In response, resilient control has emerged as a promising approach to enhance system security. Nevertheless, implementing such strategies in wind turbines poses challenges, particularly in maintaining finite-time stability and ensuring consistent power output. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel control framework capable of detecting and mitigating anomalies, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation of wind turbines. Specifically, a resilient pitch angle control method is developed using a combination of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and an adaptive sliding mode controller. The main objective is to regulate the pitch angle to maintain the rated output power while countering cyber threats. Stability is rigorously analyzed through Lyapunov theory, ensuring finite-time convergence of the tracking error. Numerical simulations based on practical wind turbine data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control structure in compensating for both false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {In response to the current problem of relying on manual field observation for detecting and measuring dangerous rock cracks, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv10s model for rock crack recognition and the Edge-based Minimum Width (EMW) for width measurement. The model was trained using a self-made dataset designed explicitly for rock crack detection. We integrated the improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) to form C2fGBA, maintaining the performance while reducing the cost. Meanwhile, Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC) is used to dynamically adjust the receptive field and enhance the perception at different scales. To address the issue of unbalanced sample quality in the dataset, we introduce Wise Intersection over Union (WIoU), which ensures high-quality samples contribute more during training and significantly improve the convergence speed. Additionally, we propose a one-stage width measurement algorithm that simplifies the process and enhances stability compared to traditional skeletonization-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our improved model achieves a mAP@0.5 of 78.5%, with a 3% increase comparing to the original model, and decreases of parameters and FLOPs by 2.9% and 8.2%, respectively. Other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and SSD, achieved mAP@0.5 scores of 64.1% and 63.6%, respectively. The EMW shows stronger robustness to round-shape noise, with an average relative error of 13.4%, compared to 28.4% and 27.2% by two skeletonization-based methods. This paper provides a comprehensive solution for dangerous rock crack detection and width measurement using machine vision, offering valuable technical references for related detection and survey tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cathepsins are lysosomal proteases which are crucial for protein breakdown, bone remodelling and antigen processing and whose dysregulation leads to diseases like cancer, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disorders, making them an important drug target. This study introduces a 1D Convolutional Neural Network-based classification model to enhance screening for potential cathepsin inhibitors, leading to more efficient selection of potential targets for experimental validation. The dataset was gathered from BindingDB and ChEMBL with the target Cathepsin B, S, D and K and the respective half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for their inhibitors, which were categorized into four classes—potent, active, intermediate, and inactive—based on the ranges of IC50 values. The inhibitor ligands were collected in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation and were converted to molecular descriptors using the RDKit library. Due to the large number of features, feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), variance thresholding, and correlation analysis were employed to refine and reduce the initial molecular descriptor set. Data augmentation techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were applied to address the issue of class imbalance. The proposed model achieved high classification accuracies, with Cathepsin B at 97.67%±0.54%, Cathepsin S at 90.69%±0.57%, Cathepsin D at 97.27%±0.23%, and Cathepsin K at 92.03%±1.07%, highlighting the effectiveness of feature selection and deep learning in ligand classification. This approach enhances the identification of potential drug targets for in vitro and in vivo testing, making the process more cost-effective and time-efficient.},

Existing approaches are limited to static texture-based rendering or linear sketch interpretations using symmetric kernels, which restrict their ability to capture physically plausible wrinkle behavior and user control. To address this, our method transforms freehand sketch inputs into spatially diffused wrinkle shapes using a kernel-based framework. The system incorporates asymmetric kernels and mobile device sensors (pressure and tilt) to more accurately reflect user intent and local variation in wrinkle structure. In addition, we introduce an automatic skin texture shading mechanism that simulates shadow effects around wrinkles and an algorithm that generates fine wrinkles based on user-defined parameters such as age. The interface is implemented via real-time UDP communication with a smartphone, enabling immediate visual feedback and an interactive authoring experience. Experimental results on various facial regions and materials demonstrate that our method produces visually rich and anatomically coherent wrinkles. Quantitative evaluation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) shows that our approach outperforms traditional symmetric kernel-based methods. The proposed system has strong potential for application in digital human creation, forensic sketching, and virtual content design.},

This paper presents the radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in a passive optical network (PON). The developed method aims to obtain different parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme as part of a 6G network. In this context, the RF signal is created with configurable universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), and the modulation scheme is modified to study the link’s behavior and to increase the system transmission speed. The first part of the analysis combines RF and optical systems in a co-simulation between MATLAB and OptSim. Meanwhile, the second part reports a real-world implementation of the front-haul link. The objective is to compare the simulation with the real-world results of the designed solution. For this purpose, we find the optimal configuration regarding the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM). In the real implementation, once the front-haul link is configured optimally, the RF signal is transmitted through a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This enables the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the analysis of a 6G sector in a controlled environment. We demonstrate that the implemented solution successfully achieves the required receiver in the PON and ensures minimal received power at the User Equipment (UE). The designed scheme provides an appropriate speed to transmit bursts of data with a very high transfer rate and ultra-low latency, which are essential features for new services in 6G.},

  abstract     = {We present a tunable terahertz metamaterial absorber featuring a fabrication-convenient structure that combines a vanadium dioxide (VO2) square patch and a graphene loop for multifunctional operation. This paper demonstrates an absorber that can selectively operate in narrow-band, dual-band, or broad-band modes. Combining graphene’s electrical tunability with VO2’s thermally induced phase transitions, this absorber realizes dynamically switchable and tunable absorption properties. When VO2 is in its metallic state with chemical potential of graphene, Ef = 0 eV, and relaxation time, τ = 0.1 ps, the structure achieves a broad-band absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz (>90% absorptance from 5.04 THz to 11.35 THz), with an average absorption of 97.24% and a relative absorption bandwidth of 77.12%. By adjusting graphene’s Ef to 1 eV and τ to 0.7 ps, the absorber transitions to a dual-band response, exhibiting peak absorptions of 91.13% at 2.62 THz and 95.48% at 10.81 THz. Conversely, when VO2 remains in insulating state and graphene’s Ef is tuned to 0.6 eV and τ to 0.2 ps, a narrow-band absorption peak of 98.18% emerges. Furthermore, we demonstrate the narrow-band configuration as an ultra-sensitive biosensor, where the resonance peak undergoes a significant redshift while maintaining high absorption efficiency with minimal changes in the surrounding medium’s refractive index. The design exhibits polarization insensitivity and wide-angle stability, validated through electric field analysis, impedance matching theory, and equivalent circuit modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported structure to integrate such a wide absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz with ultra-high biosensing sensitivity of 1929 GHz/RIU in a single fabrication-friendly configuration. These capabilities make the absorber highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, stealth technology, and biochemical sensing.},

Malicious actors may inject false data in communication channels to manipulate the tele-operator’s driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for the safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection merely is not enough and the detection of an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that security incidents across vehicle fleets be detected and logged. Thus, cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled with an attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on steering control commands is created from real vehicle data. The risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-informed context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a feature-enhanced Faster R-CNN algorithm to address the challenges of dense targets, varying object shapes, and complex backgrounds in remote sensing image detection. First, the single-stage model YOLOv8 serves as a baseline for comparative evaluation, revealing the inherent advantage of two-stage detectors in detection accuracy. In scenarios with high-density small objects, the original Faster R-CNN achieves significantly higher accuracy than YOLOv8, though YOLOv8 offers faster inference speed. Based on this observation, the proposed method introduces targeted enhancements to address three key limitations of the original Faster R-CNN: To enhance feature extraction capability, the method integrates Inverted Residual Blocks and Depthwise Separable Convolutions into the ResNet50 backbone. This design strengthens low-dimensional feature representation through a three-phase process of channel expansion, feature extraction, and channel compression. The ReLU6 activation function further improves model robustness; To address insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, the method develops a densely connected feature pyramid network (Dense-FPN). Cross-layer skip connections enable feature maps from different backbone stages to interact densely with each FPN level, facilitating comprehensive fusion of shallow spatial details and deep semantic information; To improve localization accuracy, the method employs a cascaded detection head with a progressive IoU threshold adjustment strategy, refining the bounding box regression stepwise. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed module individually and in combination. Extensive experiments on the DOTA dataset show that the improved algorithm achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.2%, representing a 5.3 percentage point increase over the original Faster R-CNN (72.9%). These results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively resolves critical issues, including feature degradation, semantic inadequacy, and localization bias in remote sensing object detection.},

Existing defenses–such as query monitoring, output perturbation, multi-model output variation, and post hoc verification–fall short in on-device applications where models must run under strict memory and computation budgets. These approaches typically incur high memory or latency overhead due to their reliance on auxiliary models or additional inference-time processing. To address these limitations, we propose CERBEROS, a defense framework designed to achieve security against model stealing with deployability in resource-constrained environments. At its core, CERBEROS introduces a novel neural architecture with multiple classification heads trained jointly for output diversification, while sharing a single feature extraction backbone to minimize unnecessary memory usage. At inference, CERBEROS reveals the prediction of a randomly selected head, thereby misleading adversaries while preserving test accuracy for legitimate users, without requiring separate models or costly output modification. In addition, we integrate structured pruning into training to compress the backbone while retaining the classification heads. This ensures that functional diversity across heads remains achievable even under tight resource constraints. Our experiments show that CERBEROS effectively mitigates model replication attacks while consistently maintaining task performance across widely used convolutional neural networks and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, it achieves significant reductions in memory consumption and inference latency compared to prior defenses, offering a practical and efficient solution for securing on-device AI models.},

This study investigated the effects of a PA’s positive emotional cues on female learners’ learning process experiences and outcomes compared to negative emotional cues. It also explored whether the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs moderated these effects. This study employed a 2 (positive and negative emotional cues) × 2 (high and low similarity) between-subjects experimental design, with 128 female undergraduates randomly assigned to one group. The results indicated that a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as having higher positive and lower negative emotions and being more likely to facilitate learning, more credible, and more engaging than a PA displaying negative cues. Female learners in the positive emotional cue condition showed higher positive emotions and motivation and lower negative emotions and extraneous cognitive load, with no significant differences in learning outcomes compared with those in the negative cue condition. Moreover, the results identified the boundary conditions of the moderating effect of the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs. The similarity in clothing and grooming styles generally did not moderate these effects. An exception emerged under high similarity, where a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as more human-like than one displaying negative emotional cues.},

The approach uses spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) in order to manage hypothetical data which is ambiguous and uncertain, and an adaptive weighting scheme is used to provide dynamic priority of the diagnostic indicators. The essential parameters, including signal attenuation, change in impedance, packet loss and cable ageing, are assessed and ranked systematically to determine the possible faults. The efficiency of the suggested method is proven with the help of theoretical data, which demonstrate a significant increase in detection rate, false alarm rate, and sensitivity to minor flaws in comparison with traditional diagnostic tools. The architecture is strong, scalable, and can be coupled with the already existing network management systems, hence, proactive maintenance and operational resiliency.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of road type classification using deep learning techniques applied to vibrational signals collected from inertial sensors. Two novel architectures, SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, are proposed to achieve high classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The SepRNet-1D architecture is a lightweight 1D-CNN composed of multiple residual blocks, built around a Separable Convolution-1D block, that decomposes the conventional convolution operation into two distinct stages: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. SepSERNet-1D extends this design by incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules to enhance feature recalibration and adaptability. Extensive experiments were conducted on a publicly available benchmark dataset, comparing the proposed architectures with state-of-the-art CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN-LSTM models, several 2D-CNN frameworks and Transformer-based architectures. The evaluations demonstrate the superior classification performance of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Computational experiments further highlight the lightweight design of the proposed models, achieving inference times below 4 ms in TensorFlow Lite format on a 13GB RAM desktop CPU. The results underscore the robustness, versatility, and computational efficiency of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, making them highly suitable for real-world road condition monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have become vital technology for electric vehicle (EV) charging, offering convenience, automation, and resilience in harsh environments. However, the safety and efficiency of these systems are threatened by the presence of foreign objects (FOs) such as metallic debris and biological entities near the power transfer zone. These intrusions can lead to electromagnetic interference, excessive heating, or even hazardous failures. This review comprehensively analyzes Foreign Object Detection (FOD) techniques used in inductive WPT systems, particularly for EV applications. The paper categorizes detection strategies into Metal Object Detection (MOD) and Living Object Detection (LOD). It further classifies them by sensing principles: electrical parameter monitoring, magnetic field sensing, thermal detection, capacitive methods, ultrasonic systems, vision based approaches, and hybrid techniques. A comparative performance evaluation is based on detection accuracy, cost, environmental robustness, and real-time suitability. Additionally, original conceptual figures are included to support understanding of the impact of misalignment and foreign object interference on WPT behavior.Moreover, a finite element modeling based analysis demonstrates the impact of various foreign materials, such as cast iron, steel, aluminum, and water, on coil parameters and WPT efficiency. The paper outlines current challenges, integration issues, and future research directions, including AI driven sensor fusion and the need for standardized validation platforms to enable safe, intelligent, and scalable EV WPT systems.},

  abstract     = {The next generation of automotives will incorporate significant electronic components and sensors to meet the needs for safety, communication, efficient operation and comfort. Automotive parts are largely made from fiberglass composites as they provide a high strength-to-weight ratio, light weight, strength and stiffness in comparison to metal structures. Fiberglass is made of glass fibers and a polymer resin, similar to printed circuit boards. Embedded (or hidden) electronics within such composites have the potential to reduce labor and material costs while also enabling new approaches to systems packaging. Among the many components needed in automotive, antennas are crucial for next-generation vehicle connectivity. Toward this goal, this paper presents a novel process for fabricating conductive fabric antennas and other radio frequency (RF) structures integrated into the fiberglass-based structures. Two different conductive fabrics, copper (total thickness: 60 μm) and stainless steel (total thickness: 50 μm), are used. These conductive fabrics are laminated to fiberglass substrates using a photocurable resin material. This resin is first characterized over a frequency range of 50 MHz - 6 GHz. As a proof of concept, a few RF structures are designed and demonstrated to evaluate electrical performance, including microstrip transmission lines, resonators, half-width microstrip leaky-wave folded antennas, monopole coplanar waveguide (CPW) folded antennas and microstrip patch antennas. Details of the design, fabrication and measurements are provided in this paper.},

Traditional econometric models often struggle with the high volatility and nonlinear patterns inherent in digital asset prices. Long short-term memory networks are effective at recognizing complex patterns, yet they lack interpretability. This study bridges this gap by integrating the error correction model with long short-term memory to improve prediction of Ethereum’s opening price. Using daily price data from January 2018 to June 2024, the model captures both long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term fluctuations, resulting in more accurate forecasts. The findings confirm a significant long-run equilibrium relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The integrated model outperforms standalone models, by achieving a mean absolute error of 46.76, a mean squared error of 5,544.05, and an R-squared of 88%. This study contributes to both econometric and deep learning literature, highlighting Bitcoin’s influence on Ethereum, and offering a practical framework for financial forecasting.

Machine perfusion is a novel organ preservation strategy and a promising technique that can maintain, restore, and regenerate organ functions. The purpose of this study was to develop an extracorporeal small intestinal serosa voltage measurement method to evaluate small intestinal functions during machine perfusion. The eight porcine small intestines were preserved under the following three conditions: simple cold storage (CS, n = 3); hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (MP) after CS (n = 3); and CS using grafts that had undergone warm ischemia (n = 2). After storage under each of these conditions, we performed reperfusion experiments at body temperature using diluted autologous blood and evaluated the status of the small intestine after transplantation. The microcomputer-recorded small intestinal serosa voltage was filtered using an IIR digital lowpass filter. The results reveal that low-frequency potential changes characteristic of the small intestinal serosa voltage were more pronounced in the group that underwent MP (0.19 ± 0.04 Hz; mean ± standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.28), similar to a previous in vivo study. The amplitude root-mean-square (RMS) of the lowpass filtered waveforms showed a negative correlation with glucose concentration change and a positive correlation with oxygen consumption. The small intestinal serosa voltage reflects the health of electrically active cell populations in the muscularis, indicating its usefulness as a method for evaluating small intestinal functions during machine perfusion.},

  abstract     = {In the face of evolving marine ecosystems challenged by global warming, pollution, and overexploitation, the imperative for sustainable management of marine biodiversity is more pressing than ever. Manual monitoring of oceanic species, though vital, proves arduous, time-consuming, and ecologically sensitive. To address this, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key player in species detection and classification. However, the complex task of detecting species in obscured underwater images poses a significant challenge, undermining the reliability of existing computer vision algorithms. This research paper proposes a framework for underwater fish species detection, addressing the limitations of current datasets and models. We present a pipeline integrating underwater image enhancement techniques consisting of Gamma Correction, CLAHE, RGHS and UCM, followed by YOLO-based object detection to improve the identification of underwater entities. The proposed framework demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detection and classification. A dataset is collected meticulously, featuring 20 marine species from the Indian Ocean, which is an improvement in comparison to existing datasets with poor image quality and inadequate annotations. The proposed framework employed not only predicts known species but also detects unknown species. This contribution strives to advance the field of marine biodiversity monitoring, offering a robust and efficient framework for automating fish species detection in challenging underwater environments. For our dataset, we have concluded that YOLOv9 produces the most accurate results among all YOLO models due to its integration of advanced techniques such as the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and Programmable Gradient Information (PGI). GELAN plays a critical role in enhancing YOLOv9’s learning capacity by efficiently aggregating information across layers, minimizing redundancy, and retaining critical features necessary for accurate object detection. Additionally, PGI optimizes the gradient flow during training, allowing YOLOv9 to better preserve and utilize essential information, even in deeper layers. Although, models like YOLOv12 offer lower inference time, YOLOv9 trained on raw dataset still outperforms YOLOv12 trained on enhanced dataset in overall detection accuracy. By addressing the challenge of information loss inherent in deep neural networks through these innovative mechanisms, YOLOv9 achieves exceptional precision and adaptability.},

Second, an adaptive impedance control method was introduced to accommodate varying ground stiffness (ranging from 2×10⁴ N/m to 2×10⁵ N/m), reducing foot penetration depth by 46.7% compared to conventional control. Finally, the STM32 microprocessor was selected as the core, and multiple sensors were installed on the robot to build the adaptive compliant system. These methods were validated on a custom heterogeneous terrain, including a rigid 50 mm obstacle and a soft 30 mm obstacle.

However, face embedding models rely on high-quality images, making them vulnerable to variations in quality, illumination, pose, and occlusion in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based aggregation method for face verification that leverages multiple embeddings to improve the robustness under adverse conditions. The model refines frame-level embeddings computed by a high-performance single-frame feature extractor using a Transformer encoder and is trained with an adaptive triplet loss that applies separate adaptive margins for positive and negative pairs. We train the embedding aggregation model with a two-phase strategy: pretraining with average pooling alignment and fine-tuning with adaptive triplet loss. We train the embedding aggregation model on the YouTube Faces dataset and evaluate it on unseen data from IMFDB, CASIA-WebFace, CCVID, IJB-B, and IJB-C, where it outperforms the baseline on most datasets, especially IMFDB, which has significant variations in pose, lighting, and scene context.

Traditional OCR models struggle with script variations, writing styles, and degraded documents. Advancements in technology are leading to new AI models with improved architecture for handling multiple languages and complex data formats. Despite this progress, a comprehensive evaluation of OCR advancements remains limited. Based on the established preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, this literature review presents an extensive assessment of OCR research to trace the evolution of AI models over the past decade. It explores the transition in AI models, application domains, data types, linguistic coverage, and challenges. Through a detailed analysis of 97 selected studies published during January 2015 - January 2025, key OCR models are identified, and their performance, strengths, and limitations are analyzed. The findings highlight how OCR technologies have evolved to address structured and unstructured text, scene text recognition, and multilingual processing. Unresolved challenges include limited resources for underrepresented languages, high variability in handwritten text, visual similarity among characters, and constraints in real-time OCR applications. To address these issues, several promising approaches are proposed. Key suggestions include self-supervised learning, multimodal AI, automated machine learning (AutoML), AI-assisted postprocessing, tiny machine learning (TinyML), and the creation of joint corpora for script matching. The future recommendations aim to enhance OCR accuracy and tackle the challenges identified for real-time industrial applications.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the attack’s potency, achieving evasion rates of up to 99.53% with an extremely low budget of 1-10 hard-label queries. Our method proves its versatility by successfully targeting models trained on both Boolean and Markov Chain-based features, and importantly, in challenging cross-dimensional scenarios where the attacker’s feature knowledge is limited. Furthermore, a case study on VirusTotal confirms its practical efficacy, reducing detection rates of modern malware by commercial engines by up to 49.7%.

Common parallelization methods include droop control, which avoids critical communication links but is sensitive to line and load parameters, and master–slave architectures, which offer better control capabilities but rely entirely on a single master unit. Additionally, conventional master–slave schemes do not support dynamic role reassignment without interrupting operation. This paper proposes a master–slave control strategy that enables autonomous role reassignment among inverter units in the event of master failure, without requiring system shutdown. The architecture achieves N+1 redundancy and provides all units with grid-forming capability. Role transitions are coordinated through a promotion–degradation mechanism over low-bandwidth communication buses such as CAN. The proposed approach ensures seamless role changes via local AC voltage reference generation, enhancing system robustness and continuity under fault conditions.},

  abstract     = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which provides the rationale behind machine learning decisions, is essential for deploying AI in high-risk domains. However, most XAI methods provide only single-point explanations without indicating their reliability and are often unstable, i.e., small changes in training data can lead to significantly different explanations. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a Bayesian-approximate inverse model explanation method, an extension of AIME that incorporates a Bayesian framework. By modeling the inverse operator of a black-box model probabilistically, Bayesian-AIME estimates feature importance as a posterior distribution. This enables the assignment of 95% credible intervals (CIs) to feature importance scores, facilitating quantitative assessment of explanation reliability. Using the posterior mean also improves explanation stability. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated via three experiments: (1) stability analysis via bootstrapping, (2) validation of CIs on synthetic data with known importance, and (3) case studies on Titanic survival prediction and breast cancer diagnosis. The results showed that Bayesian-AIME outperformed existing methods in terms of stability and conveyed meaningful uncertainty, thus enhancing model interpretability.

  abstract     = {We propose a GA-optimized self-attention LSTM (SAG-LSTM) for multi-asset price forecasting and evaluate it on daily series of crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin, augmented with trading volumes (01-Apr-2021 to 30-Dec-2024). The model marries LSTM sequence learning with a multi-head self-attention layer and a post-attention gating block; a genetic algorithm tunes key hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden size, epochs). Using a 30-day horizon and standard preprocessing with lagged features, we benchmark SAG-LSTM against SA-LSTM and vanilla LSTM on MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 , supplemented by error-trend and residual diagnostics, a forecast coherence score, and inter-asset dynamic/cross-correlation analyses. SAG-LSTM consistently dominates the baselines across assets: out-of-sample R2 rises to 0.90 for oil, 0.94 for gold, and 0.88 for Bitcoin, with visibly flatter error profiles and tighter, near-zero residuals. Inter-asset analyses show time-varying contemporaneous correlations but weak lead–lag effects, clarifying when co-movement is episodic rather than persistent. The largest gains occur in oil, reflecting more structured fundamentals; improvements for gold and Bitcoin are material but tempered by regime shifts and sentiment-driven jumps. Training time is higher due to GA search (≈2,121 s), but inference is fast (≈0.40 s), making the approach suitable for infrequent retraining with near-real-time scoring. Our findings highlight the value of hybrid, optimization-aware deep architectures for medium-horizon forecasting while underscoring the limits of price-volume inputs in sentiment-sensitive markets. These results offer actionable guidance for practitioners and a roadmap for future research and policy.},

First, a machine learning model predicts port authority allocation behavior based on historical data. These predictions capture the port authority’s scheduling behavior which reflects implicit operational patterns by predicting vessel waiting times. Second, these predicted behaviors are embedded into an optimization model through explicit constraints that ensure berth assignments closely align with berth authority tendencies. Using real operational data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against a conventional optimization approach that does not take port authority behavior into account. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the proposed model effectively incorporates port authority behavior by varying the port authority behavior rate parameter.},

Significant imbalances in these parameters can degrade battery performance and reduce reliability. Although active balancing strategies offer greater control flexibility compared to passive methods, they typically face challenges in implementing complex control algorithms, particularly for multi-objective balancing tasks. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced active BMS employing reinforcement learning (RL) to simultaneously minimize deviations in SOC and cell temperature. Specifically, a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based RL agent is trained within a simulation environment and subsequently deployed in a real-world experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can quickly and effectively balance both SOC and cell temperature while efficiently managing the auxiliary power source (APS). This study validates the feasibility of intelligent multi-objective battery state balancing with RL.},

However, their widespread use increases the likelihood of faults, particularly open-circuit faults, and performance degradation due to prolonged or harsh operating conditions. This study investigates the effectiveness of five supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in detecting three fault types in a three-phase controlled rectifier: open-circuit faults, wear-out faults, and their combination. The dataset was generated entirely using a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model of the rectifier, ensuring controlled fault injection for training and evaluation of the classifiers. Four key electrical features: output voltage, voltage ripple, voltage ratio, and impedance, were extracted and analyzed to assess their impact on fault detection performance. The study provides a detailed performance comparison of the classifiers based on classification accuracy and execution time. Results show that the KNN algorithm offers the best trade-off between precision and computational execution time having achieved a precision of 95.59% with an execution time of only 0.014 s while RF achieves the highest precision of 99.88% but with an execution time of 1.258 s.

  abstract     = {Flapping-wing robots have recently attracted significant interest due to their agility and potential energy efficiency compared to traditional aerial systems such as multirotor vehicles. Inspired by bird flight, these novel aerial robots generate thrust and a portion of their lift through wing flapping, while also maintaining lift passively even when the wings are not actively flapping. These robots can switch between the flapping and gliding modes, enabling energy-efficient navigation strategies. However, the design of optimal navigation trajectories that consider the effect of the wind remains unexplored. This paper presents a novel approach to flapping-wing aerial navigation that leverages wind conditions to reduce energy consumption during flight. A physics-based trajectory optimization framework that adjusts the control inputs (flapping frequency and elevator) is formulated based on a dynamic model of the flapping-wing robot, including wind effects. Through optimization-based trajectory planning, our proposed solution adjusts the robot’s flight to take advantage of favorable wind patterns, thereby reducing energy consumption. Our results demonstrate significant energy savings, validating the potential of wind-aware strategies to improve the endurance and efficiency of flapping-wing aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) has materialized as a pivotal technology in wireless communications, addressing spectrum scarcity by enabling dynamic spectrum access. A fundamental component of CR at base transceiver stations is Spectrum Sensing (SS), which detects available frequencies within the licensed spectrum of Primary Users (PUs) to minimize channel interference. This study introduces an advanced SS model that integrates two complementary techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Wavelet Denoising (WD). The proposed WD-based CNN model (WD-CNN) is designed to enhance detection accuracy under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. In the WD-CNN framework, an initial CNN model is employed as a feature extractor, leveraging spectrogram images of received signals to differentiate signal components from noise. The network is trained on diverse signal representations at low SNR to improve robustness. Unlike conventional CNN-based SS approaches, the proposed model further integrates WD with soft thresholding as a secondary denoising mechanism, refining the extracted features to accurately identify PU signals. Performance evaluation demonstrates that WD-CNN significantly outperforms both a CNN model (First CNN model) and transfer learning-based approaches, such as AlexNet. Specifically, at SNR levels of −10 dB and −20 dB, WD-CNN improves detection accuracy by 10.94% and 25.1%, respectively, compared to the First CNN Model. Furthermore, the proposed model surpasses AlexNet by 13.28% at −10 dB and 23.44% at −20 dB. Additionally, WD-CNN achieves a 30.06% accuracy improvement at −15 dB and a substantial 53.44% gain at −20 dB over conventional deep-learning-based SS techniques, while also exhibiting reduced computational complexity. Results demonstrate that the proposed WD-CNN model significantly enhances SS performance under challenging SNR conditions, providing a more robust and computationally efficient alternative to conventional CNN-based detection methods.},

By fusing data from heterogeneous sensors, the system enhances detection robustness while mitigating the privacy concerns associated with constant visual surveillance. When a risk is detected, it immediately alerts medical staff, enabling prompt intervention. The primary contributions of this work are the development of an integrated, multimodal architecture that improves upon single-sensor systems and the implementation of a privacy-conscious framework for continuous patient monitoring, thereby enhancing safety for both patients and healthcare providers.},

  abstract     = {In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The principle of the proposed method relies on leveraging LLMs to automatically assign relevant SDG labels to input texts, enabling scalable, consistent, and efficient monitoring of SDG-related content across different sources. By employing in-context learning and prompt engineering, the study investigates how smaller, more accessible models can achieve high performance with minimal labeled data. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that, on the SDG text classification task, smaller models (such as flan-t5-large) with prompt optimization can achieve macro F1-scores up to 0.75, closely matching the performance of much larger models like gpt-3.5, which attained a macro F1-score of 0.77. Few-shot learning further improved results for challenging classes, reducing the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These findings suggest that, with proper prompt and task adaptation, open-source LLMs can offer a competitive and more accessible alternative for SDG classification, paving the way for broader and cost-effective adoption of automated SDG monitoring tools.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of intelligent power grids into integrated cyber-physical systems has unveiled significant vulnerabilities within their digital measurement frameworks, with false data injection (FDI) attacks presenting substantial threats to grid stability by potentially inciting cascading failures via manipulated control interventions. Although the existing technique of the Variable Dummy Value Model with a non-linear functional form (NF-VDVM) enhances the detection of FDI, it continues to be susceptible to adaptive adversaries who capitalize on deterministic patterns. This study introduces a Dummy-Variable Model with randomized coefficients (RP-VDVM) that fundamentally fortifies security measures through the implementation of dynamic coefficient randomization, effectively eliminating predictable attack vectors. Rigorously assessed on the IEEE 14-bus and other bus systems using authentic PJM load profiles, RP-VDVM exhibits remarkable 95% detection accuracy under a 5% attack intensity (representing a 2.1 times enhancement compared to the NF-VDVM 45%) while maintaining a false negative rate 2% according to North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. An analysis of computational complexity validates the model’s theoretical scalability to more extensive systems, with anticipated execution durations of 480 milliseconds (ms) for 300-bus networks. The proposed model is also compared to other machine learning detectors in order to position it as a viable, high-performance resolution for AC power networks that surpasses both conventional state estimation methods and machine learning-based detection systems in security-critical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Power system survivability, defined as the ability of a system to maintain steady-state functionality under varying operational conditions, reflects its resilience against disturbances. While existing research primarily focuses on physical-layer disturbances, the increasing prevalence of grid-edge DERs, which are primarily used for integrating renewable energy, has significantly expanded the cyber attack surface. As a result, operational disruptions caused by cyber threats are posing significant challenges to system survivability and cannot be overlooked. To fill this gap, we redefine system survivability to incorporate the cyber layer’s status and propose a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to enhance power system survivability against potential cyber-physical threats. In this paper, we first analyze the operational guidelines of systems with a high penetration of DERs under various cyber network conditions and redefine survivability in this context. Next, we focus on the most common cyber threat, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and develop a corresponding attack model. This model allows for the creation of a kernel-based ambiguity set that captures attack uncertainties using historical data. Finally, we transform the proposed DRO model as a tractable optimization problem, with its solution providing an optimal cyber redundancy plan to enhance system survivability in DoS attack scenarios. Simulation results on the IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in improving system survivability. This model can also be expanded to include other types of common attacks and serve as a comprehensive planning tool to improve overall cyber physical survival of the system.},

However, light emitted from the projector can cause severe color distortions, degrading the performance of color-based object detection.In this study, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based image restoration model designed to correct such projection-induced distortions. The model incorporates a color condition vector derived from the projector’s illumination, attention and residual blocks in the generator, and a similarity map module in the discriminator, optimized with WGAN-GP and perceptual losses. By restoring distorted images to their original appearance, the proposed method improves detection accuracy without retraining existing object detection models.Experimental results on a 50,000-image projector–camera dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative restoration models—including Autoencoder, SRCNN, U-Net, ResNet50, and DnCNN—across all quantitative metrics (e.g., LPIPS 0.078, CIEDE2000 5.766, SSIM 0.903). Furthermore, object detection accuracy reached 97.2% for template matching and 99.2% for YOLO, nearly matching the performance on original images. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing object recognition under projection-based environments and indicate its potential for robust deployment in diverse AR and SAR applications.},

  abstract     = {Megaprojects are large-scale, complex, and one-off engineering endeavors that require significant investments from a public or private sector. Such projects generally cost more than a billion dollars, take many years to develop and construct, involve stakeholders both in the public and private sectors, and impact millions of people. Most of the extant megaproject research is concerned with understanding why the engineering management of megaprojects fails so frequently and which dimensions make them so difficult to manage, including size, uncertainty, complexity, urgency, and institutional structure [1]. Recently, the literature on mega-projects has advocated for a convergence of the engineering management and production system management literature. To that end, this paper proposes the use of Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT), where the latter, quite interestingly, finds its origins in the mass-customized production system literature. More specifically, HFGT was developed so that the physical and informatic parts of production system planning, operations, and decision-making are readily reconfigured to support production customization at scale. As the literature on megaprojects is rapidly evolving with a significant amount of divergence between authors, this report builds upon the recent and extensive megaproject literature review provided by Denicol et. al. [1]. The paper concludes that MBSE and HFGT provide a means for addressing many of the concluding recommendations provided by Denicol et. al. MBSE and HFGT not only align with current research on megaprojects but also push the boundaries of how the engineering management of megaprojects can gain a unified theoretical foundation.},

In this paper, we address the cooperative mission planning of multiple UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), where UAVs are tasked with visiting a predetermined set of waypoints, and UGVs act as mobile battery replenishment platforms. The objective is to determine a cooperative mission plan that minimizes the overall mission completion time while respecting UAV flight time constraints. To this end, the mission is decomposed into a set of flight-and-recharge segments, and a genetic algorithm is applied to solve the resulting optimization problem. The proposed approach is evaluated using real-world datasets from three different operational areas. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze parameter settings and validate the robustness of the method. Simulation results show that the algorithm adapts to variations in mission layout and can efficiently plan large-scale missions with thousands of waypoints, involving multiple UAVs and UGVs.},

  abstract     = {In modern smart manufacturing, real-time anomaly detection is critical, yet state of the art (SOTA) models like PatchCore are often too computationally demanding for practical deployment on resource -constrained edge devices. This creates a crucial gap between algorithmic potential and industrial application. To bridge this gap, we propose ViT-Core, a lightweight and efficient model for anomaly detection. Our primary innovation involves replacing the conventional CNN backbone with an efficient Swin Transformer, which reduces feature map dimensionality and, consequently, memory usage. To maintain high accuracy, we employ a Cut-Paste-based transfer learning stage, a self-supervised process that fine-tunes the model to the target data distribution without requiring complex training or additional labels. Evaluated on the comprehensive MVTec AD benchmark, ViT-Core demonstrates a drastic reduction in computational overhead, with memory usage decreased by 49.2% and inference time by 49.5% compared to the PatchCore baseline. This optimization is achieved with a statistically insignificant difference in image-level classification performance (0.9859 AUROC vs. 0.9865). Moreover, ViT-Core excels in anomaly localization, improving the pixel-level AUROC to 0.9817 from PatchCore's 0.9756. Consequently, ViT-Core presents an optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical and scalable solution that enables the widespread deployment of high-performance, real-time quality inspection systems directly on existing industrial hardware.},

  abstract     = {Microplastic (MP) pollution is a serious environmental and public health concern. However, the mechanisms governing MP distribution and transport in rural household environments remain poorly understood. This study presents the first integrated compartmental analysis of MP transfer between outdoor and indoor matrices, including soil, indoor air (inlet and outlet), and reused cooking oil in households located in Karunya Nagar (10.938523°N, 76.743782°E), a rural area in India. Samples were selected based on waste mismanagement profiles and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. High plastic loads detected in the soil samples consisted of polypropylene (PP, 38.21%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 32.85%), polyethylene (22.78%), and polystyrene (PS, 6.16%), likely originating from agricultural films, packaging, and burned household waste. Samples from the air inlet predominantly contained PP (41.72%) and PET (33.94%), suggesting resuspension from contaminated soil due to wind action. Substantial concentrations of PET (42.4%) and PS (25.4%) were detected in reused indoor cooking oil, representing increases of 29.1% and 14.2%, respectively, relative to the air inlet samples. This suggests sorption and thermal transfer during cooking processes in open containers. Increases of 9.4% PP and 0.27% PET in air outlet profiles provide evidence of re-aerosolization during heating and inefficient ventilation. Polymer aging and oxidative degradation were confirmed by spectral intensities at 1783.1 cm−1, 1161.15 cm−1, and 509.21 cm−1. These results reveal a continuous, cyclic pathway of MP entry, accumulation, and secondary emission within rural households, demonstrating an overlooked but critical exposure route that necessitates targeted waste management and health interventions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion and inefficiencies in transportation networks pose significant challenges to road safety, travel times, and environmental sustainability. Traditional traffic management systems, typically reliant on sparse sensor data and rigid models, often fail to provide accurate, reliable, and user-friendly insights. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Traffic State Estimator (PINN-TSE), framework that integrates the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model with advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By combining physics-informed modeling with data-driven learning, the framework ensures accurate and physically consistent predictions of traffic density and velocity. A multicomponent loss function balances data fidelity with physical constraints, while Large Language Models (LLMs) generate contextualized and interpretable traffic insights through a chat-based web interface. The system is designed to handle diverse user queries from precise spatio-temporal inputs to broad, general inquiries, making it highly adaptable for real-world deployment. Validated on real-world data from the US-101 highway, PINN-TSE demonstrated strong performance in capturing shockwave dynamics and transitions between traffic regimes. It achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.4 vehicles per mile (vpm) for density and 3.98 mph for velocity, representing improvements of 60% and 73%, respectively, over purely data-driven models. Furthermore, the shockwave speed error was reduced to 8%, significantly improving the reliability of traffic dynamic predictions. The system’s ability to provide actionable insights, such as identifying congestion hotspots and suggesting alternative routes, highlights its practical utility in real-world traffic management. This work makes three key contributions: (1) a robust PINN-TSE framework that embeds physical laws into neural networks, (2) an intuitive LLM-powered interface for real-time traffic interaction, and (3) a demonstration of its effectiveness in real-world settings. By bridging the gap between complex traffic data and human decision-making, this study advances the field of intelligent transportation systems, offering a transformative solution to safer, more efficient, and sustainable traffic management.},

Gold has been considered as the plasmonic metal for the numerical analysis. The low optical loss of ZEONEX in the visible wavelength region, combined with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) frequency of gold occurring in the same spectral range, makes ZEONEX an excellent material choice for SPR-based sensing applications. On the other hand, the humidity insensitivity of ZEONEX makes it well-suited for sensing applications in aqueous environments. The presence of a large side hole facilitates efficient metal coating and easy introduction/removal of the analyte, without adversely affecting the sensor's performance, even with increased hole size. The sensor’s performance has been numerically evaluated for RI of analytes as well as for detecting thickness of biolayer. The analysis reveals a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 3500 nm/RIU and a high resolution of 2.8 × 10⁻⁵ RIU and an amplitude sensitivity of 696 RIU⁻¹.

Traditional approaches generally lack robustness in handling sparse, noisy interaction data and often ignore pedagogical signals critical to effective guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative framework that seamlessly integrates structured time-series modeling, curriculum-guided transformation strategies, and meta-supervised learning into a unified predictive system. Central to our method is the EduFormer model, a Transformer-based network equipped with knowledge-aware attention and curriculum-conditioned normalization, enabling fine-grained understanding of student behavior over time. Complementing this is Curriculum-Adaptive Meta Supervision (CAMS), a dynamic strategy that modulates training with feedback-driven adaptation and progression-aware. This dual framework not only enhances predictive accuracy but also ensures interpretability aligned with educational theories, contributing to transparent and responsible AI practices in adaptive learning systems. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our approach in personalized prediction and pedagogical coherence, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in next-generation adaptive learning systems.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents a sustainable smart packaging system based on Light-based Internet of Things (LIoT) architecture, termed LIoT-based Active Smart Packaging (LIoT-ASP). The proposed solution integrates Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting (PV-EH) and OpticalWireless Communication (OWC) to enable battery-free, energy-autonomous operation for product condition monitoring in retail and logistics environments. A prototype system was developed using commercially available components, incorporating both visible light downlink and Infrared (IR) uplink channels based on consumer device IR protocol-inspired OWC, adapted for low-power operation. The bidirectional OWC supports a data rate of 1.1 kbps, sufficient for periodic sensing and display updates in low-throughput smart packaging applications. The system employs energy-aware control mechanisms and intermittent operation strategies to manage sensing and data communication under variable indoor illumination. Performance of the LIoT-ASP concept was assessed through the developed proof-of-concept prototype system, followed by experimental validation in a real-world scenario involving temperature-sensitive dairy products. The system successfully detected and reported threshold violations via cloud-connected mobile alerts, demonstrating reliable end-to-end functionality.

  abstract     = {Animals in nature possess unique forms of wisdom. In recent years, scientists have increasingly favored methods for emulating animal behaviors to solve problems. Inspired by the unique reproductive behavior of Rhodeus Ocellatus (RO), which involves adaptive trade-off strategies while searching for clams, we propose the Rhodeus Ocellatus Algorithm (ROA) to solve strongly nonlinear problems like wind farm layout optimization (WFLO). Experiment results show that ROA achieves the first place in all 3 CEC test suites. It outperforms other metaheuristic algorithms, demonstrating excellent robustness and the ability to find better solutions for strongly nonlinear problems. In real-life WFLO cases, ROA significantly improves the annual energy performance (AEP) by 9.47% and reduces the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 8.65% compared with the actual layout. The results also show that ROA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving WFLO problem.},

With projections estimating over 38 billion IoT connections by 2030 [1], the need for scalable and context-aware access control mechanisms is critical. Our approach enforces fine-grained, attribute-driven policies that govern both user access and device participation in collaborative model training—without compromising data privacy. By deploying our system on a simulated, resource-constrained smart home testbed, we demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the poisoning attack surface by preventing unauthorized/stale clients and unauthorized access while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that our method enhances security, preserves the privacy guarantees of FL, and remains feasible for real-world deployment in decentralized smart environments.},

When the number of users exceeds the number of BSAs, user selection becomes necessary, typically managed in zero-forcing beamforming using semi-orthogonal user selection. However, integrating this approach with deep learning-based beamforming remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based unified beamforming and user selection method that scales efficiently with the number of users and BSAs. This approach jointly optimizes beamforming and user selection by introducing a user selection number pursuit algorithm and an attention-based message aggregation. Simulation results showthat the proposed method has better sum rates than conventional methods with less computational complexity. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness against imperfect CSI compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Effective handover management is crucial for maintaining seamless connectivity in wireless networks, and it becomes increasingly challenging in fifth-generation (5G) networks due to strict Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring reliable and low-latency handovers in high-mobility scenarios for 5G networks by introducing a novel pre-connect handover (PHO) mechanism enhanced with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed approach leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a model-free DRL algorithm, to proactively select the best target cell based on prediction for handover. DQN makes predictive decisions based on Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) values and their rate of change among the candidate cells that a user equipment (UE) can receive signals from simultaneously. To further reduce handover latency and improve reliability, the mechanism incorporates packet buffering at the target cell before handover execution. The DQN-assisted PHO solution is implemented and evaluated using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) integrated with NS3-Gym, focusing on real-time online prediction for high-speed mobility scenarios. Furthermore, this paper explores the feasibility of extending the approach to Multi-Agent DRL (MADRL), where agents manage handovers independently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DQN-assisted PHO significantly improves handover success rates by triggering the handover process 800–900 ms earlier, and the MADRL can also achieve up to 100% success rate for specific scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of DRL-based techniques for enhancing handover reliability and performance in 5G and beyond wireless networks.},

The DS-Atlas is built on a dataset of approximately 1.3 million scientific publications from the Elsevier Scopus database, leveraging Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and dimensionality reduction techniques to generate a semantic representation of the DS research. The DS-Atlas provides interactive operations to explore the dataset by allowing users to focus on specific areas, filter by keywords and/or time periods, and uncover thematic connections and research trends. Examples of concrete tasks that can be addressed by DS-Atlas are discussed to show how the proposed solution can support scholars in the data-driven analysis of the data science literature. As a further DS-Atlas contribution, the paper illustrates an analysis of the Data Science discipline in terms of geographical distribution of influential authors, institutions, and journal in the field.

  abstract     = {In secure communications, the primary focus is on safeguarding the content of the message. In contrast, low probability of intercept (LPI) communications prioritize the privacy of the communication process itself. The most restrictive form of LPI communication, where an adversary attempts to disrupt the communication once its presence is detected, is known as covert communication. To hide the transmitted signal in solar radiation, we propose using the Gaussian quantum states generated by the degenerate parametric down-conversion process with signal photons being modulated with the phase-shift keying (PSK). To detect the transmitted signal, we propose transmitting the unmodulated idler photons (serving as the reference) together with modulated signal photons. To establish the link, we use the spatial light modulator (SLM)-based beam steering. We successfully demonstrate dual-pump-lasers-based degenerate entanglement-assisted (EA) LPI communication at 1 Gb/s over a 1.5 km terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) link. For the same link, the number of achievable EA covert bits for EA covert FSO communication is significantly higher compared to the corresponding classical covert communication scheme.},

Industrial experience shows that it is often easier to overlook environmental behaviors than system specifications, largely because environment assumptions are rarely documented and tend to evolve during system development. This lack of explicit handling introduces uncertainty, which can compromise system safety and correctness. While several approaches address this issue at the code level, their impact at the model level remains underexplored. In this paper, we empirically investigate howenvironmental assumptions influence the satisfaction of safety requirements in behavioral system models.We collected 473 environment assumptions from 95 human modelers and examined them using Jackson’s formalization of the environment and the machine. Based on this analysis, we identify five reusable modeling patterns that enable the explicit integration of environment assumptions into state machine designs and demonstrate how these patterns support the safe evolution of models.},

To address the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models such as DeepLabV3+, we propose HSFC-DeepLabV3+, an enhanced model that significantly improves classification accuracy and efficiency. The model introduces four key enhancements: (1) EnhancedMobileNetV2 as the backbone with SEBlock integration for improved feature extraction; (2) SeparableASPP to reduce computational complexity while preserving semantic context; (3) an FPNFusion module for effective multi-scale feature fusion; and (4) a deeper classification head with multi-layer convolutions and Dropout to boost generalization. Additionally, a hybrid data augmentation strategy combining bilinear interpolation, geometric transformation, and Mixup is employed to enhance model robustness. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art models (e.g., HRNet, PSPNet, and variants of DeepLabV3+), demonstrate the superiority of HSFC-DeepLabV3+. The model achieves improvements of 2.55% in overall accuracy (OA), 4.72% in mean pixel accuracy (MPA), and 9.32% in mean IoU (mIoU), while reducing total loss, validation loss, and training time by 0.065%, 0.076%, and 27.58 hours, respectively.

We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs’ ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

Also, an Ethereum blockchain technology (EBT) with a homomorphic encryption algorithm was implemented on the system to ensure that the original information record is maintained, immutable, tamper-resistant, and transparent throughout the electoral process, and stores the information in a decentralized database application. The system achieved 1,424.501 TPS for 10,000 transactions with a mining time of 7.02 seconds. The biometric (facial and fingerprint) authentication achieved a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.00% respectively.

  abstract     = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that stimulates the brain via electric fields induced by pulsed currents in a coil. Beyond coil design, the pulse waveform also affects neuronal activation, though specific mechanisms remain unclear. A waveform optimization method is presented to improve stimulation selectivity, in which a multiscale model with realistic neuronal morphology quantifies the selectivity index, the induced electric field is parameterized for a pulse parameter controllable TMS discharge circuit, and particle swarm optimization is applied to refine the waveform parameters. Optimized waveforms show the potential to achieve higher selectivity than monophasic waveforms, which are known for relatively high selectivity. The results further show that waveform polarity, defined as the ratio of the positive to negative integrated areas of the induced electric field waveform, plays a key role in selectivity across cortical layers. Other waveform parameters, such as the relative order and amplitude of induced electric field levels, may also affect selectivity, with their influence varying according to neuronal morphology and the local electric field distribution. The neuronal time constant also influences how waveform parameters affect stimulation selectivity. Furthermore, stronger polarity-selectivity correlations are often associated with greater alignment between selectivity and coil heating. The proposed method can enhance TMS selectivity by optimizing stimulation waveforms. The identified patterns may help explain variability in TMS outcomes across different waveforms and between individuals, and support the development of personalized designs that enhance stimulation efficacy while minimizing coil heating.},

  abstract     = {The Serbian EMF RATEL system has been monitoring radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) since 2017. As one of five active European systems for continuous monitoring of RF-EMF, it has been able to provide insight into the long-term, temporal variability of the field, especially in areas with increased sensitivity to RF-EMF exposure. Although it has proven its benefits for the general public and the scientific community, the relatively small number of RF-EMF sensors installed at fixed locations reveals its weakness – the inability to cover larger urban areas and provide adequate information on the spatial distribution of the overall field. The distribution of sensors at scattered points is a consequence of the limited costs of system development, as well as the practical difficulties in obtaining an authorized permit to install sensors at a public or private location, which is crucial for the use of any large number of sensors. Consequently, the EMF RATEL network has been upgraded to perform spatial field analysis by integrating the functionality of the drive test, for the first time among existing monitoring systems, developing it to a higher level and achieving progress in RF-EMF research by establishing a single EMF entity for observing both temporal and spatial changes of RF-EMF in the territory of interest. This paper presents some technical details of the integration of the drive test into EMF RATEL, as well as preliminary quantitative results of the corresponding drive test measurements to validate the approach. The aim of this paper is to encourage other, similar EMF monitoring systems to further develop the topic of RF-EMF observation.},

  abstract     = {Waveform design is a key enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems, where low-latency, high-reliability, and energy-efficient communication are essential. Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-variantwaveform, enhances spectral containment through subband filtering while remaining compatible with OFDM-based architectures. However, conventional UFMC receivers incur high computational complexity due to extended 2N-point FFT processing. Motivated by our prior work on reducing FFT operations in multiuser (MU) OFDM systems, this paper proposes a low-complexity UFMC receiver architecture that replaces the conventional 2N-point FFT with an N-point FFT, thereby reducing computational requirements while ensuring accurate signal recovery. A pilot-assisted channel estimation framework based on least squares (LS) estimation and interpolation is further developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address low-complexity receiver design and channel estimation performance in UFMC. Complexity analysis demonstrates substantial reductions in arithmetic operations, while simulation results confirm comparable bit error rate (BER) and channel estimation accuracy under multipath fading. These findings highlight UFMC as an OFDM-compatible waveform suitable for scalable, low-power, and future wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {Image captioning is an emerging field at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). It has shown great potential to enhance accessibility by automatically generating descriptive text for visual content. For visually impaired individuals, such technologies can transform static visual information into meaningful audio narratives and enable them for greater independence and participation in daily life. This study introduces an explainable image captioning framework for visually impaired individuals with an ability to turn visual scenes into descriptive audio output in real-time. Using the Flickr8k dataset, we trained and tested two different models of image captioning. The first model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically ResNet50, as a visual encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a language decoder. This approach incorporates Grad-CAM so that it can visualize spatial areas affecting each word prediction, and it reaches 0.5222 and 0.1069 of BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores. The second and more sophisticated model has the same CNN encoder, but instead of LSTM, it uses a decoder based on Transformer with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding. An attention-based model showed a significant increase in performance to BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores of 0.6163 and 0.2225. It has word-level self-attention visualizations that come convenient to make it more explainable, as it shows inter-token relationships in the process of caption generation. We also suggest an edge-deployable framework of IoT-enabled wearable devices that would allow local image captioning and real-time speech generation without the use of cloud services. A combination of precision, interpretability, and deployment enables the framework to be a powerful and transparent assistive framework to be used in the real world to support visually impaired individuals.},

When class imbalance is coupled with complex data distribution characteristics, such as noise interference, class overlap, and small disjuncts, these interactions significantly exacerbate the degradation of classification model performance. This paper systematically reviews class imbalance learning algorithms in complex scenarios, aiming to clarify the scope of applicability and underlying mechanisms of specific techniques. Through a critical review of the existing literature, the paper not only summarizes the latest advancements in the field, but more importantly identifies two key research gaps: (1) the limitations of current methods in addressing multi-source complexity scenarios, and (2) the ambiguous delineation of the applicability range of target algorithms. To address these issues, we design a systematic experimental framework to evaluate the performance of imbalanced classification across various complex scenarios. This framework reveals the mapping between different data complexities and algorithm effectiveness, and offers recommendations for the compatibility of techniques with specific scenarios. Finally, the paper provides guidance on matching scenarios with techniques, identifies open challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {In tabular data analysis within biomedical research, achieving high model accuracy is often considered a prerequisite for discussing feature importance, as medical practitioners expect the validity of feature importance to correlate with model performance. In this work, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that even low-performing models can provide reliable feature importance on biomedical datasets. We conduct experiments to observe how feature importance rankings change as model performance progressively degrades. Using three synthetic datasets and four real-world biomedical datasets, we compare feature rankings from the full datasets to those obtained after reducing either the number of samples (samples removal) or the number of features (features removal), using different feature stability indices. Our results reveal that, in both synthetic and real datasets, feature rankings remain stable during performance degradation caused by features removal. In contrast, sample removal introduces greater discrepancies in feature importance rankings as performance deteriorates more severely. By analyzing the distribution of feature importance values and theoretically examining the probability that the model fails to distinguish importance between features, we show that models can still reliably identify feature importance despite performance degradation due to features removal. We conclude that the validity of feature importance can be preserved even at suboptimal model performance levels, as long as the degradation stems from insufficient features rather than insufficient samples. This has a considerable impact on biomedical research, where feature importance analysis plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and translational bioinformatics.},

  abstract     = {The decomposition of monolithic systems into microservices architectures has become a critical challenge in modern software engineering. Whereas traditional approaches rely primarily on structural analysis, emerging semantic approaches promise more accurate decomposition by incorporating the meaning-aware analysis of software artifacts. This systematic literature review presents the first comprehensive analysis of semantic approaches to microservice identification, examination techniques, evaluation methodologies, and practical adoption challenges. We systematically searched the Scopus database for semantic-specific terms. After applying strict inclusion criteria, from an initial corpus of 40 publications, 17 high-quality papers were selected, representing a 48.6% selection rate. Each study was analyzed for its technical approach, evaluation methodology, and practical applicability. Four distinct categories were identified: NLP-based (41%), hybrid (35%), ontology-based (18%), and AI-enhanced (6%). Hybrid approaches demonstrated superior performance (F1-score: 0.81), whereas domain specific models show 15-20% accuracy improvements. The selected studies were published between 2020-2025, with the majority concentrated in 2025. This temporal concentration reflects the emergence of semantic approaches as distinct research areas. Our search covered 2010-2025 but found limited genuine semantic work in earlier years, indicating that semantic microservice identification is a recent phenomenon as evidenced by the current research surge [1], [2]. Semantic approaches consistently outperform traditional methods, achieving 23-45% improvements in coupling reduction and 15-38% enhancements in cohesion. However, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks, limited tool maturity, and insufficient industrial validation. The field must focus on benchmark development, production-ready tools, and industrial case studies.},

  abstract     = {The problem of decoupling capacitor placement is a critical challenge in modern hardware design, as it significantly impacts power integrity and overall circuit performance. The rapid evolution of hardware to meet increasing performance demands presents significant challenges for traditional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which often suffer from prolonged runtimes and limited scalability. Recently, sequential decision-making methods have gained attention for automating partial solutions in hardware design. However, their dependence on a strict ordering of decision elements introduces order bias, which may degrade performance and overlook valid solutions when the optimal solution set is permutation-invariant. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for the problem of decoupling capacitor placement, leveraging its permutation-invariant nature to address these challenges. Unlike sequential decision-making methods that introduce order bias, our approach is the first to leverage a non-autoregressive diffusion model for this task, directly generating an optimized placement solution by iteratively refining a noisy initialization. This allows the model to efficiently explore the solution space while ensuring consistency and high-quality placements. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, including search-based heuristics, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, in both placement performance and data efficiency.},

When a functional test sequence is used for logic diagnosis, it is important to ensure that test compaction does not eliminate useful diagnostic information. This article addresses this problem for the first time by describing a new test compaction procedure for functional test sequences. The ability of a sequence to support logic diagnosis is assessed by performing diagnostic fault simulation. To limit the computational effort, the test compaction procedure incorporates a dynamically changing parameter that limits the number of times diagnostic fault simulation is carried out during compaction. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure, and the use of observation points.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotics offers a flexible alternative to rigid systems, enabling safe and adaptive interaction in biomedical, wearable, and unstructured environments. Among available actuation methods, soft electromagnetic actuators are notable for their fast response, low operating voltage, and ease of integration. However, some designs require pre-stretching mechanism, which produces an external force to maintain the separation between the coil and permanent magnets. Additionally, there is a mechanical complexity and difficulty in calibrating the spring parameters precisely. Furthermore, the pre-stretching mechanism increases the electromagnetic force required to counteract the opposing spring force, leading to a significant increase in power consumption. Therefore, this paper presents MagFlex V-2, a soft actuator featuring an air gap between a coil and permanent magnets, encapsulated in silicone to eliminate the need for pre-stretching. Three evaluation approaches were employed: (1) experimental testing across 0–45 V, (2) finite element simulation in COMSOL, and (3) analytical modeling using energy-based methods and a magnetic dipole field. MagFlex V-2 exhibited voltage-induced contraction, reducing its length from 17.1 cm to 15.1 cm at 42.5 V. The displacement followed a nonlinear voltage relationship, becoming more linear with increased silicone stiffness. In addition, electromagnetic force showed high sensitivity to voltage and air gap, peaking at 7.03 N (analytical) and 7.43 N (numerical) at 0.5mmand 45 V. Furthermore, statistical analysis (p > 0.05) confirmed that silicone damping and elasticity were not significant. Finally, electrical behavior showed close agreement among analytical, numerical, and experimental results at low currents, with deviations at higher voltages attributed to thermal effects.},

Conventional L₁ adaptive control methods typically require accurate knowledge of specific parameters, which may be difficult or impractical to obtain. Furthermore, some parameters vary dynamically with system behavior, and treating them as constant can result in degraded performance. To overcome this limitation, a type-2 fuzzy neural network is employed to compute the low-pass filter parameters online and in real time.

The DC-DC converter based-BLDCM drive topology is widely preferred to suppress CCRs. The improved characteristics such as low mechanical oscillation and stiff-speed regulation of BLDCM drives further introduces undamped AC signals termed as switching frequency harmonics (SFH) which results destabilization of DC-link voltage (DCLV). The different breeds of filter techniques have been recommended to stabilize the DCLV. However, the recommended filters are composed on the basic of concept of low pass filter (LPF) or band-pass filter (BPF). In addition, these filters require a precise coordination with active compensation, current reference and nonlinear interaction. In this context, a quasi-proportional-resonant-compensator (QPRC) has applied to stabilize the DCLV. The QPRC is investigated for an in-front zeta converter (IFZC) assisted-BLDCM drive. The IFZC primarily handles voltage regulation, while the QPRC is incorporated to suppress the SFH of the DCLV. A hardware prototype has been developed, and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization strategy and design.

If the output of each power source is connected in parallel to the dc-link and a converter with the same power rating is used, a redundancy effect can be obtained. The operation of the hybrid PCS system is determined by the state of charge (SOC) of the ESS battery, and the operating power is determined by the PV generation and grid demand power or ESS battery charging demand power. In this paper, we design a Markov model that considers the reliability of the hybrid PCS, the operating mode, the operating power according to the PV generation and demand power, the operating power change due to partial failure, and the on-load and standby redundancy methods, and analyze the reliability along with the verification of the operation through simulation to present design guidelines for securing high reliability of the hybrid PCS system. The result of the reliability analysis based on an operating temperature of 50°C is that the standby method MTTF is 9.8% longer than the on-load method. Also, when PV generation exceeds demand power, the average lifespan is 23.4% longer than below the demand. When demand is 3 kW, the lifespan increases by 31.8% compared to 5 kW, and when demand is 1 kW, the lifespan increases by 12.1% compared to 3 kW.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose significant challenges in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), where the centralized controller often becomes a critical point of failure. As attack strategies grow more advanced, including low-rate and zero-day attacks, there is an increasing need for detection systems that offer both high accuracy and efficient, adaptable performance. In this study, we propose an ensemble-based intrusion detection framework for SDN environments. A central element of the framework is a hybrid feature selection approach that combines Random Forest (RF) feature importance with the Banzhaf Power Index (BPI), a concept from cooperative game theory. This method helps select features that are both relevant and complementary, reducing redundancy and lowering computational demands. The framework incorporates several machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. These models are integrated into four ensemble configurations using voting strategies. We evaluate the framework using two datasets: CIC-DDoS2023, which represents recent and diverse attack types, and a flow-based SDN dataset that simulates controller-targeted attacks. The ensemble models showed strong detection performance across both datasets and in many cases, exceeded existing baseline methods. Beyond accuracy, we also analyzed training time, inference latency, memory usage, and model size. One important observation is that resource usage is closely influenced by the number and type of selected features, emphasizing how dataset characteristics impact deployment decisions. While some models trained in under five seconds with very low memory requirements, others required significantly more resources. Overall, the framework offers a practical and effective solution for real-time DDoS detection in SDN systems.},

Existing heuristic methods lack scalability, and static network embedding techniques fail to capture evolving topologies. This paper proposes ANE-MiST, a novel framework integrating Attributed Network Embedding with Minimum Spanning Tree (MiST) optimization to address these challenges. By leveraging graph machine learning, our model optimizes the design speed and pipe usage for constructing network layouts, where the pipes cover all nodes based on node properties such as geographical coordinate, elevation, and demand volume. Through the concept of network representation learning, the model can capture the dynamics of changes in the water pipeline network layout, whether due to obstacles or sudden destruction such as natural disasters. The model can reconstruct layout without starting from scratch when changes occur in the network. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable water infrastructure design and paves the way for future integration with hydraulic simulation and hybrid graph learning models.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns such as implausible semantic associations (e.g., treating "nostril" as perceivable through smell) related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a practical and cost-effective method for measuring the pitch location in baseball using only a single camera and a radar gun. Pitch location, defined as the position at which a baseball crosses home plate, is a critical metric for both pitchers and batters aiming to improve performance. While commercial systems such as Trackman, Hawk-Eye, and Rapsodo can measure such data, their high cost and complexity limit accessibility, especially for amateur teams. To address this issue, the proposed method estimates the distance between the ball and camera by leveraging the ball’s physical displacement, as measured by a radar gun, and its corresponding pixel displacement in consecutive video frames. Additionally, the angular position of the ball is computed based on its location in the image plane. These parameters are then combined to reconstruct the 2D pitch location. The method is robust against rolling shutter distortion, with detection performance enhanced through a custom-trained YOLO model. Experimental validation was conducted on actual baseball fields, comparing results with those from Rapsodo and an existing monocular method. The proposed method demonstrated superior accuracy, with statistically significant reductions in estimation error. Given its simplicity, low cost, and field-tested accuracy, this approach offers a highly accessible solution for pitch location analysis, particularly in training environments lacking access to high-end tracking systems.},

In this model, in addition to voltage, current, and temperature, it incorporates dV/dt, integrated current, and their exponential moving averages to capture both transient and long-term electrochemical behavior. Comprehensive benchmarking against LSTM, GRU, and LSTM-DNN architectures is conducted using fixed-temperature training data and evaluated under varying ambient conditions ranging from −20°C to +25°C. Results show the proposed model consistently outperforms its counterparts, achieving lower RMSE and MAE across all scenarios, well bounded under 1.09% and 0.85%.

However, conventional OTFS modulation suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), hindering its practical implementation in ground mobile terminals. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a PAPR reduction method based on precoding discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-spread) technique. First, the information symbols are precoded, followed by DFT-spread, and finally inverse discrete Zak transform (IDZT) is applied to achieve OTFS modulation. The precoding DFT-spread ensures that the OTFS modulation output approximates a repetition of the input, thereby achieving the PAPR performance comparable to single-carrier modulation. Furthermore, the proposed method simplifies the modulation architecture by replacing conventional inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT) and Heisenberg transform (HT) with IDZT, effectively reducing implementation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that this method reduces the PAPR of OTFS signal by up to 4.0 dB, outperforming traditional DFT-spread techniques by approximately 1.4 dB.},

  abstract     = {Steganography, the practice of concealing information within seemingly ordinary media, is essential for protecting sensitive data in today’s digital era. As cyber threats evolve and data transmission grows, ensuring secure and undetectable information hiding becomes increasingly challenging. This study introduces two novel Contrast Channel Embedding (CCE) techniques to optimize steganographic embedding: Mid-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (MCCE) and Extreme-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (ECCE). MCCE targets mid-range contrast areas, avoiding extremes, while ECCE leverages extremely low and high contrast regions, excluding the mid-range. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on smooth or textured regions, our approach combines gradient-based contrast analysis with RGB contrast thresholds to identify ideal embedding zones. Low-contrast areas enhance imperceptibility by minimizing visible artifacts but limit embedding capacity. In contrast, high-contrast regions offer greater capacity and robustness due to pixel variation, though they must be selected carefully to preserve image quality. We employ Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution to embed the hidden data efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that MCCE and ECCE significantly enhance steganographic performance over traditional LSB-based techniques in terms of imperceptibility, maintain a reasonable payload capacity, and improve robustness against detection. Specifically, MCCE achieves PSNR improvements of up to 23.077%, 17.942%, and 12.490%, while ECCE achieves 23.050%, 17.915%, and 12.463%. Both methods also yield consistently higher SSIM scores across various images with a fixed message length of 8192 bytes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in providing a comprehensive and secure solution to conceal information in digital images while maintaining visual fidelity.},

For large-scale image reconstruction, our approach uses fully connected layers in a distributed manner, enabling memory-efficient reconstruction even with limited GPU resources.

Our proposed neural network-based method named MSSPlace utilizes images from multiple cameras, LiDAR point clouds, semantic segmentation masks, and text annotations to generate comprehensive place descriptors. We employ a late fusion approach to integrate these modalities, providing a unified representation. Through extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and NCLT datasets, we systematically analyze the impact of each data source on the overall quality of place descriptors. Our experiments demonstrate that combining data from multiple sensors significantly improves place recognition model performance compared to single modality approaches and leads to state-of-the-art quality. We also show that separate usage of visual or textual semantics (which are more compact representations of sensory data) can achieve promising results in place recognition.

The data driven methods often face challenges such as poor adaptability to varying operational conditions and a lack of physical interpretability necessary for understanding degradation processes. By embedding domain-specific physical principles into machine learning models, physics-based features enhance the accuracy and robustness of RUL predictions, delivering reliable results across diverse scenarios.

Results demonstrate that physics informed features using LSTM models outperform other approaches, excelling at capturing temporal degradation patterns and delivering robust, interpretable RUL predictions. It is observed that results of LSTM with the involvement of physical insights have achieved greater results when validated against recent studies based on the error measuring indicators, Root Means Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Existing approaches either rely on laser measurement of a large number of configurations followed by offline selection of an optimal subset—an inherently time-consuming process—or generate optimal configurations solely from joint-space constraints, which are easily affected by the robot’s workspace and the laser tracker’s line-of-sight limitations. In this study, we propose a novel optimization framework that, on the basis of joint-space constraints, incorporates both Cartesian-space constraints and laser-tracker line-of-sight constraints to formulate an optimization model for generating an optimal calibration configuration set. A hybrid WPSO-SQP algorithm—combining the global search capability of inertia-weighted particle swarm optimization (WPSO) with the strong convergence properties of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for nonlinear constrained problems—is then employed to identify the optimal configuration set. To ensure uninterrupted line-of-sight during measurement, a simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the measurement sequence of the selected calibration configuration set. Experimental validation on a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot demonstrates that the proposed method substantially improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of kinematic calibration.},

The framework operates in five systematic stages: (1) constructing a bias dataset from social group–bias property tuples, (2) generating yes/no, wh-, and choice-based prompts using NLP techniques, (3) applying n-gram, cosine similarity, and embedding-based methods for bias detection, (4) employing NSGA-II to select an optimized “Prompt Set,” and (5) measuring fairness via Bias Detection Rate and Preference Rate across demographic categories.We evaluate FairPrompt on two state-of-the-art conversational AI systems—BlenderBot (400M parameters) and GPT-3.5 Turbo—using Random Sampling and BiasAsker as baselines. Across 30 experimental runs with a 30% prompt sample size, FairPrompt demonstrates up to 50% reduction in computational cost while achieving significantly higher bias detection rates and broader coverage across multiple social dimensions (e.g., gender, race, body, ability). These results establish FairPrompt as a scalable, model-agnostic framework for fairness testing in conversational AI, offering a more efficient and comprehensive pathway toward building robust and socially responsible AI systems.},

  abstract     = {The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to deliver ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high data rates, enabling advanced applications such as autonomous unmaned aerial vehicles (UAV) swarms and aerial edge computing. However, realizing this vision in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) requires intelligent and adaptive clustering mechanisms to ensure efficient routing and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-driven framework for dynamic cluster formation and cluster head selection in 6G-enabled FANETs. The system leverages mobility prediction using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a composite optimization strategy based on signal strength and spatial proximity to identify optimal cluster heads. To evaluate the proposed method, comprehensive simulations were conducted in both centralized (5G) and decentralized (6G) topologies using realistic video traffic patterns. Results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in delay, jitter, and throughput, in decentralized scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning with clustering techniques to enhance scalability, stability, and performance in next-generation aerial networks.},

Accurate Doppler bandwidth estimation is critical for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SAR imagery by preserving dominant signal components and suppressing noise. Conventional models, which rely solely on the Azimuth Antenna Pattern (AAP), assume uniform signal attenuation during target illumination. However, in short-range configurations, variations in slant range cause pronounced non-uniform (time-varying) signal attenuation due to propagation loss. This effect can potentially introduce systematic errors in Doppler bandwidth estimation when conventional AAP-based models are applied. The proposed approach incorporates both the AAP and the non-uniform attenuation, resulting in more accurate bandwidth estimates. Experimental validation with simulated and real SAR data demonstrates the improvements. Furthermore, it is shown that the enhanced estimation accuracy leads to measurable SNR gains, underscoring the practical importance of precise Doppler bandwidth estimation in short-range applications.},

This domain faces unique challenges including domain-specific terminology, nested entity structures, and Chinese language processing complexities. This work presents GP-NER, a novel span-based neural framework designed to extract structured entities from Chinese power grid voice dispatch instructions, including domain-specific terminology and nested entity structures. Our architecture combines Chinese-RoBERTa with whole-word masking, BiLSTM sequential modeling, and dual feed-forward networks to generate specialized representations for entity classification and span encoding. GP-NER integrates OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text conversion with downstream entity extraction across nine power grid-specific categories. The core innovation lies in our similarity-based span-type matching mechanism that models semantic relationships between entity types and candidate spans, enabling robust handling of nested and overlapping entities prevalent in technical dispatch communications. Comprehensive 10-fold cross-validation on 2,000 authentic dispatch recordings demonstrates superior performance with 94.93% precision, 96.10% recall, and 95.51% F1-score, significantly outperforming competitive baselines including recent span-based methods. Statistical significance testing confirms these improvements (all p < 0.05). Ablation studies validate individual component contributions, while evaluation on public Chinese NER benchmarks demonstrates generalizability beyond the power grid domain. The framework shows consistent effectiveness across all entity categories, with F1-scores ranging from 94.85% to 95.99%. GP-NER provides an effective solution for domain-specific entity extraction in power grid environments, advancing intelligent grid management through enhanced automated processing and operational safety.},

However, the nonlinear dynamics of electrochemical processes and multi-source battery data present major challenges for data-driven classification tasks. This paper introduces a multimodal Vision Transformer-based framework that leverages feature-level fusion, Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection, and an ensemble decision strategy integrating Support Vector Machine and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. In the proposed approach, voltage, current, and temperature time-series data are transformed into image representations using Continuous Wavelet Transform, and modality-specific features are fused before classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the full-modality configuration achieves superior performance, with a test accuracy of 92.69%, F1-score of 91.27%, and recall of 90.70%. Also, for single-modality fusion scenarios the framework achieves up to 86.89% test accuracy, while dual-modality fusion configurations yield results up to 91.50%, confirming the consistent performance gains obtained as additional modalities are integrated. The application of Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection enhances validation and test accuracies by up to 2.81%. Furthermore, by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance the dataset against class imbalance, the final test accuracy reached 92.93%. SHAP-based interpretability analysis reveals that current-derived features contribute most significantly to class discrimination, improving both transparency and feature relevance. The framework maintains consistently high performance across single, dual, and full-modality scenarios, ensuring the robustness and practical potential for real-world battery diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {The creation of data-driven models for classification problems requires increasing transparency and inferential explainability, especially in high-stakes domains such as health-care, finance, and policy making. Rule-based systems are widely regarded as a strong candidate for the development of models that are also comprehensible to humans. However, the generated rules are often considered individually with minimal or no consideration of their interactions. This research focuses on the adoption of computational argumentation techniques, which allow for rule-interaction for enhanced explainability. In other words, rules can be revoked when new information is introduced, essentially achieving the notion of non-monotonicity. In detail, an empirical work was designed to automatically extract inference rules from datasets of various multi-class classification tasks by using the Logic Learning Machine (LLM) approach. In turn, these rules were integrated within a structured argumentation framework, able to employ abstract argumentation semantics for conflict resolution among contradicting inferences. Findings demonstrated that the LLM technique can indeed extract compact rules with varying degrees of interpretability and predictive power. Furthermore, the argument-based models built on these rules demonstrated improved inferential and explanatory performance on certain datasets. Examples show how a Cohen’s kappa coefficient improved from 0.85 to 0.99 when applying the argumentation-based conflict resolution strategy to the same set of rules generated by LLM. The contribution to the body of knowledge offered to the community is both a customisable approach for rule-extraction from datasets for multi-class problems, via hyperparameter tuning, and a transparent integration strategy with computational argumentation, which is able to enhance human understanding and support justifiability.},

This paper bridges that gap by offering both a comprehensive overview and a detailed analysis of the underlying modulation-induced loss mechanisms. Specifically, the study characterizes time-harmonic losses arising from copper, iron, and magnet components under voltage-source inverter operation. Furthermore, conventional evaluation metrics, such as the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), are analyzed for their effectiveness in capturing time-harmonic motor losses. A novel matrix impedance measurement method is used to capture the motor’s wide-frequency response including the quantification of parasitic inter-winding and winding-to-stator capacitances. Loss-equivalent parameter fitting is employed to achieve high modeling fidelity with manageable computational demands. Incorporating parasitic effects into the overall loss model reveals a distinct switching-frequency dependency in overall system losses. This insight enables the precise determination of an optimal inverter switching frequency that minimizes modulation-induced losses, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of electric drive systems.},

  abstract     = {Intermittent fault diagnosis (IFD) is a vital subject in modern communication and computing networks. Unlike permanent problems, which are simpler to discover and localize, intermittent defects appear irregularly, disappear autonomously, and frequently resemble natural network variations. This renders them more difficult to track, yet significantly disruptive. Modern deep learning methods, such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTMs and their variations, sometimes don’t take long-term dependencies or localized spatial anomalies into consideration. This causes a lot of false alarms and makes the accuracy go down. The lack of annotated intermittent failure datasets and their irregularity make it much harder to train and generalize models. To solve these problems and make dataset-related problems less of a problem, there is a need to create a hybrid strategy that combines Transformer-based temporal modelling with CNN-based spatial feature extraction and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN)-based synthetic data augmentation. The proposed method meets the immediate need for a precise, scalable, and robust IFD solution that works in real time in mission-critical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, that cuts down on false alarms, and that makes the network more reliable. Meticulous preprocessing steps, including normalization, window sliding, and balancing, ensured that the model training received optimal input. The enhanced datasets indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Convolutional Autoencoder.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an enhanced control strategy for a three-phase four-wire four-leg rectifier (3P4W4LR), aimed at improving dynamic and steady-state performances, disturbance rejection, robustness, and implementation efficiency. A nonlinear varying-gain observer (NVGO) integrated with a simple PI controller is proposed for the outer loop to regulate the DC-link voltage under different internal and external disturbances. Unlike traditional disturbance observers, which are highly sensitive to measurement noise and compromise transient response when gains are reduced, the proposed NVGO employs a variable-gain mechanism. High gain value is used during transients to ensure rapid disturbance estimation and rejection, while low gain value during steady-state minimizes noise sensitivity and estimation error. This results in superior disturbance rejection, improved dynamic response, reduced DC link voltage steady-state error, enhanced noise immunity, increased reliability, and reduced system size and cost. For the inner loop, a Grid-Voltage-Modulated Direct Power Control method based on super-twisting sliding mode control is introduced. Operating directly in the synchronous reference frame without relying on phase-locked loop or Park transformations, this approach simplifies implementation while delivering faster transient response, improved steady-state accuracy, and greater resilience to grid current system uncertainties and disturbances. To ensure robust performance, the closed-loop regional stability of the proposed NVGO with PI controller is rigorously analyzed using a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated through both simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Extensive testing under dynamic load conditions, different grid voltage conditions, and DC-link capacitance uncertainty demonstrates the controller’s robust performance and practical viability.},

The dedicated device includes a sensor and actuators in order to assess dynamic control and feedback mechanisms. The comparison comprises two parts: a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis assesses each framework’s architectural and functional dimensions, including modularity, scalability, adaptability, reconfigurability, migratability, protocol support, control integration, intelligence localization, DT aggregation, and provision type. The quantitative analysis benchmarks the frameworks using key performance metrics: synchronization latency, data processing throughput, operational availability, scaling efficiency, reconfiguration time, event response time, and resource utilization cost. The UniTwin framework stands out particularly in terms of modularity, scalability, and real-time efficiency and dominates in the dynamic reconfigurability and integration depth of the DT deployment.},

An empirical approach was adopted, involving 232 university students who voluntarily participated in the experiment. Prototypes of three well-known Massive Open Online Courses platforms (i.e., Coursera, Udemy, and edX) were developed to assess how various user interface design patterns influence user experience. The findings revealed that the aesthetic design of Coursera, including color scheme, content organization, was perceived as the most visually appealing, while Udemy received higher ratings for its typography, i.e, font size, type, and button shape. Coursera also outperformed the other platforms in terms of navigation (e.g., tab navigation, hamburger menu, drop-down, floating action button, listview), customization features (e.g., search filters, font, and background settings), and feedback mechanisms (e.g., toast messages, error alerts, progress indicators, confirmation prompts, and system status updates). Overall, participants reported higher satisfaction with Coursera, and its interface was associated with a lower cognitive load compared to Udemy and edX. These results underscore the importance of thoughtful user interface design in enhancing usability and reducing cognitive effort in mobile learning applications.},

  abstract     = {While smart contracts enhance efficiency and transparency, they raise legal and technical issues. Smart contracts do not involve face-to-face negotiation or discussion, which contributes to difficulty in confirming that both parties agreed to the terms. Moreover, while smart contracts that encode the intention of the parties show up on the blockchain as digital signatures or as preprogrammed actions, this begs the question as to precisely whether this reflects their intention and mutual consent in the first place. Furthermore, the execution of offer and acceptance in an automated manner poses a challenge to the traditional principles of contract law, as it may rely on adhesion contracts that limit the opportunities for negotiation. Moreover, the verification of legal capacity of the parties identified under a pseudonym is another challenge in a decentralized blockchain environment, especially for cross-border transactions that set varying legal standards. Through a mixed-methods approach of thematic analysis of interviews and literature review, the research responds to these challenges, across practical and theoretical domains. Proposed solutions include biometric identification, digital identity schemes, and AI-assisted consent verification. The study recommends aligning traditional legal principles with technological advancements and fostering international collaboration to create robust frameworks, ensuring fairness and enforceability in smart contracts. This study concludes that a twin-track approach—combining technological improvements with regulatory adjustments—is critical for ensuring the fairness, enforceability, and reliability of smart contracts.},

Conventional federated learning (FL) approaches falter under non-IID data distributions, adversarial threats, and rapidly changing traffic conditions. This paper introduces FLAA-V2V, a novel FL framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) A reinforcement learning-based adaptive aggregation engine dynamically weights vehicle contributions using context-aware metrics (data quality, network stability), reducing communication overhead by 23% versus FedAvg; (2) A hierarchical privacy mechanism combining Local Differential Privacy (LDP) and Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption (LHE) secures V2V exchanges while achieving 92.3% collision-avoidance F1-score under attacks; and (3) A meta-learning drift detector with Kolmogorov-Smirnov validation and gradient compensation reduces accuracy degradation by 18.7% in non-stationary environments. Evaluated on 200+ autonomous vehicles, FLAA-V2V sustains sub-300ms latency at 95% density and demonstrates 16.1% higher adversarial resilience than state-of-the-art FL baselines. This framework establishes a new paradigm for secure, adaptive federated learning in mission-critical ITS applications.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to reduce the annotation costs of training semantic segmentation networks by leveraging weak supervision. Although class labels are a widely used form of weak supervision, annotating all object categories within scene-level images remains both labor-intensive and error-prone, since annotators must exhaustively verify the presence of multiple classes. To overcome this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that relies on only a single positive class label per image as supervision, substantially simplifying the annotation process and enabling more scalable dataset construction. However, using single positive labels introduces challenges, as they can lead to degraded pseudo-semantic masks and hinder network training. To address this, we propose Prediction Score Thresholding (PST) and Permanently-corrected Label Transfer (PLT) to alleviate the degradation problem. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Microsoft COCO 2014 demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance both the quality of the pseudo-semantic mask and the overall WSSS performance, even with extremely sparse supervision.

While manual analysis methods are complex and labor-intensive, deep learning methods have shown potential for automated analysis of the scans. While existing models allow a binary classification, this study uses a novel deep learning-based approach to classify Ground Penetrating Radar B-scan radargrams into three subsurface categories (utilities, cavities, and intact zones) to account for the complexity of real-world subsurface conditions. A ResNet50 model is used with a novel edge preserving preprocessing step to enhance the quality of input data, with the aim to reduce noise in the radargrams while keeping important structural details unblurred. The model shows significant improvements when domain-specific filtering is applied. Balanced accuracy increased from 93.06 % to 96.00 %, setting a new benchmark for Ground Penetrating Radar-based multi-class classification. The results show that combining image enhancement with deep learning can improve the analysis of underground imagery.

In this work, we investigate and compare two text-to-image generative models, DALL·E 3 and Gemini, based on their ability to understand, capture, and represent various aspects of the Saudi cultural legacy, including regional cuisine, traditional fashion, and prominent sites. We utilized a variety of hand-crafted and LLM-generated prompts (using GPT-4) to guide the text-to-image models in generating images of Saudi cultural artifacts, and subsequently evaluated the outputs. We rely on human evaluation guided by a three-fold framework to assess key dimensions of the generative model performance: cultural awareness in the LLM-generated prompts, cultural sensitivity and authenticity in the text-to-image output, and visual and semantic fidelity of the generated images. Our findings indicate that, despite generating high-quality images, both models often struggle to faithfully represent specific cultural artifacts. Hence, further research is needed to improve cultural representation in text-to-image models and to enhance their understanding and perception of diverse cultures.},

However, this field relies on sensitive student data, creating substantial privacy risks and hindering open research. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real data without exposing personal information. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for generating, evaluating, and utilizing synthetic student data based on the widely used Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). We employ two state-of-the-art synthesizers, the Gaussian Copula (GC) and Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), to create synthetic versions of the dataset. The synthetic data are rigorously evaluated against the original data along three critical axes: (1) machine learning utility for predicting student dropout and final grades, (2) statistical quality using the SDMetrics library, and (3) privacy risk via a membership inference attack. Our results show that CTGAN-generated data retains 93.1% of the predictive utility for dropout classification, a statistically significant finding, while also offering strong privacy protection. Conversely, the GC synthesizer produces data with higher statistical fidelity but lower machine learning utility. This work demonstrates that modern synthesizers can produce high-utility, privacy-preserving datasets, providing a viable path for researchers to share and explore rich educational data safely.},

Fostering a cohesive and integrated road safety ecosystem ensures safer road environments that in turn promote safer behaviors.

Studies backed up with theoretical bases such as the theory of planned behavior help in measuring traffic safety cultures through beliefs identification, allowing better support for the design of these initiatives. However, traditional methods of carrying out such studies often rely on surveys and questionnaires which can be cumbersome. As a result, in this work, we investigate a more efficient alternative. We present a general framework to automate the extraction and monitoring of these beliefs from naturally occurring discussions in social media and news platforms. Using text mining and natural language processing, we attempted to discern insights, beliefs, and opinions regarding traffic safety culture. We present an exploratory comparative analysis that combines sentiment analysis, topic classification, and beliefs classification. Our best performing models achieved F1-scores of 0.80 for sentiment classification, 0.61 for topic classification, and 0.72 for belief classification. The results and interpretations obtained throughout this study can be leveraged in building behavior paradigms to predict and influence the way road users act by pruning traffic safety cultures through implementing the right ideologies.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging due to complex tumor boundaries and variations across MRI sequences. Although U-Net is a widely adopted architecture for medical image segmentation, its performance heavily depends on manually defined configurations, which are often suboptimal and labor-intensive. This study proposes GA-UNet, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-assisted framework that automatically optimizes U-Net architectures for multi-sequence brain tumor MRI segmentation. GA-UNet dynamically evolves encoder, bottleneck, and decoder configurations to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The framework is evaluated on two datasets: BraTS 2021, comprising four MRI sequences (T1, T1Gd, T2, FLAIR) for whole-tumor segmentation, and Figshare for multi-class tumor segmentation. GA-UNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9121 on BraTS 2021, outperforming U-Net AG-CHprep (0.9095) and nnU-Net (0.8900). On Figshare, it yields DSC values of 0.9369 (Meningioma), 0.9202 (Glioma), and 0.9226 (Pituitary), with corresponding Jaccard Index (JI) scores of 0.8821, 0.8531, and 0.8582. These results confirm GA-UNet’s robustness in accurately segmenting complex tumor regions across both whole-tumor and multi-class tasks. Additional evaluation using the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and statistical significance testing further validates its performance. Future work will explore 3D segmentation, attention mechanisms, and the integration of more advanced neural architecture search techniques.},

  abstract     = {The Input–Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is a crucial hardware component for enforcing access control for bus-master devices on the main memory. When properly configured by a hypervisor, it provides reliable protection against Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks from untrusted Virtual Machines (VMs) that control DMA-capable devices. Without an IOMMU, a malicious VM could instruct a DMA-capable device that it controls to access memory locations that the VM itself cannot access. This paper describes a novel DMA attack that allows bypassing the access control enforced by an IOMMU and may threaten some dynamic hypervisors. The DMA attack exploits the reallocation of DMA-capable devices when a VM is destroyed and a delay before the device effectively performs DMA. By leveraging a DMA-capable device under its control, this DMA attack potentially enables a malicious VM to breach hypervisor isolation and bypass the IOMMU-enforced access control. The wide applicability of the attack is impacted by constraints at the hypervisor, device, and platform levels. However, to support practicability, we present a proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of the attack on a hypervisor, using a common DMA-capable device in a realistic attack scenario. Finally, the applicability of the attack on other hypervisors and potential mitigation strategies are also discussed. This paper aims to raise awareness of a threat posed by this DMA attack and to encourage practitioners to evaluate and test their systems for such flaws.},

The proposed methodology includes automated segmentation of cycling routes based on slope variation, extraction of statistical and frequency features from physiological, accelerometric, and gyrometric signals, and their subsequent classification using signal processing and computational intelligence techniques. Analysis of 3,526 segmented intervals revealed significant correlations between heart rate variations and slope gradients, as well as estimations of motion symmetry coefficients relevant to biomechanical assessment. The classification accuracy reached 95.5% for motion and physiological features, and 85.6% for gyrometric data using the two-layer neural network model across different slope conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid systems combining wearable sensors and virtual environments for advanced motion analysis. This work underscores the applicability of general-purpose digital signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms in the multichannel analysis of physiological data, with applications in neurology, rehabilitation, and telemedicine.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces explainable deep occupancy, a robust framework empowered by explainable artificial intelligence for high-accuracy occupancy detection and occupant count estimation in smart buildings. Despite the complexity of indoor environments, the proposed framework demonstrates strong performance without requiring filtering or data balancing in the pre-processing phase, utilizing raw signal data from environmental sensors and WiFi access points. The deep learning architecture is based on recurrent neural network models, specifically gated recurrent unit and long short-term memory, to capture temporal dependencies. Gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional long short-term memory models were implemented, along with two hybrid models combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit and bidirectional long short-term memory. The first hybrid merges outputs of both models to enhance representational power. The second model integrates an attention mechanism to focus on critical temporal patterns. All models were evaluated on four datasets collected from three distinct buildings. The hybrid model with the attention mechanism achieved the best performance and was selected for integration into the final framework. To ensure interpretability, the results were analyzed using the Shapley Additive Explanations method, enabling identification of key hardware components and important sensor features contributing to prediction accuracy. Moreover, redundant components with minimal impact were identified, supporting hardware optimization and energy efficiency. The proposed framework achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.999703 for occupancy detection and 0.997917 for occupant count estimation, each obtained on different benchmark datasets. Obtained results demonstrate the framework’s strong generalization capability across diverse indoor environments.},

This paper proposes a dual deep neural network (dual-DNN) approach to accurately distinguish internal faults from simultaneous inrush currents, even under CT saturation. The proposed architecture consists of two stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE)-based networks: a compensation DNN (Com-DNN) and a discrimination DNN (Dis-DNN). The Com-DNN mitigates the adverse effects of CT saturation by learning to recognize and correct distortions in the current signals, while the Dis-DNN discriminates between inrush currents and internal faults. The dual-DNN approach was evaluated using a 23-kV power transformer under various scenarios, including simultaneous inrush and fault events. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers robust performance and stability under challenging conditions. A comparative analysis with a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) and three other existing methods confirms that the dual-DNN approach offers superior dependability and security.

  abstract     = {Lung cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques, especially those based on exhaled breath analysis, have recently garnered significant interest. This study explores a novel approach to lung cancer detection by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, and chloroform present in exhaled breath. Signal processing techniques, including Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), were employed to generate and analyze signals derived from VOC data. Features extracted from these transformed signals were subsequently classified using various machine learning and deep learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A comprehensive comparative evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of WT and WPT on model performance. Results indicate that WPT significantly enhances feature representation, improving classification accuracy across models. Among all evaluated models, the CNN outperformed others, achieving a maximum accuracy of 98.21% when applied to WPT-processed signals. This demonstrates the superior capability of deep learning models in handling complex VOC patterns and highlights their potential in clinical applications. The findings of this research affirm that integrating advanced signal processing techniques with deep learning can substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of non-invasive lung cancer diagnostics. The proposed method offers a promising, efficient, and patient-friendly alternative to conventional diagnostic procedures.},

However, existing event extraction methods encounter challenges in handling long texts and multi-scale semantic relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a joint event extraction model based on sliding window BERT and multi-head latent attention. This model simultaneously extracts event trigger words, subjects, objects, time and location through multi-scale feature fusion and latent variable modeling. Specifically, sliding window BERT is first employed to perform multi-scale encoding on the input text, thereby overcoming the length constraints of pre-trained models and capturing both local and global semantic features. Secondly, a multi-head latent attention mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the cross-head attention weights through latent variables, enabling the modeling of complex dependency relationships between trigger words and arguments. Finally, a joint decoding strategy is adopted, incorporating KL divergence to constrain the latent variable distribution, achieving end-to-end collaborative reasoning for trigger words and arguments. A series of multi-metric experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets such as ACE2005 and CEC 2.0. Experimental results demonstrate that this method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Dental implants are an effective solution for tooth loss, offering long-term success rates exceeding 95%. However, challenges such as surgical complications, improper implant position, and prosthetic inaccuracies persists, often due to operator inexperience or anatomical complexities. Previously, Static Computer-Assisted Implant Surgery (sCAIS) and Dynamic Navigation Systems (DNS) have shown improved precision in implant placement. However, sCAIS often incurs high costs and manufacturing delays, while DNS faces challenges like line-of-sight issues and magnetic interference. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering real-time orientation feedback with advantages such as low cost, portability, and no line-of-sight restrictions. Despite their potential, research on IMU-based guidance for dental implant placement is limited, with unresolved issues related to accuracy under drilling vibrations, device miniaturization, and clinical usability. This paper presents the design and validation of a compact IMU-based system that measures handpiece angulation in real-time, transmitting mesiodistal and buccolingual orientation data to a wireless clinician-worn watch. A thorough validation was conducted to measure both the static and dynamic accuracies, as well as the response time of the system when exposed to dental handpiece drill vibrations. The impact of the built-in filtering features of the IMU and various tuning parameters on performance was also assessed. The validation results indicate that the IMU-assisted implantology device is a cost-effective and adaptable solution for precise implant placement.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a user-centric routing and Adaptive Charging Strategy for EV Charging Station (EVCS) is proposed for reducing the Drive Range Anxiety (DRA) and simultaneously improves battery longevity. An IoT-based app is developed, which first collects user data to route and provide information to the user about various available EVCS with the aid of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The user can choose the charging modes that are Normal Charging (NC) or Adaptive Charging (ADC) and book the time slots as per the availability. In NC mode of charging, the EV battery immediately gets charged once plugged in, which will reduce the DRA. The ADC mode allows the user to choose minimum State of Charge (SoC) i.e., 50% or 70% upto which the battery will be charged after it is plugged in. Thereafter, the EV charging schedule is done according to the Need of Use (NoU) date and time, ensuring a better drive range in case of emergency, thus reducing the DRA. The ADC reduces Capacity Loss (Qloss) of the EV battery, thereby reducing Calendar Aging (CaA). This ensures that the life and health of the EV battery is improved. The proposed scheme for EVCS is validated in real time using the hardware setup that comprises of 120 V, 26 Ah Lead-Acid and 72 V, 30 Ah Lithium-Ion battery charging system that is controlled by WAVECT WCU300 controller interfaced with ESP-32 and Firebase Realtime Database. The comparison analysis shows that ADC reduces capacity loss by 2% with respect to NC. It also improves DRA with respect to Delayed Charging (DC) by 28.07%. Thus, ADC is the best solution for reducing calendar aging and enhancing battery longevity simultaneously.},

To overcome this limitation, the proposed method aims to mitigate CCS-MPCC’s parameter sensitivity while strengthening disturbance rejection in current control. The study first formulates the modeling and control strategies for CCS-MPCC, incorporating the effects of time delay on the dq-axis of the IPMSM. Additionally, the lumped parameter disturbances in the dq-axis are characterized. A detailed analysis of ANN-based SMO is then presented, demonstrating its ability to estimate the lumped parameter disturbances in dq-axis current control. To further enhance performance, an ANN is integrated into the traditional SMO to estimate the dq-axis lumped parameters disturbance, thereby reducing the required switching gains.

Aiming to address the above problems, a method of SINS/GNSS integrated navigation assisted by the tornado optimizer with Coriolis force (TOC) and nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX) is proposed. TOC is employed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of NARX to avoid the problem that a single network is easy to fall into local optimal solution and poor generalization. In the network training phase, the specific force, angular velocity, and the position and velocity increments of SINS are utilized as inputs, while the position and velocity increment of GNSS are used as outputs. When the GNSS signal is rejected, the trained network is utilized to predict the GNSS signal, thereby ensuring the normal operation of the navigation system. To validate the method, a series of simulation experiments were conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of this method is significantly improved compared to pure inertial navigation and unoptimized NARX models. This enhancement can support guided projectile integrated navigation during GNSS signal suppression.},

To improve data confidentiality and preserve control robustness under such conditions, the paper proposes a chaos-based encryption framework for securing bidirectional signal transmission in direct-current (DC) motor control systems. Two distinct Liu chaotic systems are employed—one for encrypting the PWM control signal and another for the motor speed feedback—operating in a master–slave configuration with different initial conditions. Synchronization is maintained via a sliding mode controller, while an adaptive disturbance observer (DOB) enhances robustness against external disturbances. Experimental validation on a physical setup with ESP32 microcontrollers and a separately excited DC motor demonstrates that, although the proposed scheme cannot prevent packet interception itself, it protects the payload from eavesdroppers and enables the system to maintain bounded synchronization errors and acceptable motor response even under MITM-induced delay and packet loss.},

In this study, the performance of the Logistic Regression model, one of the traditional machine learning techniques, was investigated in both default and optimized hyperparameter forms. The LSTM structure, which provides good results on sequential data, the BERT model, which has a high ability to represent contextual language, and the Soft-Masked BERT model, designed specifically for the task of spelling error detection, were examined. All models were evaluated on a balanced Turkish dataset containing at least one spelling error based on the sentences in the dataset, and comparisons were made using basic classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The findings show that the Logistic Regression model running with the default parameters failed to distinguish between classes with 0.366 accuracy and F1-score, while the best hyperparameter version of this model provided a significant improvement with 0.675 accuracy and F1-score. The LSTM model achieved partial success in learning sequential structure with 0.713 accuracy and 0.7 F1-score, outperforming the Logistic Regression model. The BERT model achieved 0.886 accuracy and 0.885 F1-score, outperforming both the Logistic Regression and LSTM models. The Soft-Masked BERT model achieved the highest success with 0.897 accuracy and F1-score.

  abstract     = {Failures of digital circuits can cause significant system downtime in industry sectors including manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, and healthcare. While testing methods are valuable to understand how failures can occur, they do not provide real-time early warnings needed to prevent catastrophic failures or forecast maintenance. This paper develops an adaptive online Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) solution for digital circuits that uses SPICE simulations and laboratory experiments to obtain circuit fault behaviors, while addressing the domain discrepancies between simulations and experimental data. The developed PHM solution achieves early fault detection by analyzing the transition behavior—the rising and falling edges—of circuit output voltage signals. Temporal, spectral, and temporal-spectral features are extracted from these transitions. Diagnosis includes fault type classification that localizes the degraded circuit components, and fault value prediction. The fault value is used in conjunction with component degradation models to make a prognosis of the circuit’s remaining useful life. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through implementation on a four transistor NAND gate. The developed adaptive PHM achieves 98.6% fault-type classification accuracy and 0.12 V RMSE in fault value prediction.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twins (DT), and robotics with Advanced Data Science Platforms (ADSP) is rapidly transforming industrial and research landscapes by enabling real-time data processing, intelligent decision-making, and enhanced automation. Over the past decades, with the growing demand for adaptable, expandable, and secure platforms, numerous groundbreaking studies have emerged in the field of ADSP for CPS, DT, and robotics. However, most existing research addresses isolated aspects of AI, CPS, DTs, or robotics, lacking a holistic view of how ADSP expands and optimizes these technologies. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and structured review of the existing methodologies, tools, and techniques at each step of the ADSP workflow, focusing on their applications in CPS, DT, and robotics. Firstly, this survey analyzes the data ingestion phase, focusing on raw data collection architecture, advanced data pre-processing techniques, and data lake integration, while identifying integration and scalability challenges. Secondly, the development methodologies and data analysis techniques within experimental workflows are explored by highlighting widely used tools and real-world case studies. Thirdly, a detailed overview of optimization techniques and deployment strategies is presented, including cloud, edge, and hybrid models, supported by practical deployment examples. Finally, the continuous learning mechanisms are investigated for adaptive system updates, challenges in real-time adaptation, and expanding model performance. Additionally, this survey focuses on evaluation metrics, benchmark studies, and performance comparisons to assess platform efficiency across various domains. This study also explores emerging challenges such as data quality & availability, platform expandability, model transparency, and security, offering insights into future research directions. To ensure the rigor and breadth, this survey is conducted on 319 high-quality studies, state-of-the-art methodologies, and platforms that are selected using the PRISMA methodology from over 600 reviewed publications. By presenting a structured overview of ADSPs, this work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals aiming to utilize data science for innovation in CPS, DT, and robotics.},

The state variables are branch currents in rectangular coordinates and an optimization problem is formulated to determine the system state. RMS measurements are considered to be obtained from smart meters, and a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is allocated at the main substation providing the angular reference. The network is modeled considering three phase unbalanced loads, radial topology and mutual impedances. The objective function, formulated based on the weighted least squares concept, is divided into three parts, aiming to minimize the quadratic difference between estimated values and their corresponding RMS values, phasor measurements and virtual measurements associated with the null power injection buses. Load pseudomeasurements are incorporated as inequality constraints, bounded by upper and lower limits derived from previously estimated values, assuming that the estimation process is performed at regular time intervals to track daily load profiles. This research article also presents a significant contribution for both technical and economic aspects discussion, including the costs associated with the equipments for practical implementation of the monitoring system. Computational simulations are conducted using a 33-bus test feeder and a real university distribution system to demonstrate the results of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models (FM) have proven effective in many speech applications except for speech enhancement (SE), where FM-based SE solutions still fall short with respect to specialized deep architectures. This work seeks to close this gap by systematically assessing and contrasting leading pre-trained FM architectures on a commonly used SE task, namely VoiceBank-Demand, and on the complex Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) challenge. Furthermore, three main ideas will be leveraged to boost FM-based SE models, namely: (i) Attention-based mask generation, (ii) consistency-preserving loss, and (iii) perceptual contrast stretching (PCS). Specifically, frame-level representations are effectively modeled using conformer layers, which leverage an attention mechanism. Inconsistency effects of signal reconstruction from the spectrogram are mitigated by incorporating consistency in the loss function. Finally, PCS is employed to improve the contrast of input and target features according to perceptual importance. All FM-based models generate an Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) from which the estimated clean speech is obtained. Experimental results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND task demonstrate that our approach helps close the gap between FM-based and SOTA SE solutions. When tested on the DNS challenge, the proposed FM-based SE solution compares favorably with previously proposed approaches on perceptual quality metrics, using only 10% of the available training material, though with a trade-off in signal fidelity (SI-SDR) when PCS preprocessing is applied.},

The system under study consists of a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users, with an IRS deployed to enhance propagation conditions. We develop an optimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming precoder at the BS by exploiting the angle-domain characteristics of the propagation paths to suppress inter-user interference. An optimization framework is formulated to configure the IRS phase shifts to maximize each user’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To overcome the non-convexity and complexity of this problem, we propose a quantization-based approximation approach, where the solution for continuous phase values is mapped to discrete quantized levels. This hybrid design ensures near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-aided beamforming and phase quantization algorithm achieves substantial gains in SINR, throughput, and spectral efficiency compared to random phase configurations. Furthermore, increasing the number of IRS elements effectively offsets the performance degradation caused by coarse phase quantization, confirming the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates advanced signal processing methodologies, with a focus on wavelet-based techniques, for the analysis of time-domain partial discharge (PD) signals captured using ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors. The raw signals are systematically processed through a sequence of operations including bandpass filtering, wavelet-based denoising, DC offset removal, and pulse extraction. Each processing stage is critically examined in both time and frequency domains to ensure signal integrity and noise suppression. Emphasis is placed on the optimization of wavelet parameters alongside extraction of key temporal and amplitude-based features such as time difference, charge difference, pulse height, rise time, and pulse width. To address the challenge of identifying the most discriminative features, this work integrates advanced feature ranking algorithms, namely, auto-encoder-based ranking and the ReliefF method. Their effectiveness is evaluated through criteria including training convergence, reconstruction error, and relevant quality metrics. The methodological novelty lies in the systematic fusion of optimized wavelet-based signal conditioning with robust feature selection frameworks, enabling a comprehensive assessment of feature importance and clarity. A total of 7 wavelet transformations with various decomposition levels, 17 wavelet families with various sub-categories and 2 non-wavelets are involved in this study. Comparative analysis between wavelet-based and conventional non-wavelet methods demonstrates the superior performance of the former in terms of feature extraction fidelity and signal enhancement. The findings establish that the proposed clarity-importance ranking framework significantly advances the accuracy and efficiency of UHF PD signal processing. This contributes to enhanced interpretability and reliability in PD diagnostics, thereby supporting more effective monitoring and maintenance of high-voltage insulation systems in real-world applications.},

We conducted online experiments using first-person shooter and racing game prototypes, assessing player experience via questionnaires, performance metrics, and qualitative feedback. Quantitative results revealed no significant overall improvement in immersion or performance. In fact, a statistically significant decrease in Cognitive Involvement (p = 0.03) was observed in the racing game. Qualitatively, while participants noted the high interaction cost, they also expressed interest in the concept for slower-paced genres. Our findings demonstrate that the benefits of a completely clean screen are largely offset by the costs of divided attention, indicating that this strategy is not a universal immersion enhancer. Future research should therefore focus on genre-specific applications and the development of interactive features to mitigate these attentional demands.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents the design, development, and proof of concept of an intelligent decision support system for the interpretation of lung auscultation. The proposed system generates a multimodal representation that integrates acoustic data from auscultation — transformed into a time-frequency representation using the Continuous Wavelet Transform with the Generalized Morse Wavelet family— with clinical information, including body mass index and the presence of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and emphysema. The resulting image is processed by two independent convolutional neural networks based on the SqueezeNet architecture, which estimate the likelihood of pathological lung sounds in the left and right lungs separately. This approach enables precise localization of abnormalities and supports a more objective assessment of auscultation findings. Evaluation on a reserved test set yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.77 for both classifiers. Beyond its immediate diagnostic utility, this study introduces a novel multimodal data-fusion framework that combines clinical and acoustic information for automated lung sound interpretation. Despite the promising results, it should be noted that the system is still in a conceptual phase of development, so further validation will be needed before its implementation in clinical practice.},

However, their increasing adoption has brought to light numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities, some of which remain insufficiently studied. This paper aims to identify and examine underexplored vulnerabilities affecting LLMs, with particular attention to threats that remain underrepresented in current literature. The selection of vulnerabilities is guided by a systematic comparison of four major surveys, prioritizing in-depth analysis for vulnerabilities absent in at least three of these works. The methodological approach combines a targeted literature search across major academic databases with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on relevance, novelty, and the selection of peer-reviewed journal and conference publications.The survey introduces a taxonomy based on the LLM lifecycle (i.e., training, inference, and deployment) through which 17 vulnerabilities are categorized and discussed. Eight emerging threats (e.g., model collapse, gradient leakage, denial-of-service, and dependency risks) receive comprehensive analysis, reflecting their growing relevance and limited prior exploration. The result is a structured taxonomy and in-depth analysis designed to guide both academic investigations and practical efforts toward the secure deployment of LLMs in real-world environments. In addition to mapping the current threat landscape, this survey highlights open challenges and outlines key directions for future research.},

Subsequently, highly discriminative intrinsic mode function components are selected for feature extraction, and the CPO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN-SVM model, thereby improving deep feature representation and fault classification performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the dual-optimizer strategy, demonstrating superior performance in terms of convergence speed, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency, achieving a fault diagnosis accuracy of 98.0%, which is 2.0%–6.0% higher than existing hybrid models. Furthermore, computational complexity analysis confirms the framework’s real-time capability, aligning well with the stringent requirements of high voltage circuit breaker fault diagnosis.},

The proposed system integrates multiple machine learning models—including Random Forest, Neural Network, XGBoost, and others—to detect cyber threats effectively. Binary classification achieved 100% accuracy, while multi-class attack identification reached 99.99% accuracy across all tested models. A hybrid cryptographic scheme combining AES in EAX mode and RSA-OAEP was employed to secure Modbus traffic, increasing entropy from 4.1 to 7.8 bits and providing resistance against entropy-based attacks. Protocol hardening techniques, such as field-level encryption, SHA-256-based integrity checks, and device-role authorization, collectively reduced the overall attack frequency by over 80%. To evaluate hardware-level deployment, the binary classification model was implemented on a Coral Dev Board, achieving a real-time detection latency of 0.38 seconds for both training and testing, thereby demonstrating suitability for edge-based ICS integration. Threat hunting capabilities were enhanced using K-Means clustering and Isolation Forest, enabling the identification of previously unknown attack patterns. This framework delivers a real-time, cryptographically secure, and lightweight defense mechanism against advanced cyber threats in ICS environments.

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of implied volatility surfaces is crucial for option pricing and risk management in financial markets. Traditional parametric approaches, such as the Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) model, often suffer from rigid functional forms that inadequately capture the complex nonlinear patterns observed in real market data, particularly in the tail regions of volatility smiles. This paper introduces a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework specifically designed to learn and reconstruct implied volatility surfaces directly from historical option market prices. Our approach leverages the adversarial training mechanism to generate smooth, market-consistent volatility surfaces that overcome the limitations of conventional parametric models. The proposed GAN architecture incorporates domain-specific constraints and regularization techniques to ensure the generated surfaces satisfy fundamental no-arbitrage conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation using real-world AAPL options data spanning 2016-2020, we demonstrate that our GAN-based approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in reducing pricing errors under the Black-Scholes framework. Specifically, our method achieves a 23.7% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for out-of-the-money options and a 31.4% improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the baseline SVI model. The results indicate particularly substantial improvements in pricing accuracy for deep out-of-the-money options, where traditional models typically exhibit the largest deviations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior stability across different market regimes and provides enhanced generalization capabilities for options with varying maturities and moneyness levels. The proposed methodology offers significant practical implications for derivatives trading, risk management, and model validation in quantitative finance.},

Factors such as antenna placement, signal polarization, tunnel geometry (straight or curved), and dynamic obstructions like pedestrians or vehicles further complicate propagation dynamics. The main goal of this work is to model and validate the impact of tunnel environments on wireless signal propagation using a versatile ray-tracing approach. To address these issues, a robust and adaptive Ray tracing model is developed and validated through extensive real-world experiments. The study evaluates the root mean square delay spread, a key metric for assessing communication link performance and determining the maximum reliable data rate. Results show that tunnel geometry significantly influences optimal polarization, with horizontal polarization recommended for tall, narrow tunnels. Pedestrian obstructions increase delay spread by approximately 50% compared to unobstructed conditions. Additionally, sharp 90-degree corners yield delay spread values four times higher than chamfered corners, accompanied by significant frequency-selective fading. These experimentally validated findings provide essential insights into wireless signal behavior in confined spaces, supporting the development of more reliable tunnel communication systems, with direct relevance to future 6G and IoT applications.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a technology that maximizes the capacity of the power system by dynamically adjusting the system capacity to the actual weather conditions. In DLR approaches, line capacity or ampacity is calculated using thermoelectric conductor models, which are highly sensitive to the effect of wind, especially at low wind speeds, which have the strongest effect on conductor temperature reduction. Due to its powerful cooling effect, wind speed plays an important role in determining conductor temperature. In this paper, experimental tests are conducted to analyze the thermal behavior of four transmission line conductors, i.e., two aluminum alloy conductors (AAAC), one aluminum conductor steel-reinforced conductor (ACSR), and one high-temperature, low-sag conductor (HTLS). The tests were performed in a laboratory environment under controlled temperature and wind conditions. International standards such as IEEE, Cigré and IEC propose formulations for both natural and forced convection, which are evaluated and compared in this paper using experimental laboratory data. The results show that while the proposed natural convection formulations found in the standards give very similar results, forced convection formulations can lead to significant differences in conductor temperature and ampacity prediction. Since forced convection plays an important role in determining the conductor temperature, the results presented in this paper are useful to better understand the effects of forced convection and to avoid miscalculations.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain demand forecasting faces unprecedented challenges due to the complex interplay of multiple information sources, including market dynamics reflected in textual data, historical consumption patterns, and macroeconomic indicators captured through satellite imagery. Traditional forecasting methods primarily rely on historical time series data, failing to leverage the rich contextual information available from heterogeneous data modalities. This paper proposes a novel Causal-Aware Multimodal Transformer (CAMT) framework that systematically integrates textual data from news and social media, time series of historical demand, and satellite imagery reflecting economic activities for enhanced demand forecasting accuracy. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a cross-modal attention mechanism that enables effective fusion of text-temporal-visual representations through learnable inter-modal relationships, (2) a causal discovery-based feature importance evaluation method that identifies genuine causal relationships between different modalities and demand patterns while mitigating spurious correlations, and (3) a hierarchical multi-scale prediction framework that provides coherent forecasts across product, category, and regional levels. The framework is built upon a Vision-Language Transformer architecture with specialized encoders for each modality and a unified decoder for demand prediction. Extensive experiments on the M5 Forecasting Competition dataset, augmented with news articles, social media posts, and corresponding satellite imagery, demonstrate that CAMT achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 12.3% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 15.7% improvement in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to the best performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component, while causal analysis reveals that satellite-derived economic indicators contribute most significantly to long-term forecasting accuracy, whereas textual sentiment shows stronger predictive power for short-term demand fluctuations. The proposed framework offers practical implications for supply chain management by enabling more accurate demand forecasting that considers diverse external factors, ultimately supporting better inventory management and operational planning decisions.},

The problem becomes even more complex due to real-world application limitations, such as having a single camera view and pattern plane. In this work, the problem of specular surface reconstruction from a single viewpoint is formulated as an optimization process that satisfies both geometrical and optical constraints. To this end, a patch-wise approach is developed to complete the entire depth map. For each patch, the optimization process aims to minimize the angle between geometric normals and normals derived from reflections. This process is propagated across the entire depth map to reconstruct the whole surface. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to noise in reflection point correspondences. Since there is no publicly-available dataset for this task, this paper develops a pipeline for generating synthetic data.},

This study integrated longitudinal data from 4,142 singleton pregnancies (including 227 HDP cases) monitored throughout pregnancy at a Shanghai hospital (2016–2024). We constructed a neighborhood-level, multi-source environmental exposure database (temperature/humidity/BE) and compared the performance of multiple models (Discrete-Time Logistic Regression (DTLR), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for HDP risk. We further investigated the association mechanisms between different exposure types and HDP. Key findings include: 1. The XGBoost model achieved the optimal predictive performance (Area Under the Curve, AUC=0.847), outperforming a baseline model that neglected heat-humidity synergy and time-weighting by ΔAUC=0.05 (p=0.013); 2. Each 0.1-unit increase in green view index (GVI) significantly reduced HDP risk by 26% (Odds Ratio, OR=0.74, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.62–0.89), while the street canyon effect (Sky View Factor, SVF >0.6) amplified the risk from equivalent heat exposure by 37%; 3. Cumulative exposure to just 3 days of moderate heat (Moderate Heat Days Lag 4, MHDL4) during the first trimester (<12 weeks) doubled HDP risk (OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.48–2.16), with extreme heat events (Extreme Heat Days Lag 4, EHDL4) exhibiting more pronounced lagged effects (4-day lag OR=2.03). This study elucidates the potential impacts of environmental factors on maternal health, providing a crucial reference for pregnancy health protection and policy formulation amid increasing extreme climate events. These findings provide support for heat-resilient urban planning targeting maternal health in humid-hot megacities.},

However, the presence of outliers across different data types such as visual, textual, and numerical poses a major challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Outlier Optimizer (MOO), a unified framework designed to detect and filter outliers from heterogeneous data modalities within video files. MOO decomposes each video into still images, text, and numeric sequences, allowing specialized algorithms to handle each modality: Nonlocal Means (NLM) for removing Gaussian noise in image frames and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for detecting contextual outliers in textual and numerical data. These filtered components are then recombined into a cleaned, optimized video. The system is trained and evaluated using synthetically generated datasets to simulate real-world noise while ensuring scalability and control. Performance is assessed using Jaccard Similarity Score (JSS) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), with results demonstrating consistent improvements even under high contamination levels (up to 50%), achieving SSIM scores above 0.77 across three domains: medical imaging, remote sensing, and zoomed video data. These results highlight MOO’s potential as an effective and adaptable tool for enhancing the integrity of multimodal video data in complex, real-world environments.},

  abstract     = {The evolving industrial paradigm demands high quality procedures and automation to adapt to dynamic market conditions. As a consequence, novel robotic systems are integrated within the current digital industrial environments ensuring real-time adaptation to production changes and safe operation with humans and machines. Collaborative robots (cobots) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are designed to follow these principles enhancing the current digital industrial revolution. However, while AMRs are subjected to navigation errors, cobots incur in positioning errors due to the stepper motors operation, resulting in a combined interaction error that do not allow a direct accurate operation between these robots. The addressing of this challenge requires the definition of a robust integration framework between these robots that enables the compensation for the interaction errors occurring during their joint operation. To achieve this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel Fictitious Points Compensation Methodology (FPCM) based on contacts on the AMR structure and an appropriate error characterization that compensates the interaction errors, proving that these errors are systematic. Practically, we make use of fictitious points that define the final position of the cobot end-effector to minimize the final interaction error. The validity of the proposal is verified through two practical cases showing angular errors up to 0.04°, and placement errors up to 0.13 mm, which validates both the proposal and the error characterization. Thus, our method efficiently addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous robotic systems within the current industrial paradigm.},
