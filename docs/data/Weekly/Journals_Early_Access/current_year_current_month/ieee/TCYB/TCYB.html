  abstract     = {The tracking control problem for strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics has been extensively studied. However, most existing control approaches require online approximation models and associated a priori assumptions. In order to avoid the necessity of deriving online models, this article proposes a data-driven backstepping control (DBC) approach for a class of strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics. First, unlike the widely-studied adaptive backstepping control approaches, we identify the unknown dynamics of each subsystem based on off-line data and develop a data-driven continuous-time Lyapunov equation return controller, ensuring semi-global exponential stability of the error system. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven dynamic surface control (DDSC) approach for the “complexity explosion” problem in DBC. This approach uses a data-driven LMI to return the controller, ensuring that the error system remains semi-globally UUB, even when the derivative of the virtual controller cannot be calculated. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of DBC and DDSC are verified by simulation examples.},

To address this challenge, a novel probabilistic multi-interval ETP (PMIETP) is proposed, integrated with a time-varying saturation mechanism (TVSM). The PMIETP is designed by combining subinterval triggering thresholds with a probability distribution model, thereby enhancing system performance and adaptability under varying network conditions. To further mitigate the impact of maliciously injected data and improve estimation robustness, a TVSM-based estimator is developed, which employs an adaptive threshold to confine abnormal data within an acceptable range. In addition, a PSO algorithm is employed to fine-tune design parameters, thereby reducing the conservativeness of linear matrix inequality conditions. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee mean-square asymptotic stability and prescribed noise attenuation performance.

To deal with it, this article proposes a novel PFL algorithm, named federated contrastive shareable representations (FedCoSRs), to facilitate knowledge sharing among clients while maintaining data privacy. Specifically, the parameters of local models’ shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, CL is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge. Additionally, to ensure fairness for clients with scarce data, FedCoSR introduces adaptive local aggregation to coordinate the global model involvement in each client. Our simulations demonstrate FedCoSR’s effectiveness in mitigating label heterogeneity by achieving accuracy and fairness improvements over existing methods on datasets with varying degrees of label heterogeneity.},

The misbehaving attacks can cover several types of malicious attacks, such as false data injection, stubborn, and Byzantine, while the network connectivity may be compromised by DoS attacks, potentially resulting in a time-varying and disconnected digraph. To this end, a resilient source seeking algorithm is proposed by designing an auxiliary point for each agent such that the coordination problem is transformed into a point tracking one. A reference velocity is calculated to guide benign robots toward the source, leveraging their historically optimal positions with the highest signal strength. This ensures the auxiliary points converge to the source, clustering benign robots nearby. When DoS attacks occur on some edges, the latest sampling data acquired before the attacks is used to hold the control signals for the robots. Then, sufficient conditions are established through rigorous stability analysis. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed approach extends the safe-kernel-based resilient consensus algorithms to a resilient source seeking algorithm for a general discrete-time second-order dynamics, while also can withstand a mixed cyberattack comprising both misbehaving and DoS attacks.

  abstract     = {FTC, due to its characteristic of fault prevention and mitigation, is an increasingly popular topic in wastewater treatment process (WWTP) for safety purpose. However, the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances inevitably leads to unknown faults in WWTP, making it challenging for fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using existing fault data to ensure continuous safe and stable operation. To address this issue, a knowledge compensation-based active fault-tolerant control (KC-AFTC) is designed in this article. First, a knowledge-based prescribed performance function (KPPF) is introduced to constrain the transient and steady-state performance of WWTP. Then, the proposed KPPF can assist in KC-AFTC to ensure the operation of WWTP with the desirable performance in the event of faults. Second, a knowledge compensation mechanism (KCM), which is extracted from KPPF and the fault data, is employed to reconstruct the control law for different fault conditions in active FTC (AFTC). Then, KC-AFTC can maintain the continuously safe and stable operation of WWTP. Third, the stability of knowledge compensation-based AFTC (KC-AFTC) is demonstrated through Lyapunov theory. Then, the stability analysis can provide theoretical basis for further application of KC-AFTC in practical experiments. Finally, the proposed control method is validated through both a simulation case and a real WWTP. The results demonstrate that KC-AFTC can achieve outstanding performance in terms of stability and fault tolerance.},

  abstract     = {The Bandler–Kohout subproduct (BKS) method acts as one of the two representative fuzzy relational inference (FRI) strategies. Observing the BKS method using constraint modeling, two fuzzy implications, respectively, produce expression to the factors of inference mechanism and rule base. However, these two factors normally reflect different connotations from the perspectives of artificial intelligence applications and logical meaning. Enlightened by such idea, in this study, we propose and investigate the differently implicational BKS (DBKS) method. Initially, main properties of DBKS are validated. The reversibility and interpolativity of DBKS are proved under certain conditions. The equivalent relationship is verified between interpolativity and continuity for DBKS. The robustness of DBKS is confirmed from both the similarity and the extensional hull. Posteriorly, the computational performance of DBKS is analyzed. In DBKS, the preservation of the indistinguishability holds for input fuzzy sets, and it is proved that the first-aggregate-then-infer (FATI) reasoning strategy of DBKS is equivalent to the first-infer-then-aggregate (FITA) one. To improve the computational efficiency, the H-DBKS method is presented. In addition, the fuzzy system is established on the strength of the DBKS method, the singleton fuzzifier and the centroid defuzzifier. Its response function is analyzed and a universal approximator is built by the fuzzy system via DBKS. At the end, we compare the results of DBKS with BKS by virtue of two examples in affective computing. It is discovered that DBKS can create superior forms of FRI in comparison to those produced by BKS.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been viewed widely in many practical applications and caused lots of research interests. A popular solution based on deep learning techniques is first building an anomaly detection model by offline learning on a specific training data and subsequently utilizing the model to detect anomalies in the online setting. On the one hand, previous works have introduced a plenty of learning methods for building anomaly detection models, but it is well known that no one can perform best in all settings. Therefore, there is usually high demand for collecting multiple detection models in practical applications. On the other hand, in view of the limited computing resources in many online anomaly detection applications, it is almost impossible to run multiple detection models simultaneously due to the high time cost. Then, a natural idea is to enhance the general anomaly detection procedure with an effective mechanism for selecting proper models to avoid the high cost caused by executing too many detection models. Previous works focusing on the recommendation either are time inefficient or usually show weak performance, suffering from the missing labels and heterogeneous data characteristics met in real applications. Therefore, it is highly needed to design effective recommendation methods for automatically choosing anomaly detection models. Motivated by the technical challenges, a novel recommendation method for anomaly detection models is proposed in this article. First, a model recommendation framework based on the concept of detectability is introduced, where the detectability of an anomaly detection model is defined using a fine-grained strategy for comparing data characteristics. Then, based on efficient techniques for computing detectability, an efficient model recommendation algorithm is designed. Finally, extensive experimental results are produced on real time series and typical anomaly detection methods, and show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.},

Current learning-assisted CMOEAs are typically crafted by human experts using manually designed techniques, which tend to be overly tuned, ad hoc, and lacking versatility. To alleviate these limitations, this work proposes transforming the online configuration of CMOEA into determinations of discrete and continuous parameters, which are then solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Specifically, the Actor–Critic framework is adapted to determine a factor that defines the environmental selection pressure. The deep Q-learning technique is adopted to determine the operators for producing offspring. Owing to the property of DRL, the configured algorithm can accommodate historical experience, current evolutionary dynamics, and future improvements to achieve self-learning. A new CMOEA is proposed using the automatically configured EA. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks and 21 real-world problems verify that our method significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods. The versatility and superiority of the automatically configured environment and operators over handcrafted methods justify the effectiveness of the automated configuration method, demonstrating a promising direction in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.},

The uncertainty compensation term is generated by a nonlinear observer, while the feedback term is subject to linear constraints on a high order control barrier function (HOCBF) which effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the uncertainty observation error on the safety constraints. Then, inspired by the continuous-time controller, a sampled-data controller is proposed where the feedback control term is obtained by solving a new quadratic program (QP) problem with modified HOCBF constraints to address the challenges posed by sampled-data input. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the robust forward invariance of the safe sets for the sampled-data nonlinear dynamical system.

It then presents the AE-based decentralized fault estimation (FE) and LFC-based distributed fault-tolerant tracking control (FTTC) protocols. These are incorporated into an integrated structure that ensures the robust asymptotic convergence of estimation errors and excellent tracking performance of multi-USVs. Finally, the study derives criteria for an exponential tracking of composite faulty multi-USVs under cyber-attacks using dual-constraint restriction (attack frequency and excitation rate). Comparative simulations substantiate the advantage of the developed integrated FE and FTTC scheme.},

  abstract     = {To combine the strengths of Gaussian and non-Gaussian latent variable models, a novel information fusion strategy has recently been proposed under the deep learning framework. Although promising results have been obtained, the critical structure learning problem remains unsolved, which seriously hinders the automation of data-driven modeling and analytics. In this article, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) method is introduced as a measurement of the AS between two latent variables, which has no restriction in the type of data distribution. Through an assessment on the necessity of adding a new hidden layer into the deep model in each step, an evaluation index is defined for automatic determination of the required hidden layers during the model training process. For time-varying industrial production environments, reconfiguration or updating of the model structure is frequently required. In this case, automated data-driven modeling and structure learning can significantly improve the efficiency of data analytics. Based on the study results obtained from two real industrial examples, the proposed structure learning algorithm is feasible, and the automated data analytics scheme has significantly improved the online prediction performance in time-varying industrial processes.},

Second, to ensure the invariance of the synchronous manifold, an improved interdegree balance condition is proposed as a prerequisite for achieving cluster synchronization of the community network. Third, based on the local state information from adjacent nodes within each community, a time-limited controller is designed to enhance intracommunity coordination while avoiding the adverse effects of intercommunity competition on synchronization. Subsequently, with the help of the matrix decomposition technique and a Lyapunov-like method, several flexible leaderless cluster synchronization criteria are derived by establishing a nontrivial integral inequality and key properties of the intracommunity Laplacian matrix.

  abstract     = {Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid-self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a TCM based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-SSL environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

Time delays due to occasional congestions/attacks in the LFC are often much longer than those from signal transmissions during normal communication, which invalidates the previous stability assessment methods. In this article, a novel stability analysis method for this scenario via a segmented delay description and a switched system is proposed. First, a two-piecewise function is used to describe multisource-induced delays, including large delays under occasional harsh network conditions and small delays under smooth network conditions; thus, a multiarea LFC model with multisource-induced delay is established. The stability criteria, which is based on switched system theory, reveals the relationship between delay characteristics and system stability. Finally, the proposed method is used to assess the delay tolerance of the LFC in traditional/deregulated environments. The results show that even with a large delay causing instability, as long as it meets certain frequency and duration constraints, the LFC remains stable. This novel discovery reflects the essential improvements of the proposed method and is useful for designing better control strategies.},

This article investigates the cybersecurity of dc MGs against FDI attacks and develops a novel model-based observer system. The proposed projection operator (PO)-based UIO is uniquely designed to detect attacks on the transmitted data from other distributed generation units. For this purpose, a bank of PO observers is developed in each distributed generation unit to estimate all neighbor units’ dynamic states. Cyberattack reconstruction compares the remotely observed state values with the measured ones. Afterwards, the detected attack signal values are utilized to restore the integrity of the compromised signals, effectively mitigating the harmful effects of cyberattacks. The most important feature of this scheme, which distinguishes it from similar methods, is that there is no need for a secure channel or additional information transfer in this method. Extensive real-time numerical simulations are performed to assess the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach when subjected to various attack scenarios, demonstrating its advantages over other methods.},

A novel jump model is proposed in this article, where the switching law of subsystems is regulated by the sum of the horizontal and vertical coordinates’ values. This differs from the conventional jump model, which presumes that the transition probabilities are identical in both directions. The proposed jump model can avoid the mode ambiguity problem. Given the openness and sharing nature of communication networks, they are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks that impair system performance. The concept of global time is introduced to help characterize the jump law and construct DoS attack model. Besides, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is utilized to manage the inevitable mismatched mode problem induced by any delay or data dropouts. With the above considerations, several conditions are established for ensuring passivity performance of 2-D MJSs and stabilization when facing DoS attacks. Several equivalent solvable conditions are derived via decoupling strategy and matrix inequality technique.

Although deep-based models have achieved impressive performance, several limitations remain: a single image contains multiple objects with varying scales, complex topological structures, and background interference. These unresolved issues render ORSI-SOD a challenging task. To address these challenges, we introduce a distinctive cross-model nested fusion network (CMNFNet), which leverages heterogeneous features to increase the performance of ORSI-SOD. Specifically, the proposed model comprises two heterogeneous encoders, a conventional CNN-based encoder that can model local features, and a specially designed graph convolutional network (GCN)-based encoder with local and global receptive fields that can model local and global features simultaneously. To effectively differentiate between multiple salient objects of different sizes or complex topological structures within an image, we project the image into two different graphs with different receptive fields and conduct message passing through two parallel graph convolutions. Finally, the heterogeneous features extracted from the two encoders are fused in the well-designed attention enhanced cross model nested fusion module (AECMNFM). This module is meticulously crafted to integrate features progressively, allowing the model to adaptively eliminate background interference while simultaneously refining the feature representations. We conducted comprehensive experimental analyzes on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our CMNFNet over 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

Semi-global stabilization of the overall system is achieved through only minimal modifications to the nominal linear feedback controllers.

Building upon this, a novel adaptive proportional-integral (PI) control approach is developed through the backstepping method and a series of Nussbaum functions. It is demonstrated that the tracking error can meet predefined transient and steady-state performance criteria, ensuring asymptotic tracking and global boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system.

At each iteration, agents make and submit decisions and then receive the cost function values near their decision points rather than the full cost function information. To guarantee the payoff of each network, we design an algorithm named quantized distributed online bandit optimization in two-network (QDOBO-TN). We use dynamic Nash equilibrium regret to measure the positive payoff discrepancy between the decision sequence produced by Algorithm QDOBO-TN and the Nash equilibrium sequence. Furthermore, we propose a multiepoch version of Algorithm QDOBO-TN. The regret bounds for both algorithms are sublinear with respect to the iteration count T.

Building on this, we develop an estimator-based distributed robust preset-time optimization algorithm incorporating ISMC, which is specifically tailored for strongly connected networks. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm features three key innovations: improved precision in convergence time, enhanced robustness against disturbances, and expanded applicability to network topologies. Finally, we validate the preset-time optimization algorithm through numerical simulations, demonstrating that its convergence rate significantly outperforms those of current finite-and fixed-time algorithms.},

  abstract     = {DLP plays a critical role in understanding and forecasting evolving relationships in real-world systems across various domains. However, accurately predicting future links remains challenging, as existing methods often overlook the independent modeling of dynamic interactions within individual nodes and the fine-grained characterization of latent interactions across node sequences. To address these challenges, we propose FineFormer (Fine-grained Interactive Transformer), a novel framework that alternates between self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enhanced with layer-wise contrastive learning. This design enables FineFormer to uncover fine-grained temporal dependencies both within single node sequences and across different node sequences. Specifically, self-attention captures temporal–spatial dynamics within the interaction sequences of individual nodes, while cross-attention focuses on the complex interactions across the sequences of pairs of nodes. Additionally, by strategically applying layer-wise contrastive learning, FineFormer refines node representations and enhances the model’s ability to distinguish between connected and unconnected node pairs during feature refinement. FineFormer is evaluated on five challenging and diverse real-world dynamic link prediction (DLP) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that FineFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in capturing complex, fine-grained interactions in continuous-time dynamic networks.},

A novel formation scheme that integrates RL with a FLS is presented, incorporating actor, critic, and identifier components to estimate the optimal control, the optimal cost function, and the uncertain system dynamics (including unknown nonlinearities, external disturbances, and leader input), respectively. To achieve PT formation, we introduce a prescribed performance function and a filtered variable, which are then used to develop an error transformation function for the controller design. Unlike existing PT control approaches, this method eliminates initial value limitations, ensuring that both the prescribed performance function’s initial condition and the error transformation parameter are independent of the initial tracking error and system dynamics. We further demonstrate that the developed scheme ensures the prescribed performance of the filtered error, guaranteeing that all formation errors converge to a bounded region within the PT while achieving satisfactory transient performance.

  abstract     = {LSOP is an essential research topic in the field of evolutionary computation community. Many large-scale optimization algorithms often maintain a large population for diversity enhancement. However, updating such a large population consumes a significant number of fitness evaluations (FEs), which may lead to the insufficient evolution of the population. In light of this, this article proposes a small-scale learning particle swarm optimization (SSLPSO) for solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). In the small-scale learning mechanism, only up to two representative individuals are updated in every generation to effectively save FEs and prolong the evolutionary generations, so as to refine the solution accuracy. Specifically, we first design a representative individual selection (RIS) strategy to select the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual for updating. Then, we develop a representative individual learning (RIL) strategy, which includes a convergence learning method and a diversity learning method for the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual, respectively. Meanwhile, we further propose an adaptive strategy adjustment (ASA) method based on evolutionary state assessment to determine whether the representative individuals should be updated, further achieving the adaptive adjustment of the evolutionary behavior in the population. Experimental results on the commonly used large-scale test suites, IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2013, show that the performance of SSLPSO is significantly better than, or at least comparable to other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of large-scale competitions. Finally, the application of SSLPSO to a large-scale constrained WDN optimization problem further demonstrates its real-world applicability.},

(2) To ensure that the states converge to a bounded compact set, the convergence analysis uses strong mathematical techniques, such as stopping time theory and the evolution of finite-time stochastic theory, to achieve mean-square and almost certain consensus. (3) An important aspect of this study is the consideration of Markov-switching actuator faults, where fault occurrence and recovery evolve randomly according to a Markov process, introducing additional stochastic uncertainties into the system dynamics.

To overcome this challenge, a novel robust decoupling PPC strategy is developed in this article, in which an online boundary generation scheme and a smoothly constraint switching rule are devised and introduced.

Through stability analysis of equilibrium points, the potential mechanism is qualitatively investigated by which three types of equilibrium points trigger neuronal oscillatory activity. Different dimensions of bifurcation diagrams and other numerical techniques reveal that neuronal firing activity and its dynamic characteristics are regulated by three factors: 1) LAM; 2) the slow variable; and 3) ion channels. Based on bursting activity, the fast-slow variable analysis method is employed to study fold and Hopf bifurcations, and the fast-slow dynamics under synergistic control are elucidated. Notably, coexisting attractors are discovered and found to be closely related to LAM.

A relative-state feedback-based cluster consensus control protocol is designed by considering the cooperative and competitive interaction behavior of agents. Then, the convergence analysis is performed by utilizing the Lyapunov method. This work is then further extended for the ET observer-based output feedback cluster consensus problem.

  abstract     = {This study explores the progression of artificial intelligence (AI) systems through the lens of complexity theory, challenging conventional linear projections of advancement toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We posit the existence of critical points, akin to phase transitions, where increasing system complexity may not lead to greater capability, but rather to performance plateaus or instability. To investigate this hypothesis, we used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the evolution of AI systems, using evaluation benchmark performances as a proxy for complexity. Our simulations modeled the possible characteristics that systems could exhibit when crossing a critical threshold, transitioning from predictable improvement to a regime of erratic, volatile behavior. Practically, we introduced and validated a methodology for detecting these simulated critical transitions algorithmically. We proposed a heuristic Stochastic Gradient Descent-based approach and compared it with established CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) and Lyapunov exponent techniques, to show that different signatures of instability—from abrupt shifts to gradual volatility ramps—can be identified. We contextualized these findings with real-world phenomena, arguing that the empirically observed —“Jagged Capability Frontier” in large language models (LLMs) illustrates the kind of nonlinear performance boundaries that could be sharply accentuated by the onset of criticality. This research contributes not only a novel theoretical framework for understanding potential limits to AI scaling but also a practical, validated methodology for monitoring the systemic stability of AI systems, offering a new dimension to AGI evaluation and safety.},

  abstract     = {Nonstationarity in industrial processes, guided by factors, such as equipment aging and changing upstream load demands, inherently exhibits heterogeneous characteristics. This complex overlay of homogeneous stationarity poses great difficulty in process monitoring and analysis. Therefore, this study presents a new model (Hs-Hn) that peels the homogeneous and heterogeneous nonstationarity, which has four components: a differentiated learning network (DL-Net), a peeling network (Pe-Net), an adaptive reweighting network (AR-Net), and a global decoder network. DL-Net obtains the differentiated representation by leveraging a new differentiated learning approach to unique inputs, which is based on the cognitive understanding and derivation of functional specialization and content learning during network training. The aim is to maximize functional diversity and minimize content overlap. Furthermore, Pe-Net extracts the stationarity and nonstationarity (S-N) components from each differentiated scale, formulated as an encoder–decoder–encoder architecture with an integrated identity subtraction skip connection. A min–max S-N constraint regulates the peeling process and controls the extracted content. AR-Net additionally refines homogeneous stationarity across each scale and reweights the individual components to adaptively adjust their contributions. Last, reweighted components are fused and input into the global decoder to facilitate unsupervised learning. Experimental results on three processes demonstrate the effectiveness of Hs-Hn.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised multiview clustering has garnered considerable attention for its ability to integrate multiview data with limited labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on labeled samples, neglecting abundant unlabeled data, which leads to suboptimal utilization of available prior knowledge. Moreover, existing pairwise constraint propagation-based methods typically follow a two-stage procedure, resulting in unstable clustering outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework that integrates multiview subspace clustering with pairwise constraint propagation, proposing a tensor-based semi-supervised multiview subspace clustering (TSMSC) method with pairwise constraint propagation. Specifically, each view’s subspace representation is decomposed into a consensus part and private parts, enabling the consensus representation to better approximate the low-rank structure. Then, a pairwise constraint propagation method is developed for multiview data, which propagates the initial pairwise constraint through a low-rank matrix completion approach. Finally, observing that the ideal multiview consensus representation and the propagated pairwise constraint matrix share the same low-rank structure, we naturally construct them into a third-order tensor to capture high-order correlations via tensor low-rank representation, allowing for joint optimization within a unified framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.},

The developed sensor event-triggered mechanism comprises two parts, the first one is sensor event-triggered sampling, and the second one is event-triggered information transmission. Due to the presence of the sensor-triggered mechanism, the system states cannot be available in real time. In order to solve this challenge, a signal decomposition and compensation strategy is constructed to balance the intermittent sensor-sampled signals and the real system inputs. Furthermore, the considered actuator faults in each follower are not limited to be finite, the time, frequency and mode of the faults are also unknown. To address the unknown actuator faults in the nonlinear MASs, a resilient fault management mechanism is developed for each follower. Based on the managed actuator faults dynamics, some bounded estimation signals are constructed and the issue of “explosion of complexity” in the backstepping design procedure is eliminated through the application of nonlinear filters with compensation terms. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of developed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiagent systems typically involve a very large number of interactions and conflicts of interest among agents, which presents a significant challenge for achieving stable and efficient adaptive optimal consensus control in real-time. To fill this gap, this article develops a novel federated learning adaptive dynamic programming (FL-ADP) control scheme to solve the massive multiagent mean-field games (MFGs)-based optimal consensus problem. First, the complex interactions of each individual agent with all other agents can be approximated by an average or collective influence in the context of MFGs. Then, a novel undiscounted performance index function involving the mean-field coupling term, the tracking errors and their derivatives is proposed to circumvent the potential impact of the improper discount factor selection and achieve better control performance. By designing the critic–mass neural network structure, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equations are solved to derive the approximate optimal control policy and quantify the probability density function of the collective behavior simultaneously. Additionally, to comply with the required convergence condition of the MFG, a novel event-triggered federated learning mechanism is formulated, which achieves a balance between communication resource consumption and the guarantee of algorithm convergence. On the basis of Lyapunov’s direct method, the tracking errors and the weight estimation errors of all agents are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results of massive multi-uncrewed aerial vehicle systems affirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Based on the designed MEM, the MLF and two data-based system representations, a data-based stabilization criterion is developed, and an estimated region of attraction (ERA) is determined. Simultaneously, the feedback gain and the trigger matrix are co-designed to guarantee the local stability of the closed-loop system. A notable feature of the proposed approach is that the proposed stabilization criteria rely solely on accessible data, without necessitating full knowledge of the system matrices. It makes the approach well-suited for practical applications where precise modeling is difficult or infeasible. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization scheme combining the linear objective minimization method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to maximize the size of the ERA. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm, illustrate the influence of data size, and demonstrate the advantages of the designed MEM in stabilizing DNNs.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce deep evidential segmentation model (DEviS), an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging SL theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable CUP. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering (UAF) module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation. Additionally, two potential clinical trials were conducted using the UAF module. The clinical application conducted on the Johns Hopkins OCT and Duke OCT-DME datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in filtering OOD data. The second trial evaluated its efficacy in filtering high-quality data on the FIVES datasets. At last, the proposed DEviS method was extended to semi-supervised medical image segmentation, where it exhibited strong robustness under noisy conditions.

First, a coordinate transformation is applied to the AUV kinematics to address nonholonomic constraints. A distributed consensus protocol is then used to coordinate the motion of vehicles, and utilizing the transformed kinematic model, the desired linear velocity and approach angles are determined accordingly. By employing the graph representation and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, a robust stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for a delayed network with disturbances. To improve the quality of AUV motion control, on top of the conventional backstepping controller, a sequential optimization procedure is developed for the first time, which enables optimizing the robust performance online while respecting motion constraints. Moreover, the overall stability of the resulting formation system is established.

Second, an augmented observer is designed to estimate the system states and disturbances. The intermittent estimation signal is then used to compensate for external disturbances through a novel trigger sampling mechanism. Third, the FLS is used to approximate the unknown attack signal, and an adaptive output feedback controller is employed to mitigate its impact on the system. Based on these three key techniques, a novel functional dependent on the sampling instants is constructed to analyze semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system and obtain the criterion condition of low conservatism. Additionally, the event-triggering matrix and gains are explicitly solved by matrix transformation. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated via a visual servo control system and a third-order system.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the event-triggered composite control problem for switched two-time-scale systems (TTSSs). First, the stabilization problem of switched TTSSs under switching composite control is addressed. Unlike existing results that require the singular perturbation parameter (SPP) to be sufficiently small or to satisfy specific LMI conditions, an explicit upper bound of the SPP is derived. Then, both SPP-dependent and SPP-independent dynamic event-triggered mechanisms are developed to reduce the computational burden associated with control signal updates in switched TTSSs. These mechanisms are novel in that they incorporate the boundary layer system and explicitly balance the fast and slow time-scale dynamics. Furthermore, two sufficient stability conditions are established: one concerning the upper bound of the SPP and the other concerning the mode-dependent average dwell time, ensuring the stability of switched TTSSs under the respective mechanisms. In addition, Zeno’s behavior is excluded in both cases. Finally, three numerical examples, including a comparative study, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed results.},

Then, the entire helicopter formation is reinterpreted and stabilized by the incremental FASA that offers the replacement of model information, the suppression of lumped uncertainty, and the rearrangement of system dynamics, with mitigated reliance on model accuracy and computing resources. Next, considering the influence of the actuator faults of a single helicopter on the convergence of the entire formation, RL is applied to pursue the optimal control strategy against fault impact through the critic network, which updates along the dynamics revised by the incremental FASA, ensuring satisfactory formation performance throughout the flight, augmenting the cost efficiency of the control scheme, and relieving any means of identification or approximation on helicopter dynamics. Finally, the stability of the control scheme is proved, and numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate it is efficiency.},

Besides, incorporating actuator dynamics (AD)actuator dynamics (AD) into control synthesis and stability analysis is intended to enhance the sensitivity in terms of positioning and the reliability of robot manipulators. Consideration is given to uncertainties in both the robot manipulator and AD to achieve enhanced tracking performance. In order to improve the efficiency of the closed-loop control system, uncertainties in the dynamic model and AD were estimated using a self-organized adaptive fuzzy logic (AFL)adaptive fuzzy logic (AFL) framework, and the obtained estimates were applied to the control torque input. In the employed AFL framework, the means and variances of the membership functions (MFs)membership functions (MFs) are updated online in each iteration, enabling a more accurate estimation of uncertainties. The use of the newly created Lyapunov function demonstrates that the closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bound.

By designing a sliding flexible PPB, which not only can adaptively adjust the initial boundary according to the initial error, but also dynamically adjust the constraint relaxation according to the coupling correlation between the input constraint and the performance constraint, a novel prescribed performance control (PPC) approach is proposed. Compared with the existing “horn” shape performance boundary-based PPC methods, the limitation of having to repeatedly debug design parameters or sacrifice initial transient performance to meet different initial error requirements is eliminated. Meanwhile, the coupling effect between the input constraint and the performance constraint is also considered, and the balance between input safety and control performance is achieved by constructing an auxiliary system. Furthermore, combining identifier-critic-actor structure-based RL strategy and backstepping technique, a sliding flexible PPB-guided reinforcement learning (SFPPB-RL) optimal control algorithm is developed, which minimizes the cost function while ensuring input safety and prescribed performance indicators. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via simulations.},

Different from the existing approaches, a practically time-synchronized command filtered backstepping (CFB) control scheme is proposed. By integrating modified command filters and control signals designed with norm-normalized sign functions, the newly developed framework not only retains the advantages of the CFB control approach but also guarantees the property of time-synchronized convergence. Specifically, the “explosion of complexity” phenomenon and the influence of filtering errors are simultaneously addressed, and all components of the tracking error can achieve practically synchronous convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time, despite the presence of unmatched nonlinearities in high-order systems. Furthermore, novel auxiliary systems are recursively embedded into each step of the time-synchronized CFB design to counteract the effect of input saturation. Rigorous theoretical analyses and comparative simulations demonstrate the rationality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

To achieve synchronization in a cost-effective manner, we design a novel pinning impulsive control strategy that leverages large-scale impulse delay information together with the number of pinned nodes. By employing an iterative algorithm, we establish a new delay-dependent impulsive differential inequality, which precisely characterizes the convergence domain and provides flexibility in the choice of impulse delays. Then, some quasi-synchronization criteria are derived to guarantee convergence of multilayer networks within a prescribed error level, and explicit analytical expressions for the synchronization error bounds are obtained. Finally, to demonstrate the practical applicability, the proposed criteria are applied to the synchronization of multilayer single-link robot arm networks under error bounds, with numerical examples validating the effectiveness of the method.},

In this article, we develop a novel principal predictor analysis (PPA) framework with RDD to obtain parsimonious predictor models of large-dimensional time series data. Principal predictors are obtained by maximizing the variance of predictions from their past values. Unlike classical principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality without emphasizing the prediction, PPA focuses on extracting latent variables with the maximum predictive capability. The PPA application to dynamic process monitoring is performed with predictive monitoring indices to account for variations in the predictors and the unpredicted residuals, which can be subsequently modeled with PCA. PPA-based monitoring and diagnosis are demonstrated in an illustrative closed-loop system and the industrial Dow Challenge Problem and an extension to include known first-principles relations to show their effectiveness.},

While existing semi-supervised SSE methodologies leveraging pseudo-labeling have achieved promising results, they often overlook the challenges posed by high class imbalance and the prevalence of missing data in ship motion datasets, which restricts their broader applicability. In this article, we propose a novel SSL approach BalanceSSE based on the class-imbalanced ship motion data for SSE. This approach consists of three main modules: 1) the dynamic imputation (DIT); 2) the imbalance temporal-frequency learning (ITFL); and 3) the ClusterProx classifier (CL). The DIT module dynamically imputes incomplete ship motion data by assigning different weights to various dimensions data. The ITFL module employs time-frequency collaborative learning to generate pseudo-labels and integrate an adaptive confidence strategy to select high confidence pseudo-labels. This process is further enhanced by the CL module to produce better estimates. Experimental tests on UCR datasets and ship motion datasets demonstrate that BalanceSSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of each module in BalanceSSE.},

  abstract     = {A key aspect of decentralized multirobot coordination is communication. However, beyond simple signaling, there are only few reports in the literature on the successful evolution of communication, with successes largely dependent on specific tasks and evolutionary setups. Thus, there is a lack of standardized communication frameworks that can be applied to different tasks without the need to redesign, rebuild, or re-evolve the entire system for every new task. In this article, we propose a novel communication module that does not need to be modified for its use in different tasks. Each robot has a coordinate (state) in a virtual communication space. The communication space is partitioned into virtual regions, and each region is linked to a physical behavior, such as seeking resources, phototaxis, or recharging the battery. A robot’s individual behavior is determined by the region to which its current communication state belongs. Since robots can navigate the communication space and continually broadcast their coordinates to neighbors within range, robot swarms can effectively coordinate their behavior in a self-organized manner. We demonstrate that the same evolved communication module is effective in three swarm robotics tasks: 1) the physical aggregation of the robots into groups of a desired size; 2) the formation of desired swarm geometries; and 3) a foraging task based on temporal role allocation. The results show that the communication module provides good and scalable performance in all tasks, representing a significant step toward a task-agnostic communication framework for robot swarms.},

To address this issue, a parallel error-fluctuation suppression control framework is proposed in this work. Specifically, tunable triple-layered error boundaries (i.e., spacing, velocity, and acceleration) are constructed to reactively confine all propagated errors within predefined envelopes. By integrating a Barbalat-lemma-enhanced filtering-compensating mechanism and an adaptive approach based on the approximation capability of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), asymptotic error tracking is realized to proactively suppress potential fluctuations. An adaptive backstepping control approach—integrating proactive and reactive suppression strategies—is then proposed to mitigate the unquantifiable “butterfly effect.” Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Prior studies handled this by using digital representations to train Mod-SbSG players, but accurate representations are often difficult to develop. Hence, our framework replaces digital representations with deep learning methods that learn system dynamics, optimize policies within Mod-SbSG, and reduce real-world interactions. The method includes two main steps: 1) designing deep learning models to predict system dynamics and 2) training Mod-SbSG players in virtual environments. We evaluate single-and multistep predictors and demonstrate network reuse for transfer learning in adaptable systems, which reduces real system interactions by 77.78% in a laboratory testbed industrial control scenario.},
