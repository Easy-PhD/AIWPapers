  abstract     = {This article addresses the output feedback control problem for a specific class of discrete-time fuzzy singularly perturbed systems subjected to nonuniform sampling and a round-robin protocol. An innovative method for modeling nonuniform sampling periods through nonhomogeneous sojourn probabilities is proposed, offering a more intuitive and adaptable framework for system design and analysis. The round-robin protocol is applied to nonuniformly sampled outputs, optimizing information transmission efficiency and enhancing overall system performance. To tackle potential limitations in state data acquisition, a token-dependent static output feedback controller is developed that addresses the complexities introduced by nonperiodic sampling and asynchronous premise variables. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stochastic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to validate and demonstrate effectiveness of the theoretical approach.},

  abstract     = {All-in-one image restoration methods, as opposed to conventional image restoration methods, reconstruct images impaired by various degradations within a unified model, eliminating the need for separate network parameters for each task. However, current all-in-one image restoration approaches tackle various types of image degradation using an identical underlying model, neglecting the inherent variability in complexity across different image restoration tasks, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. To address this limitation, this article introduces the arbitrary routing framework (ARF), designed to effectively assess the difficulty of image restoration tasks and identify the most suitable network structure based on these complexities. This framework can be integrated with existing all-in-one image restoration models, enabling efficient inference by activating various proportions of the entire network, that is subnetworks, based on their task-specific complexities. More specifically, the ARF comprises two principal components: 1) the arbitrary routing backbone (ARB) and 2) a task-specific neural architecture search (T-NAS). The ARB incorporates a routing layer between consecutive convolutional groups, offering a wide array of potential subnetwork configurations while adding only negligible extra parameters. Concurrently, T-NAS autonomously identifies the most effective subnetworks for each image restoration task, optimizing both performance and efficiency through an efficiency-aware reward function. Comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that the ARF significantly improves performance metrics, that is, an increase of 0.31 in reconstruction PSNR, while also achieving a notable reduction in computational demands by 37.1% compared with the benchmark AirNet method. The code has been made available in the supplementary materials.},

To reduce the communication burden of signal transmission between the control box and actuator box or among agents and to enhance the security of information exchange, a dual-link coded scheme is proposed to compress each transmitted information into an L-length string. Furthermore, since the intrinsic complexity of nonlinear systems often causes TPP methods to fail in meeting constraints during the initial stages of operation, an adaptive prescribed performance (APP) scheme is introduced. By utilizing auxiliary functions, the APP is capable of dynamically adjusting performance boundaries, enabling seamless adaptation to varying initial system conditions. As a result, it ensures the tracking error is rigorously guaranteed to remain within a user-defined range over a prescribed time horizon, effectively accommodating diverse initial conditions of the system. By integrating DL-CEC with the APP method, the proposed control strategy ensures bounded consensus tracking with reduced communication cost and prescribed-time performance under arbitrary initial conditions. Simulation experiments corroborate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

To handle this problem, this article proposes a predefined-time safe cooperative control scheme for multiagent systems under output constraints, privacy preservation and unknown disturbances. At the communication layer, an encryption–decryption mechanism is developed to safeguard information exchange among agents, preventing internal states from being identified by eavesdroppers. At the control layer, to ensure strict adherence to output constraints regardless of whether the original command complies with safety limits, an improved boundary protection method is explored to generate a safety reference trajectory, which is subsequently used in the controller design. Adaptive laws are then formulated to counteract the effects of unknown nonlinearities and disturbances. Finally, by leveraging predefined-time stability theory, a predefined-time safe cooperative controller is designed to ensure error convergence within a user-defined settling time. Theoretical analysis rigorously confirms the closed-loop stability, and simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, it is noted that influenced by the seasonal or fitful wind, WTs unavoidably serve in the dynamically varying environment. In this event, most of the currently available indicators expose deficiency in regard of the false or missed alarms due to the coupled condition interference. To address this issue and improve the reliability of the mechatronic system, a novel statistic discrepancy oriented cyclo-non-stationary (CNS) indicator is developed in this article. First, characteristics of the recorded degradation samples are revealed by a multiparametric model, during which the consistency is verified and improved by the hypothesis test. Second, a specific speed-dependent slicing (SDS) operator is then designed, aiming to alleviate the varying-speed-induced modulation interference at the different degradation stages. With this developed SDS operator, a CNS indicator, which can well adapt to the dynamically varying environment during the operating process, is subsequently developed by incorporating the resampling-based statistic discrepancy evaluating mechanism. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively characterize the health state of the transmission parts of the industrial WT under varying speed conditions.},

The key objective of this article is to address this issue by proposing a method that can reasonably simulate the randomness of pedestrian walking and comprehensively extract pedestrian trajectory features. To achieve this, a novel social informer model built upon the informer model is proposed in this article. The social informer utilizes a transformer encoder-based interaction module to comprehensively extract pedestrian trajectory features, which are input into the informer model for further processing. Additionally, an adaptive variance mechanism is proposed to determine the optimal variance and accurately simulate the random nature of pedestrian walking. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated in a comparative experiment on ETH and UCY datasets, with results demonstrating that the proposed model outperforms other models, exhibiting improved accuracy and performance.},

During network transmissions, the signals are exposed to FDI attacks, which occur randomly and follow a Bernoulli distribution. The primary objective is to develop a state estimation algorithm that can handle the TBP, sensor failures, and FDI attacks simultaneously.

By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient values of local objective functions and facilitating local information exchanges among neighboring agents, we construct a set of auxiliary systems that collaboratively seek the optimal solution. The prescribed-time DCO problem is then reformulated as a prescribed-time stabilization challenge of an interconnected error system. We propose a prescribed-time small-gain criterion to characterize the prescribed-time stabilization of the system, presenting a novel approach that enhances effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization methods for interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the auxiliary systems, we design innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers for the subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence is achieved through the introduction of time-varying gains that increase to infinity as time approaches the prescribed deadline. The Lyapunov function, along with prescribed-time mapping, is employed to establish the prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of internal signals.

First, under the transition probability (TP)-based mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching topologies, a distributed objective trajectory achieves almost sure global exponential tracking of the desired formation trajectory. Second, a safe objective trajectory approach is designed by geometrically projecting the unsafe parts of the existing formation trajectory onto the boundary of the obstacle region. Finally, an integral-multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function (IMBLF) is proposed to allow agents to track the safe objective trajectory, where the IMBLF can further guarantee the safety of the MASs. One of the interesting merits of our results is that the impulsive increasing of Lyapunov function at switching instants which is necessary for classical analysis methods has been removed.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning on data streams with concept drift has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Many existing algorithms have achieved promising results on low-dimensional data streams by leveraging unlabeled data and adapting to nonstationary distributions. However, real-world data streams often exhibit complex entanglement and high dimensionality, which are usually overlooked by current approaches, resulting in fragile classification performance. This highlights the need for effective representation learning on evolving data streams to enhance the reliability of model prediction. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm for online semi-supervised learning on high-dimensional data streams by learning from contrastive evolving micro-clusters (MCs), named CEMC. Unlike existing methods, CEMC explicitly mitigates feature entanglement through contrastive MC representation learning, with model initialization guided by contrastive objectives and representation updates triggered by potential drift. To ensure reliable semi-supervised learning, we further model the reliability of contrastive MCs to support online classification and enable rapid adaptation to concept drift. By maintaining contrastive MCs online, CEMC preserves and adapts to evolving concepts within a limited memory budget, while sustaining a discriminative representation space. Empirical results on fourteen real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CEMC compared to six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has garnered extensive attention in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. VLN involves time series information, where historical observations contain rich contextual knowledge and play a crucial role in navigation. However, current methods do not explicitly excavate the connection between rich contextual information in history and the current environment, and ignore adaptive learning of clues related to the current environment. Therefore, we explore a Prompt Learning-based strategy which adaptively mines information in history that is highly relevant to the current environment to enhance the agent’s perception of the current environment and propose a history-guided prompt generation (HGPG) framework. Specifically, HGPG includes two parts, one is an entropy-based history acquisition module that assesses the uncertainty of the action probability distribution from the preceding step to determine whether historical information should be used at the current time step. The other part is the prompt generation module that transforms historical context into prompt vectors by sampling from an end-to-end learned token library. These prompt tokens serve as discrete, knowledge-rich representations that encode semantic cues from historical observations in a compact form, making them easier for the decision network to understand and utilize. In addition, we share the token library across various navigation tasks, mining common features between different tasks to improve generalization to unknown environments. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON, R2R-CE) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Wzmshdong/HGPG.},

Here, we study how individual decision-making behaviors evolve when the topology of network interactions is weighted, and how the network of mixed coordinating and anti-coordinating games is driven to an equilibrium. We prove that the weighted pure coordinating or anti-coordinating decision-making dynamics, under both asynchronous and partially synchronous updates, will converge to the NE after finite strategy switches. Moreover, it follows that the upper bound on the number of switches for the convergence depends on the number of agents and the weights’ distribution under asynchronous update. For mixed coordinating and anti-coordinating games, we find that network game dynamics can be decoupled into convergence and nonconvergence regions under certain conditions, in which the global convergence can be established by adding leaf vertices. For more general cases, we devise the incentive mechanisms for agents to achieve the convergence. We also extend the incentive performance of fully asynchronous updating to the partially synchronous updating. Our results provide hints on the typology and incentive mechanisms to induce the convergence of mixed gaming networks.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization has garnered significant attention, such as in multitask evolutionary optimization (MTEO), which aims to solve complex problems by simultaneously optimizing multiple tasks. While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multidomain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph-learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.},

The attack patterns are modeled stochastically and are constrained by the effective duration of the attack. Explicit upper bounds for both time and ECs are derived, demonstrating their dependence not only on the group size and control parameters, but also on the duration of DoS attacks. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations consistently demonstrate that shorter attack durations facilitate faster convergence and lower energy consumption. Additionally, our analysis uncovers a tradeoff between TC and EC under DoS attacks, suggesting that optimal communication intensity should be carefully adjusted to meet specific performance requirements of practical applications.},

MDT is supposed to improve patient prognosis, making the treatment generation process a multiattribute multiexpert decision-making (MAMEDM) problem. Traditional MAMEDM models often necessitate experts with differing opinions to conform to group consensus, neglecting experts’ willingness to adjust opinions. To address this issue, this study proposes an MAMEDM framework which can maximize experts’ willingness for opinion transformation. Initially, a linguistic scale function is used to preprocess linguistic evaluations. A fuzzy clustering algorithm is introduced to cluster experts. The weights of subgroups are determined based on the network centrality and the professional titles of experts. Expert opinions within subgroups are aggregated based on the principle of maximizing the willingness of experts for opinion transformation, and then the ORESTE method is implemented to rank treatment options. A case study on lung cancer treatment option generation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Results show that considering experts’ willingness to revise evaluations significantly enhances decision acceptance and reduces the impact of noncooperative behaviors.},

To address distributional uncertainty in the follower’s best response, we reformulate the game as a distributionally robust equilibrium-seeking problem and develop a fully distributed FL algorithm. The proposed data-driven approach operates without prior knowledge of system models or disturbance distributions, enabling leaders to estimate states through neighbor communication and local gradient updates. We characterize equilibrium existence in nonconvex settings. The relationship between communication and gradient errors and the energy function of the dynamic system is established.

The external control actions, constituted by a control force exerted on the tip payload and a control torque acting on the disk, occur in dead zone nonlinearity and actuator failure. First, the mathematical expression of dead zone nonlinearity and actuator failure is combined and then divided into a desired control signal and a nonlinear input error. Second, by summing the input errors and external disturbances, adaptive boundary control and parameter compensation laws are designed for the RBBS to ensure vibration attenuation and regulate the rotating speed of the disk to a desired value. Third, the constructed control schemes ensure uniformity ultimately and boundedness regulation of the state variables, which is proved through the Lyapunov direct method.

  abstract     = {The knowledge tracing (KT) aims to track changes in students’ knowledge status and predict their future answers based on their historical answer records. Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting student’ future performance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these approaches ignore the distractors (such as slipping and guessing) in the answering process and overlook that static cognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that there are no distractors in the answering process and that the record representations fully represent the students’ level of understanding and proficiency in knowledge. In this case, it may lead to many lack of synergy and incoordination issue in the original records. Therefore we propose a cognitive representation optimization for KT (CRO-KT) model, which utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize structure of cognitive representations. This ensures that the structure matches the students’ cognitive patterns in terms of the difficulty of the exercises. Furthermore, we use the co-optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representations of the subtarget exercises in terms of the overall situation of exercises responses by considering all the exercises with co-relationships as a single goal. Meanwhile, the CRO-KT model fuses the learned relational embeddings from the bipartite graph with the optimized record representations in a weighted manner, enhancing the expression of students’ cognition. Finally, experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets respectively to validate the effectiveness of the proposed cognitive representation optimization model.

This article introduces distributed control laws that integrate nonholonomic motion constraints into bearing-based designs to enable time-varying formation tracking with minimal onboard resources. Unlike state-of-the-art formation control solutions, this approach maintains formation shape through relative bearing feedback and orientation alignment rather than tracking global target locations or regulating interagent relative positions and velocities. This distributed controller design has been validated in two deployment scenarios: 1) leaderless nonhierarchical formations and 2) leader–follower hierarchical formations. In hierarchical formations, follower agents employ a speed estimator within the orientation alignment framework to reach velocity consensus with the leader agent. The proposed controllers guarantee accurate tracking of time-varying reference trajectories, preserve the desired formation structures, and achieve velocity consensus for both nonhierarchical and hierarchical formations, as established by analysis and validated through simulations and experiments.},

Subsequently, a novel prescribed-time homogeneous domination framework for feedforward MASs is developed. The significant advantage is that this framework combines the low complexity of homogeneous domination control method design with the simplicity of stability analysis for state-scale schemes. Then, based on the recursive techniques, a distributed prescribed-time full-state consensus controller is designed, which drives the consensus errors to reach equilibrium at any prescribed time and ensures the stability of the entire time interval.

  abstract     = {A chain-patterned approach is proposed to achieve the novel leader-following consensus (LFC) with prescribed time-bound and order for MAS under directed chain interaction with increasing scales. Using chain-patterned polynomial encodings, this approach confines all effects of scale variation, thereby accommodating increasing scales without requiring prior knowledge of every interaction at all open moments, like the existing studies. Moreover, TBBG are embedded in this approach to guarantee the novel LFC with prescribed time and bound, while avoiding the infinity-approaching time-varying parameters. Furthermore, the important property order is further enforced and obtained under the proposed approach, conforming to the unidirectional information flow characteristic of chains. Finally, the validity and superiority of the proposed chain-patterned approach are demonstrated by comparative examples.},

  abstract     = {EMTO aims to optimize multiple tasks simultaneously. In recent years, various evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) algorithms based on knowledge transfer (KT) have been developed to utilize the information from other tasks and promote the optimization of the current task. However, most of them often use the fixed KT probability (ktp) and a single evolutionary search operator (ESO) during the evolution process, which lacks an adaption mechanism and cannot meet the different searching requirements among multiple tasks. Fuzzy system can effectively express the qualitative knowledge with unclear boundaries, which has good adaptability to nonindependent EMTO. Therefore, this article proposes a fuzzy adaptive multitask optimization (FAMTO), which employs a fuzzy adaptive transfer (FAT) strategy for intertask KT to achieve the adaptive adjustment of the ktp by designing a comprehensive evaluation in KT performance from two aspects, including the SR and the quality of transferred offspring. In FAT strategy, the fuzzy logical is employed to handle the interdependent relationships among multiple indicators, further achieving the more robust and adaptive ktp adjustment. In addition, an individual-based random selection (IRS) strategy is developed for each individual to choose the suitable ESO for intratask self-evolution in FAMTO. Experimental results show that FAMTO achieves significantly better performance than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms on two well-known multitask benchmarks, CEC17 and CEC22. Furthermore, FAMTO is applied to a real-world multitask planar kinematic arm control application, demonstrating its applicability. Finally, the extended experiments on many-task optimization problems (MaTOPs) illustrate the scalability of FAMTO.},
