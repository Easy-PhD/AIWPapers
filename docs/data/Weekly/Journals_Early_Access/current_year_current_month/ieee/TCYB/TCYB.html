  abstract     = {This article addresses the output feedback control problem for a specific class of discrete-time fuzzy singularly perturbed systems subjected to nonuniform sampling and a round-robin protocol. An innovative method for modeling nonuniform sampling periods through nonhomogeneous sojourn probabilities is proposed, offering a more intuitive and adaptable framework for system design and analysis. The round-robin protocol is applied to nonuniformly sampled outputs, optimizing information transmission efficiency and enhancing overall system performance. To tackle potential limitations in state data acquisition, a token-dependent static output feedback controller is developed that addresses the complexities introduced by nonperiodic sampling and asynchronous premise variables. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stochastic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to validate and demonstrate effectiveness of the theoretical approach.},

  abstract     = {All-in-one image restoration methods, as opposed to conventional image restoration methods, reconstruct images impaired by various degradations within a unified model, eliminating the need for separate network parameters for each task. However, current all-in-one image restoration approaches tackle various types of image degradation using an identical underlying model, neglecting the inherent variability in complexity across different image restoration tasks, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. To address this limitation, this article introduces the arbitrary routing framework (ARF), designed to effectively assess the difficulty of image restoration tasks and identify the most suitable network structure based on these complexities. This framework can be integrated with existing all-in-one image restoration models, enabling efficient inference by activating various proportions of the entire network, that is subnetworks, based on their task-specific complexities. More specifically, the ARF comprises two principal components: 1) the arbitrary routing backbone (ARB) and 2) a task-specific neural architecture search (T-NAS). The ARB incorporates a routing layer between consecutive convolutional groups, offering a wide array of potential subnetwork configurations while adding only negligible extra parameters. Concurrently, T-NAS autonomously identifies the most effective subnetworks for each image restoration task, optimizing both performance and efficiency through an efficiency-aware reward function. Comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that the ARF significantly improves performance metrics, that is, an increase of 0.31 in reconstruction PSNR, while also achieving a notable reduction in computational demands by 37.1% compared with the benchmark AirNet method. The code has been made available in the supplementary materials.},

To reduce the communication burden of signal transmission between the control box and actuator box or among agents and to enhance the security of information exchange, a dual-link coded scheme is proposed to compress each transmitted information into an L-length string. Furthermore, since the intrinsic complexity of nonlinear systems often causes TPP methods to fail in meeting constraints during the initial stages of operation, an adaptive prescribed performance (APP) scheme is introduced. By utilizing auxiliary functions, the APP is capable of dynamically adjusting performance boundaries, enabling seamless adaptation to varying initial system conditions. As a result, it ensures the tracking error is rigorously guaranteed to remain within a user-defined range over a prescribed time horizon, effectively accommodating diverse initial conditions of the system. By integrating DL-CEC with the APP method, the proposed control strategy ensures bounded consensus tracking with reduced communication cost and prescribed-time performance under arbitrary initial conditions. Simulation experiments corroborate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

To handle this problem, this article proposes a predefined-time safe cooperative control scheme for multiagent systems under output constraints, privacy preservation and unknown disturbances. At the communication layer, an encryption–decryption mechanism is developed to safeguard information exchange among agents, preventing internal states from being identified by eavesdroppers. At the control layer, to ensure strict adherence to output constraints regardless of whether the original command complies with safety limits, an improved boundary protection method is explored to generate a safety reference trajectory, which is subsequently used in the controller design. Adaptive laws are then formulated to counteract the effects of unknown nonlinearities and disturbances. Finally, by leveraging predefined-time stability theory, a predefined-time safe cooperative controller is designed to ensure error convergence within a user-defined settling time. Theoretical analysis rigorously confirms the closed-loop stability, and simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, it is noted that influenced by the seasonal or fitful wind, WTs unavoidably serve in the dynamically varying environment. In this event, most of the currently available indicators expose deficiency in regard of the false or missed alarms due to the coupled condition interference. To address this issue and improve the reliability of the mechatronic system, a novel statistic discrepancy oriented cyclo-non-stationary (CNS) indicator is developed in this article. First, characteristics of the recorded degradation samples are revealed by a multiparametric model, during which the consistency is verified and improved by the hypothesis test. Second, a specific speed-dependent slicing (SDS) operator is then designed, aiming to alleviate the varying-speed-induced modulation interference at the different degradation stages. With this developed SDS operator, a CNS indicator, which can well adapt to the dynamically varying environment during the operating process, is subsequently developed by incorporating the resampling-based statistic discrepancy evaluating mechanism. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively characterize the health state of the transmission parts of the industrial WT under varying speed conditions.},

During network transmissions, the signals are exposed to FDI attacks, which occur randomly and follow a Bernoulli distribution. The primary objective is to develop a state estimation algorithm that can handle the TBP, sensor failures, and FDI attacks simultaneously.

By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient values of local objective functions and facilitating local information exchanges among neighboring agents, we construct a set of auxiliary systems that collaboratively seek the optimal solution. The prescribed-time DCO problem is then reformulated as a prescribed-time stabilization challenge of an interconnected error system. We propose a prescribed-time small-gain criterion to characterize the prescribed-time stabilization of the system, presenting a novel approach that enhances effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization methods for interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the auxiliary systems, we design innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers for the subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence is achieved through the introduction of time-varying gains that increase to infinity as time approaches the prescribed deadline. The Lyapunov function, along with prescribed-time mapping, is employed to establish the prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of internal signals. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through a numerical example.},

First, under the transition probability (TP)-based mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching topologies, a distributed objective trajectory achieves almost sure global exponential tracking of the desired formation trajectory. Second, a safe objective trajectory approach is designed by geometrically projecting the unsafe parts of the existing formation trajectory onto the boundary of the obstacle region. Finally, an integral-multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function (IMBLF) is proposed to allow agents to track the safe objective trajectory, where the IMBLF can further guarantee the safety of the MASs. One of the interesting merits of our results is that the impulsive increasing of Lyapunov function at switching instants which is necessary for classical analysis methods has been removed.

  abstract     = {Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has garnered extensive attention in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. VLN involves time series information, where historical observations contain rich contextual knowledge and play a crucial role in navigation. However, current methods do not explicitly excavate the connection between rich contextual information in history and the current environment, and ignore adaptive learning of clues related to the current environment. Therefore, we explore a Prompt Learning-based strategy which adaptively mines information in history that is highly relevant to the current environment to enhance the agent’s perception of the current environment and propose a history-guided prompt generation (HGPG) framework. Specifically, HGPG includes two parts, one is an entropy-based history acquisition module that assesses the uncertainty of the action probability distribution from the preceding step to determine whether historical information should be used at the current time step. The other part is the prompt generation module that transforms historical context into prompt vectors by sampling from an end-to-end learned token library. These prompt tokens serve as discrete, knowledge-rich representations that encode semantic cues from historical observations in a compact form, making them easier for the decision network to understand and utilize. In addition, we share the token library across various navigation tasks, mining common features between different tasks to improve generalization to unknown environments. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON, R2R-CE) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
