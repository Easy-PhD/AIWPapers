  abstract     = {Neural Architecture SearchÂ (NAS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its capability to design neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies (i.e., computationally reduced search configurations). To solve the search stability and searched architecture's generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (referred as $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided, and comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and make the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the proxy robustness problem, we first benchmark differentiable NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers, and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxy settings. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $\beta$-DARTS (termed as Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS. In summary, our search scheme shows lots of outstanding properties for practical applications,},

  abstract     = {The misuse of deep learning-based facial manipulation poses a serious threat to civil rights. To prevent such fraud at its source, proactive defense methods have been proposed that embed invisible adversarial perturbations into images, disrupting the manipulation process and rendering the forged output unconvincing to observers. However, non-targeted disruption of the output may leave identifiable facial features intact, potentially leading to the stigmatization of individuals. In this work, we propose a universal framework for combating facial manipulation, termed ID-Guard. The framework employs a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to generate cross-model transferable adversarial perturbations. We introduce a novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) to suppress identifiable features in manipulated faces. The perturbation generation is optimized by formulating the disruption of various manipulation types as a multi-task learning problem, with a dynamic weighting strategy designed to enhance cross-model performance. Experimental results show that ID-Guard effectively defends against diverse facial manipulation models while degrading identifiable regions in manipulated images. It also enables disrupted images to evade facial inpainting and facial recognition systems. Moreover, ID-Guard can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component into other tasks, such as adversarial training.},

  abstract     = {The cost of finetuning a pretrained model on downstream tasks steadily increases as they grow larger. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back propagation. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Disentangled Transfer Learning (DTL), which disentangles the trainable parameters from the backbone using a lightweight Compact Side Network (CSN). By progressively extracting task-specific information with a few low-rank linear mappings and appropriately adding the information back to the backbone, CSN effectively realizes knowledge transfer in various downstream recognition tasks. We further extend DTL to more difficult tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation by employing a more sparse architectural design. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DTL, which not only reduces a large amount of GPU memory usage and trainable parameters, but also outperforms existing PETL methods by a significant margin in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A common assumption in matrix completion (MC) and tensor completion (TC) is that the missing locations are sampled randomly. However, in real-world scenarios, the unobserved elements are often not arbitrarily located, and may concentrate within entire rows or columns. We refer to this missing mechanism as structural missingness, and traditional MC and TC schemes suffer from drastic degradation under these circumstances. This work addresses the challenge of restoring structural missingness by introducing a novel framework for simultaneously reconstructing multiple matrices, called multi-matrix completion (MMC). In MMC, tri-factorization across matrices captures the correlation between matrices, and Tikhonov regularization on each matrix exploits its correlation. This design enables MMC to efficiently handle both random and structural missingness. In addition, MMC is not affected by the smoothness along matrices which makes it suitable for a wider variety of data compared to Fourier transform based TC methods. The alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to solve the resultant optimization problem. The global convergence of the algorithm is supported by comprehensive theoretical analyses. We demonstrate the versatility of MMC through extensive experiments in image and video restoration, and showcase its superior performance in comparison to traditional MC and TC methods.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by delving into the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, aiming to provide valuable insights by characterizing rigorously the associated upper bounds. Our theoretical results reveal that the stability and generalization of deep GCNs are influenced by certain key factors, such as the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the graph filter operators and the depth of the network. Our theoretical studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, potentially paving the way for developing more reliable and well-performing models.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.},

Although existing CL algorithms have introduced various practical techniques for combating forgetting, little attention has been devoted to studying how data schedules â which dictate how the sample distribution of a data stream evolves over time â affect the CL problem. Empirically, most CL methods are susceptible to schedule changes: they exhibit markedly lower accuracy when dealing with more âdifficult schedules over the same underlying training data. In practical scenarios, data schedules are often unknown and a key challenge is thus to design CL methods that are robust to diverse schedules to ensure model reliability. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of schedule robustness for CL and propose Schedule-Robust Continual Learning (SCROLL), a strong baseline satisfying this desirable property. SCROLL trains a linear classifier on a suitably pre-trained representation, followed by model adaptation using replay data only. We connect SCROLL to a meta-learning formulation of CL with provable guarantees on schedule robustness.

  abstract     = {Event cameras offer significant advantages for low-light video enhancement, primarily due to their high dynamic range. Current research, however, is severely limited by the absence of large-scale, real-world, and spatio-temporally aligned event-video datasets. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 30,000 pairs of frames and events captured under varying illumination. This dataset was curated using a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory, achieving spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm and temporal alignment with errors under 0.01s for 90% of the dataset. Based on the dataset, we propose EvLight++, a novel event-guided low-light video enhancement approach designed for robust performance in real-world scenarios. Firstly, we design a multi-scale holistic fusion branch to integrate structural and textural information from both images and events. To counteract variations in regional illumination and noise, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection, enhancing features from high SNR regions and augmenting those from low SNR regions by extracting structural information from events. To incorporate temporal information and ensure temporal coherence, we further introduce a recurrent module and temporal loss in the whole pipeline. Extensive experiments on ours and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate that EvLight++ significantly outperforms both single image- and video-based methods by 1.37 dB and 3.71 dB, respectively. To further explore its potential in downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, we extend our datasets by adding pseudo segmentation and depth labels via meticulous annotation efforts with foundation models. Experiments under diverse low-light scenes show that the enhanced results achieve a 15.97% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {We propose Lodge++, a choreography framework to generate high-quality, ultra-long dances given the music and desired genre. To handle the challenges in computational efficiency, the complex global choreography patterns across various dance genres, and the physical quality of local dance movements, Lodge++ adopts a two-stage strategy to produce dances from coarse to fine. In the first stage, a global choreography network is designed to generate coarse-grained dance primitives that capture complex global choreography patterns. In the second stage, guided by these dance primitives, a primitive-based dance diffusion model is proposed to further generate high-quality, long-sequence dances in parallel, faithfully adhering to the complex choreography patterns. Additionally, to improve the physical plausibility, Lodge++ employs a penetration guidance module to resolve character self-penetration, a foot refinement module to optimize foot-ground contact, and a multi-genre discriminator to maintain genre consistency throughout the dance. Lodge++ is validated by extensive experiments, which show that our method can rapidly generate ultra-long dances suitable for various dance genres, ensuring well-organized global choreography patterns and high-quality local motion.

  abstract     = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliability of ML models. Most existing methods for OOD detection learn a fixed decision criterion from a given in-distribution dataset and apply it universally to decide if a data point is OOD. Recent work [1] shows that given only indistribution data, it is impossible to reliably detect OOD data without extra assumptions. Motivated by the theoretical result and recent exploration of test-time adaptation methods, we propose a Non-Parametric Test Time Adaptation framework for Out-OfDistribution Detection (AdaODD). Unlike conventional methods, AdaODD utilizes online test samples for model adaptation during testing, enhancing adaptability to changing data distributions. The framework incorporates detected OOD instances into decisionmaking, reducing false positive rates, particularly when ID and OOD distributions overlap significantly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaODD through comprehensive experiments on multiple OOD detection benchmarks, extensive empirical studies show that AdaODD significantly improves the performance of OOD detection over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, AdaODD reduces the false positive rate (FPR95) by 23.23% on the CIFAR-10 benchmarks and 38% on the ImageNet-1k benchmarks compared to the advanced methods. Lastly, we theoretically verify the effectiveness of AdaODD.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic partition processes divide a multi-dimensional space into a number of regions, such that the data within each region exhibit some form of homogeneity. Due to the nature of their partition strategies, partition processes can often create many unnecessary divisions in sparse regions when trying to describe data in dense regions. To avoid this problem we introduce a parsimonious partition model â the Rectangular Bounding Process (RBP) â to efficiently partition multi-dimensional spaces, by employing a bounding strategy to enclose data points within rectangular bounding boxes. The RBP is self-consistent and as such can be directly extended from a finite hypercube to an infinite (unbounded) space. We extend the RBP to establish a data-dependent RBP (data-RBP) to generate bounding boxes only over existing data points in a sequential manner, which can effectively reduce model complexity and enable online learning. To achieve this, we design an alternative way to generate bounding boxes and prove the distributional equivalence between the data-RBP and the RBP when empty boxes are removed. We demonstrate application of the RBP and the data-RBP in three scenarios: regression trees, relational modelling, and random feature construction for online learning. Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the RBP and the data-RBP for both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {3D mask presentation attack detection is crucial for protecting face recognition systems against the rising threat of 3D mask attacks. While most existing methods utilize multimodal features or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals to distinguish between real faces and 3D masks, they face significant challenges, such as the high costs associated with multimodal sensors and limited generalization ability. Detection-related text descriptions offer concise, universal information and are cost-effective to obtain. However, the potential of vision-language multimodal features for 3D mask presentation attack detection remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based prompt learning framework to explore the strong generalization capability of vision-language models for 3D mask presentation attack detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates entities and triples from knowledge graphs into the prompt learning process, generating fine-grained, task-specific explicit prompts that effectively harness the knowledge embedded in pretrained vision-language models. Furthermore, considering different input images may emphasize distinct knowledge graph elements, we introduce a visual-specific knowledge filter based on an attention mechanism to refine relevant elements according to the visual context. Additionally, we leverage causal graph theory insights into the prompt learning process to further enhance the generalization ability of our method. During training, a spurious correlation elimination paradigm is employed, which removes category-irrelevant local image patches using guidance from knowledge-based text features, fostering the learning of generalized causal prompts that align with category-relevant local patches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art intra- and crossscenario detection performance on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods typically leverage augmentation techniques to generate different graph views for comparison, thereby learning corresponding representations for graph-related tasks in label-scarce scenarios. However, existing GCL methods suffer from two primary limitations: 1) they use predefined or one-time perturbations for augmentation, ignoring adaptive noise injection during forward propagation and thus leading to suboptimal model robustness; 2) their contrast mechanisms mainly focus on the agreement of inter-graph representations while neglecting the dimensional feature redundancy within intra-graph representations. To solve these issues, we propose Layer-adaptive-augmentation-based Graph Contrastive Learning with feature Decorrelation (LGCLD). Firstly, the designed layer- wise adaptive augmentation method performs dynamic perturbations while maintaining the semantic similarity between augmented and original graphs, which can improve model robustness. Secondly, we introduce an Agreement-Decorrelation loss (AD loss) that simultaneously optimizes the agreement between graph-level representations and the feature correlation among different dimensions within each graph-level representation, promoting the model to learn informative and non-redundant graph-level representations. Furthermore, we analyze the reasonableness of AD loss through the graph information bottleneck principle. Experiments on various-domain graph datasets demonstrate that LGCLD achieves better or competitive performance compared with a series of state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {In most existing multi-view modeling scenarios, cross-view correspondence (CVC) between instances of the same target from different views, like paired image-text data, is a crucial prerequisite for effortlessly deriving a consistent representation. Nevertheless, this premise is frequently compromised in certain applications, where each view is organized and transmitted independently, resulting in the view-unaligned problem (VuP). Restoring CVC of unaligned multi-view data is a challenging and highly demanding task that has received limited attention from the research community. To tackle this practical challenge, we propose to integrate the permutation derivation procedure into the bipartite graph paradigm for view-unaligned clustering, termed Probabilistically Aligned View-unaligned Clustering with Adaptive Template Selection (PAVuC-ATS). Specifically, we learn consistent anchors and view-specific graphs by the bipartite graph, and derive permutations applied to the unaligned graphs by reformulating the alignment between two latent representations as a 2-step transition of a Markov chain with adaptive template selection, thereby achieving the probabilistic alignment. The convergence of the resultant optimization problem is validated both experimentally and theoretically. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PAVuC-ATS over the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) unifies body, hands, and face motion capture with numerous applications. Despite encouraging progress, current state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural designs on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of scaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we achieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data sources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to ViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To exclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two minimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for hand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces the network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the capture of articulated hands. With big data and the large model, the foundation models exhibit strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turns the generalist into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation models consistently deliver state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA, UBody, EgoBody, and our proposed SynHand dataset for comprehensive hand evaluation.

In contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric details. To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of single-view reconstruction tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To ensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and modalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that drives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only about 3 minute in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency compared to prior works.},

Existing approaches typically address these two factors independently, which often leads to limiting adaptability and overall effectiveness. In this paper, we present a novel meta-learning framework that jointly recommends hyperparameters and initial weights by leveraging dataset similarity. Our method begins by extracting meta-features from a collection of historical datasets. For a given query dataset, similarity is computed based on distances in the meta-feature space, and the most similar historical datasets are used to recommend the underlying parameter configurations. To capture the diverse characteristics of image datasets, we introduce two complementary types of meta-features. The first, referred to as shallow or visible meta-features, comprises five groups of statistical measures that summarize color and texture information. The second, termed deep or invisible meta-features, consists of 512 descriptors extracted from a convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. We evaluated our framework in 105 real-world image classification tasks, using 75 datasets for historical modeling and 30 for querying. Experimental results with both vision transformers and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of dataset-driven parameter recommendation in deep learning.},

Previous works have typically relied on domain-specific solutions to address accuracy and robustness issues in those applications. In this paper, we present a unified framework for a number of foreground segmentation tasks without any task-specific designs. We take inspiration from the widely-used pre-training and then prompt tuning protocols in NLP and propose a new visual prompting model, named Explicit Visual Prompting (EVP). Different from the previous visual prompting which is typically a dataset-level implicit embedding, our key insight is to enforce the tunable parameters focusing on the explicit visual content from each individual image, i.e., the features from frozen patch embeddings and high-frequency components. Our method freezes a pre-trained model and then learns task-specific knowledge using a few extra parameters. Despite introducing only a small number of tunable parameters, EVP achieves superior performance than full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Experiments in fourteen datasets across five tasks show the proposed method outperforms other task-specific methods while being considerably simple. The proposed method demonstrates the scalability in different architectures,pre-trained weights, and tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/NiFangBaAGe/Explicit-Visual-Prompt.},
