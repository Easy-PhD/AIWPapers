  abstract     = {In the evolving field of machine learning, ensuring group fairness has become a critical concern, prompting the development of algorithms designed to mitigate bias in decision-making processes. Group fairness refers to the principle that a model’s decisions should be equitable across different groups defined by sensitive attributes such as gender or race, ensuring that individuals from privileged groups and unprivileged groups are treated fairly and receive similar outcomes. However, achieving fairness in the presence of group-specific concept drift remains an unexplored frontier, and our research represents pioneering efforts in this regard. Group-specific concept drift refers to situations where one group experiences concept drift over time, while another does not, leading to a decrease in fairness even if accuracy (ACC) remains fairly stable. Within the framework of federated learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train models, its distributed nature further amplifies these challenges since each client can experience group-specific concept drift independently while still sharing the same underlying concept, creating a complex and dynamic environment for maintaining fairness. The most significant contribution of our research is the formalization and introduction of the problem of group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart, shedding light on its critical importance in the field of fairness. In addition, leveraging insights from prior research, we adapt an existing distributed concept drift adaptation algorithm to tackle group-specific distributed concept drift, which uses a multimodel approach, a local group-specific drift detection mechanism, and continuous clustering of models over time. The findings from our experiments highlight the importance of addressing group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart to advance fairness in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to seek a complete Pareto front (PF) with different compromise policies in multiobjective Markov decision processes (MOMDPs). However, most MORL algorithms currently have a limitation in handling the MOMDPs with nonconvex PFs. In this article, we propose a nonlinear MORL algorithm based on decomposition and variance reduction (MORL/D-VR) to overcome this limitation. MORL/D-VR adopts the Tchebycheff approach to transform a given MOMDP into a set of single-objective Markov decision processes (MDPs) and subsequently applies an improved policy gradient algorithm, called expected utility policy gradient (EUPG), to solve each single-objective MDP efficiently. We analyze the Pareto optimality of employing the Tchebycheff approach and policy gradient methods that use the full return to update policy for solving MOMDPs. The analysis shows that such a case can identify any Pareto optimal policy regardless of the shape of PFs theoretically. This can provide a theoretical guarantee for applying the Tchebycheff approach and EUPG in MORL/D-VR to obtain the policies within the nonconvex PFs. Moreover, we devise a new baseline for EUPG to reduce the variance of gradient updates and adopt a weight vector adaptation method to improve diversity. The experimental results show that MORL/D-VR achieves a desirable performance in handling problems with different convex and nonconvex PFs and outperforms current state-of-the-art MORL algorithms.},

In this article, we propose a novel dynamic affinity-based PFL (DA-PFL) model to alleviate the class imbalanced problem during federated learning. Specifically, we build an affinity metric from a complementary perspective to guide which clients should be aggregated. We then design a dynamic aggregation strategy that adjusts client aggregation based on the affinity metric in each round, thereby reducing the risk of class imbalance.

Unlike the existing iterative learning method with accumulation of control information, the new PID-type AILC avoids control information accumulation in traditional iterative learning control (ILC), maintaining convergence based on error information and confining iteration to parameter estimation, suitable for amplitude- or frequency-limited controllers. Different from the existing approaches of P-type AILC, this work extends ILC advances to PID-type AILC for nonlinear square or nonsquare systems with unknown control gain matrices, enhancing robustness through simultaneous convergence of integral and proportional error terms over a larger range. This analysis method diverges from traditional approaches relying on contraction mappings or asymptotic stability theorems; error convergence is analyzed using inequalities of a composite energy function (CEF). The effectiveness of this work has been validated through two illustrated examples. The results show that compared with P-type AILC, the convergence speed can be increased by approximately two to three times.},

However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives, including data, features, and systems, making privacy-preserving VAD (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, the current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically review the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. In addition, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code.

To effectively adapt to dynamic changes and achieve a fast convergence rate while maintaining good convergence performance, we design a new algorithm called NGTAdam. This algorithm combines the Nesterov acceleration technique with an adaptive moment estimation method. The convergence of NGTAdam is evaluated by evaluating its dynamic regret through the use of linear system inequality. For online convex optimization problems, we provide an upper bound on the dynamic regret of NGTAdam, which depends on the initial conditions and the time-varying nature of the optimization problem. Moreover, we show that if the time-varying part of this upper bound is sublinear with time, the dynamic regret is also sublinear. Through a variety of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that NGTAdam outperforms state-of-the-art distributed online optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Audio–visual event localization (AVEL) aims to recognize events in videos by associating audio–visual information. However, events involved in existing AVEL tasks are usually coarse-grained events. Actually, finer-grained events are sometimes necessary to be distinguished, especially in certain expert-level applications or rich-content-generation studies. However, this is challenging because they are more difficult to detect or distinguish compared with coarse-grained events. To better address this problem, we discuss a new setting of fine-grained AVEL from dataset to method. First, we constructed the first fine-grained audio–visual event dataset, which is called IT-AVE, relying on videos of playing musical instruments, containing 13k video clips and over 52k audio–visual events. All events are labeled from professional music practitioners, and the event categories are all derived from playing techniques, which are fine-grained with little interclass variation. Next, we designed a new fine-grained event localization method, spatial–temporal video event detector (SVED), which focuses on the challenges that fine-grained events are more imperceptible and prone to be disturbed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments based on the proposed IT-AVE dataset versus fine-grained versions of two existing related datasets, including UnAV-22 derived from UnAV-100 and FineAction-AV derived from FineAction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We hope that this work will contribute to the exploration of an integrated understanding of audio–visual videos.},

To address this limitation, we propose a novel diagnostic framework that integrates a clinical knowledge-based topological graph (CKTG) with a gradient diagnostic strategy featuring a data-driven weighting (GD-DDW) system. The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists’ diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction. This integrated system provides data-driven benchmarks for clinicians, significantly enhancing the precision of melanoma diagnosis.},

This mainly includes human fuzzy instruction reasoning and the following of physical knowledge. Therefore, the embodied intelligence agent must have the ability to model world knowledge from training data. However, most existing vision and language robot manipulation methods mainly operate in less realistic simulators and language settings and lack explicit modeling of world knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and simple robot manipulation framework, called Surfer. It is based on the world model, treats robot manipulation as a state transfer of the visual scene, and decouples it into two parts: action and scene. Then, the generalization ability of the model on new instructions and new scenes is enhanced by explicit modeling of the action and scene prediction in multimodal information. In addition, we built a robot manipulation simulation platform that supports physics execution based on the MuJoCo physics engine. It can automatically generate demonstration training data and test data, effectively reducing labor costs. To conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the visual-language understanding and physical execution of the manipulation model, we also created a robotic manipulation benchmark with different difficulty levels, called SeaWave. It contains four visual-language manipulation tasks of different difficulty levels and can provide a standardized testing platform for embedded AI agents in multimodal environments. Overall, we hope Surfer can freely surf in the robot’s SeaWave benchmark. Extensive experiments show that Surfer consistently outperforms all baselines significantly in all manipulation tasks. On average, Surfer achieved a success rate of 54.74% on the defined four levels of manipulation tasks, exceeding the best baseline performance of 51.07%.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection has shown potential in various fields, such as finance, aerospace, and security. The fuzzy definition of data anomalies, the complexity of data patterns, and the scarcity of abnormal data samples pose significant challenges to anomaly detection. Researchers have extensively employed autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in studying time series anomaly detection methods. However, relying on reconstruction error, the AE-based anomaly detection algorithm needs more effective regularization methods, rendering it susceptible to the problem of overfitting. Meanwhile, GAN-based anomaly detection algorithms require high-quality training data, significantly impacting their practical deployment. We propose a novel GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure to address these issues. The model first processes the data with the generator to obtain the reconstruction error and then calculates pseudo-labels to divide the data into two categories. One data category is input into the first discriminator, where a minor loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. The other data category is input into the second discriminator, where a larger loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. Through this process, the model can effectively constrain the generator, retaining information on normal data during data reconstruction while discarding information on abnormal data. After conducting experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure achieved good results in anomaly detection, outperforming several advanced methods. Additionally, the model also performed well in practical transformer data.},

This framework integrates the model predictive control (MPC) and offline reinforcement learning (RL) under assumptions of a linear Markov decision process (MDP) with the Koopman operator. KLMOP introduces a fully linearized control framework by learning and modeling the dynamics, reward function, and value function in a latent space through a Koopman-based latent dynamical model (KLDM) and a pessimistic value iteration (PEVI) algorithm. This formulation builds upon the connection between Koopman operator theory and linear MDP. Contrastive learning is employed to ensure the expressiveness and structural conditions of the latent representation in linear MDP, enabling accurate reward prediction and efficient policy optimization. The MPC-based planning policy, then, leverages these components to solve a linear MPC problem efficiently in the latent space. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that KLMOP significantly improves computational efficiency and control performance as compared with existing baseline methods for RM control. This framework provides a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient approach to linearizing nonlinear control problems, and its learning-based design makes it adaptable to broader applications.},

Specifically, ERA employs a multibranched residual network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition. Additionally, a teacher weight integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher’s head weights. Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.},

Observations show that long-tail bias in the data stream has a cascading effect, affecting the retention of old task knowledge and learning new tasks. Concurrently, the incremental model encounters challenges in identifying samples that conflict with its biases. Accordingly, we propose a CFD method called long-tail CIL via bias calibration (LTCIL-BC), which aims to improve the learning of bias-conflicting samples through bias exploration and debiasing. Specifically, LTCIL-BC simultaneously trains a primary debiased network and an auxiliary biased network. Then, a bias-indicating score is developed to provide insight into model bias and data bias based on the prediction error of the primary and auxiliary models, respectively. LTCIL-BC subsequently adjusts the logits of the debiased network using the bias-indicating score to guide optimization, thereby better utilizing the role of old class exemplars and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on power system (PS) and secure water treatment (SWaT) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LTCIL-BC in CFD, achieving up to 9% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multiple long-tailed CIL setting. Comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTCIL-BC in jointly addressing data and model bias during calibration and prioritizing bias-conflicting samples.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we first tackle a more realistic domain adaptation (DA) setting: source-free blending-target DA (SF-BTDA), where we cannot access to source-domain data while facing mixed multiple target domains without any domain labels in prior. Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the coexistence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudolabels generated from the source model. In this article, we propose a new method called evidential graph contrastive alignment (EGCA) to decouple the blending-target domain and alleviate the effect of noisy target pseudolabels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning (CEL) module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of the same class in the blending-target domain, which alleviates the coexistence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets, and EGCA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.},

  abstract     = {In industrial scenarios, semantic segmentation of surface defects is vital for identifying, localizing, and delineating defects. However, new defect types constantly emerge with product iterations or process updates. Existing defect segmentation models lack incremental learning capabilities, and direct fine-tuning (FT) often leads to catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, low contrast between defects and background, as well as among defect classes, exacerbates this issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a plug-and-play Transformer-based semantic complement module (TSCM). With only a few added parameters, it injects global contextual features from multi-head self-attention into shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps, compensating for convolutional receptive-field limits and fusing global and local information for better segmentation. For incremental updates, we propose multi-scale spatial pooling distillation (MSPD), which uses pseudo-labeling and multi-scale pooling to preserve both short- and long-range spatial relations and provides smooth feature alignment between teacher and student. Additionally, we adopt an adaptive weight fusion (AWF) strategy with a dynamic threshold that assigns higher weights to parameters with larger updates, achieving an optimal balance between stability and plasticity. The experimental results on two industrial surface defect datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in various incremental segmentation scenarios.},

However, existing methods often rely on additional heavy trainable modules, such as transformer or BiLSTM, which are inefficient. In contrast, we avoid introducing such heavy components by leveraging frozen foundation models. To this end, we propose temporal modeling with frozen vision–language foundation models (TFVL) to model the temporal dynamics with fixed encoders. Specifically, text encoder temporal modeling (TextTemp) and image encoder temporal modeling (ImageTemp) apply frozen text and image encoders within the video head and video backbone, respectively. TextTemp uses a frozen text encoder to interpret frame representations as “visual words” within a temporal “sentence,” capturing temporal dependencies. On the other hand, ImageTemp uses a frozen image encoder to treat all frame tokens as a unified visual entity, learning spatiotemporal information. The total trainable parameters of our method, comprising a lightweight projection and several prompt tokens, are significantly fewer than those in other existing methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, ActivityNet, and LSMDC. Compared with full fine-tuning on MSR-VTT, our TFVL achieves an average 3.25% gain in R@1 with merely 0.35% of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TFVL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer parameters.},

To address this issue, we recast data imputation as a distribution alignment challenge, utilizing the flexibility of optimal transport (OT) to handle noisy samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Proximal Optimal Transport (POT) problem, where the transportation cost is obtained by the network simplex approach with a selective matching mechanism, which renders it capable of matching distributions with noisy samples. Subsequently, we propose the POT-I framework, where the objective is to minimize the transport cost of POT. The produced gradient is used to refine the imputation value, which achieves missing data imputation (MDI) while getting robustness to noisy samples. Experiments on real-world IIoT datasets demonstrate the superiority of POT-I over state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

In this article, we derive a general trust region for policy optimization methods by considering the effect of subpolicy combinations among agents in multiagent environments. Based on this trust region, we propose an inductive objective to train the policy function, which can ensure agents learn monotonically improving policies. Furthermore, we observe that the policy always updates very weakly before falling into a local optimum. To address this, we introduce a cost regarding policy distance in the inductive objective to strengthen the motivation of agents to explore new policies. This approach strikes a balance during training, where the policy update step size remains within the constraints of the trust region, preventing excessive updates while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. Simulations on wind farm (WF) control tasks and two multiagent benchmarks demonstrate the high performance of the proposed multiagent inductive policy optimization (MAIPO) method.},

  abstract     = {In essence, reinforcement learning (RL) solves optimal control problem (OCP) by employing a neural network (NN) to fit the optimal policy from state to action. The accuracy of policy approximation is often very low in complex control tasks, leading to unsatisfactory control performance compared with online optimal controllers. A primary reason is that the landscape of value function is always not only rugged in most areas but also flat on the bottom, which damages the convergence to the minimum point. To address this issue, we develop a bicriteria policy optimization (BPO) algorithm, which leverages a few optimal demonstration trajectories to guide the policy search at the gradient level. Different from conventional problem definition, BPO seeks to solve a bicriteria OCP, which has two homomorphic objectives: one is from the standard reward signals and the other is to align the demonstration trajectories. We introduce two co-state variables, one for each objectives, and formulate two Hamiltonians for this bicriteria OCP. The resulting new optimality condition preserves the minimum values of both Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that gradient conflict is a key obstacle to simultaneously descending both Hamiltonians, and its impact is negatively proportional to the inner product between the ideal and actual gradients. A minimax optimization problem is built at each RL iteration to minimize conflicts between two homomorphic objectives, whose solution for policy updating is referred to as harmonic gradient. By converting its inner optimization loop into a linear programming with convex trust region constraint, we simplify this problem into a single-loop maximization problem with much increased computational efficiency. Experiment tests on both linear and nonlinear control tasks validate the effectiveness of our BPO algorithm on the accuracy improvement of policy network.},

Previous methods utilize intramodality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo-labels might be generated in the clustering process and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from the two modalities. In this article, we first conduct a theoretical analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person reidentification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction (PLC) strategy that utilizes a beta mixture model (BMM) to predict the probability of misclustering-based network’s memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment (MLA) strategy that generates paired visible–infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity-discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.},

This article proposes a novel approach to enable agents to autonomously decide whether their behaviors should align with those of their peers by leveraging intrinsic rewards to optimize their policies. We define behavior consistency as the divergence between the actions taken by two agents given the same observations. To encourage agents to be aware of each other’s behaviors, we propose dynamic consistency-based intrinsic reward (DCIR), which guides agents in determining when to synchronize their behaviors. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scaling network (DSN) that provides learnable scaling factors at each time step, enabling agents to dynamically decide the extent of rewarding consistent behavior.

Second, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as ”implicit feedback”). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items that users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which, to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for autoencoders in a Recommender systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.},

However, representative studies only evaluated SNNs on static temporal tasks or short sequence tasks, which could not fully demonstrate the advantages of SNNs in spatiotemporal learning. In addition, we point out that the existing directly trained SNNs to face the problems of long-term memory, network degeneration, gradient saturation, and heterogeneity learning, these limit the performance of SNNs. In this article, we propose channelwise regional integrate and multiple firing (CRIMF) neuron to improve the spatiotemporal learning of SNNs. First, CRIMF neuron contains a new internal state of regional current that enhances the memory of spiking neurons and facilitates the learning of temporal information over long time steps. Second, CRIMF neuron is implemented with the multiple firing mechanisms; it is able to adjust the distribution of membrane potential and membrane potential gradient in the single firing mechanism, thus mitigating the underactivation and gradient saturation. Third, CRIMF neuron is trained with the channelwise learning strategy for the targeted learning of different types of temporal features, and an index of differentiation degree is proposed to visualize the effectiveness of the channelwise learning strategy. We also introduce the regional current reset equation and normalize the input of postsynaptic neurons in spatiotemporal dimension to avoid network degeneration. Finally, we select two emotion electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and perform the evaluations based on manual features and raw signals. Experimental results show that CRIMF-based SNNs outperform the state-of-the-art methods in static temporal task, and CRIMF neurons are superior to the advanced spiking neurons and recurrent units of ANNs in dynamic temporal task, using low energy consumption.},

Integrating these interfaces with computer vision techniques, which possess efficient feature extraction capabilities, can achieve more robust and accurate detection of dim targets in aerial images. However, existing target detection methods primarily concentrate on homogeneous data, lacking efficient and versatile processing capabilities for heterogeneous multimodal data. In this article, we first build a brain–eye–computer-based object detection system for aerial images under few-shot conditions. This system detects suspicious targets using region proposal networks (RPNs), evokes the event-related potential (ERP) signal in electroencephalogram (EEG) through the eye-tracking-based slow serial visual presentation (ESSVP) paradigm, and constructs the EEG–image data pairs with eye movement data. Then, an adaptive modality balanced online knowledge distillation (AMBOKD) method is proposed to recognize dim objects with the EEG–image data. AMBOKD fuses EEG and image features using a multihead attention module, establishing a new modality with comprehensive features. To enhance the performance and robust capability of the fusion modality, simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities are enabled by end-to-end online KD (OKD). During the learning process, an adaptive modality balancing module is proposed to ensure multimodal equilibrium by dynamically adjusting the weights of the importance and the training gradients across various modalities. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are demonstrated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, experiments conducted on public datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate the reliability and practicality of the proposed system and the designed method.

  abstract     = {Despite the strong performance of transformers, quadratic computation complexity of self-attention presents challenges in applying them to vision tasks. Linear attention reduces this complexity from quadratic to linear, offering a strong computation–performance tradeoff. To further optimize this, automatic pruning is an effective method to find a structure that maximizes performance within a target resource through training without any heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multihead attention is not straightforward due to channel mismatch. In this article, we propose an automatic pruning method to deal with this problem. Different from existing methods that rely solely on training without any prior knowledge, we integrate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve the more informative channels within each head. Then, we adjust the pruning indicator to enforce that channels are removed evenly across all heads, thereby avoiding any channel mismatch. We incorporate a reweight module to mitigate information loss due to channel removal and introduce an effective pruning indicator initialization for linear attention, based on the attention differences between the original structure and each channel. By applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer on ImageNet-1K, which incorporates original and linear attention mechanisms, we achieve a 30% reduction of FLOPs in a near lossless manner. It also has 1.96% of accuracy gain over the DeiT-B model while reducing FLOPs by 37%, and 1.05% accuracy increase over the Swin-B model with a 10% reduction in FLOPs as well. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art efficient models and the recent pruning methods.},

  abstract     = {Computing matrix gradient has become a key aspect in modern signal processing/machine learning, with the recent use of matrix neural networks requiring matrix backpropagation. In this field, two main methods exist to calculate the gradient of matrix functions for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, namely, the Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia formula and the Ionescu method. However, there appear to be a few errors. This brief aims to demonstrate each of these formulas in a self-contained and unified framework, to prove theoretically their equivalence, and to clarify inaccurate results of the literature. A numerical comparison of both methods is also provided in terms of computational speed and numerical stability to show the superiority of the Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia approach. We also extend the matrix gradient to the general case of diagonalizable matrices. Convincing results with the two backpropagation methods are shown on the EEG-based BCI competition dataset with the implementation of an SPDNet, yielding around 80% accuracy for one subject. Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia formula achieves an 8% time gain during training and handles degenerate cases.},

  abstract     = {This article advances the theoretical foundations of stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) by rigorously analyzing their convergence properties, approximation guarantees, and the limitations of nonadaptive randomized methods. We introduce a principled objective function that aligns incremental training with orthogonal projection, ensuring maximal residual reduction at each iteration without recomputing output weights. Under this formulation, we derive a novel necessary and sufficient condition for strong convergence in Hilbert spaces and establish sufficient conditions for uniform geometric convergence, offering the first theoretical justification of the SCN residual constraint. To assess the feasibility of unguided random initialization, we present a probabilistic analysis showing that even small support shifts markedly reduce the likelihood of sampling effective nodes in high-dimensional settings, thereby highlighting the necessity of adaptive refinement in the sampling distribution. Motivated by these insights, we propose greedy SCNs (GSCNs) and two optimized variants—Newton–Raphson GSCN (NR-GSCN) and particle swarm optimization GSCN (PSO-GSCN)—that incorporate Newton–Raphson refinement and particle swarm-based exploration to improve node selection. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve faster convergence, better approximation accuracy, and more compact architectures compared to existing SCN training schemes. Collectively, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical and algorithmic framework for SCNs, laying out a principled foundation for subsequent developments in the field of randomized neural network (NN) training.},

For complex data involving spatiotemporal interactions, MF that only handles 2-D data will disrupt spatial dependence or temporal dynamics, failing to effectively couple spatial information with temporal factors. According to Markov chain principle, the spatial information of the present time is related to the spatial state of the previous time. We propose a spatial–temporal diffusion model for MF (STDMF), which uses graph diffusion to couple spatial–temporal information. Then, MF is used to learn the joint feature of data and spatial–temporal diffusion graph. Specifically, STDMF utilizes the graph diffusion with physical laws to generate spatial–temporal structure information. It obtains the underlying core structure of complex systems from a global perspective, which enhances the generalization ability of MF in noisy time-series data. To learn the lowest rank subspace of MF in time-series data, STDMF uses structural learning to constrain the rank of the learned features. Finally, STDMF is applied to clustering and anomaly detection of dynamic graph. The effectiveness of this method is verified by sufficient experiments, especially for noisy data.},

However, in real-world applications, such as robotic control of reinforcement learning (RL), the tasks are changing, and new tasks arise in a sequential order. This situation poses the new challenge of plasticity–stability tradeoff for training an agent who can adapt to task changes and retain acquired knowledge. In view of this, we propose a rehearsal-based continual diffusion model, called continual diffuser (CoD), to endow the diffuser with the capabilities of quick adaptation (plasticity) and lasting retention (stability). Specifically, we first construct an offline benchmark that contains 90 tasks from multiple domains. Then, we train the CoD on each task with sequential modeling and conditional generation for making decisions. Next, we preserve a small portion of previous datasets as the rehearsal buffer and replay it to retain the acquired knowledge. Extensive experiments on a series of tasks show that CoD can achieve a promising plasticity–stability tradeoff and outperform existing diffusion-based methods and other representative baselines on most tasks.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models, as a class of generative frameworks based on step-wise denoising, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of medical image segmentation. However, existing diffusion-based methods typically rely on static fusion strategies to integrate conditional priors with denoised features, making them difficult to adaptively balance their respective contributions at different denoising stages. Moreover, these methods often lack explicit modeling of pixel-level uncertainty in ambiguous regions, which may lead to the loss of structural details during the iterative denoising process, ultimately compromising the accuracy (Acc) and completeness of the final segmentation results. To this end, we propose FEU-Diff, a diffusion-based segmentation framework that integrates fuzzy evidence modeling and uncertainty fusion (UF) mechanisms. Specifically, a fuzzy semantic enhancement (FSE) module is designed to model pixel-level uncertainty through Gaussian membership functions and fuzzy logic rules, enhancing the model’s ability to identify and represent ambiguous boundaries. An evidence dynamic fusion (EDF) module estimates feature confidence via a Dirichlet-based distribution and adaptively guides the fusion of conditional information and denoised features across different denoising stages. Furthermore, the UF module quantifies discrepancies among multisource predictions to compensate for structural detail loss during the iterative denoising process. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that FEU-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving an average gain of 1.42% in the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 1.47% in intersection over union (IoU), and a 2.26 mm reduction in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). In addition, our method generates uncertainty maps that enhance clinical interpretability.},

Herein, the peak-padding clustering algorithm (PeakPad)—clustering by padding density peaks with the minimum padding cost—is proposed. PeakPad executes clustering on the density surface and views complex-shaped clusters as combinations of highly associated single-peak clusters. The minimum padding cost that fully considers the surrounding context of a density peak is proposed to reflect a density peak’s center potential, enabling PeakPad to have robust center detection performance. Unlike mean-shift (MSC), which detects centers based on their attributes in a complex-shaped density surface embedded in the high-dimensional space of density and features, PeakPad detects centers in a standard-shaped surface embedded in the 2-D density-change (DC) density space (composed of density and DC feature). Such standardization allows PeakPad to have fast and robust cluster center detection performance on complex-shaped clusters based on the minimum padding cost. Besides, PeakPad can provide a reasonable evaluation of the association between single-peak clusters by using the minimum padding cost. As a result, PeakPad can fast capture complex-shaped clusters, achieve robust center detection performance, and be suitable for large datasets. Benchmark test results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PeakPad.},

In order to bridge this gap, we present unsupervised-semi-supervised stacking (USemiS), a novel framework that synergizes semi-supervised learning with ensemble meta-learning. USemiS introduces three core innovations: 1) unsupervised component learners that extract low-level representations of heterogeneous anomalies, 2) a consensus-based tuning mechanism that dynamically weights robust learners via stability metrics, and 3) spatiotemporal MixUp (ST-MixUp), a tailored augmentation strategy that interpolates anomalies across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance decision boundaries. By integrating these components, USemiS effectively disentangles latent anomaly patterns while mitigating label scarcity. Evaluated on large-scale traffic anomaly and crowd fall detection datasets, USemiS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 1.3% and 2.1% in AUC under extreme low-label regimes (0.4% and 0.8% labeled data, respectively). These results underscore USemiS’s capacity to generalize across diverse spatiotemporal contexts, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world applications where labeled anomalies are scarce yet critical.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the action-region tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling distinguishing similar actions effectively. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics serve as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are then organized into action tracklets, which characterize the region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across different video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries are designed to expressly encode nuanced semantic representations derived from the textual descriptions of action labels, as extracted by the language branches within visual language models. To optimize generated action tracklets, we design a multilevel tracklet contrastive constraint among multiple region responses at spatial and temporal levels, which can effectively distinguish individual region responses in each video frame (spatial level) and establish the correlation of similar region responses between adjacent video frames (temporal level). In addition, we implement a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism to refine textual semantics during training. This ensures that the semantic representations encoded by vision language models (VLMs) are not only preserved but also optimized for specific task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on several widely used action recognition benchmarks, i.e., FineGym, Diving48, NTURGB-D, Kinetics, and Something-Something, clearly demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

To address this shortcoming, we introduce a new federated learning model for graph anomaly detection (FedGAD). FedGAD enables collaborative unsupervised learning among decentralized data centers without requiring direct access to the distributed subgraphs. Specifically, FedGAD masks and reconstructs the neighborhood features to enhance the knowledge of node representations. Considering the data diversity across distributed clients, we also design a cross-clients’ node representation module that enables nodes to reconstruct neighbors by leveraging information from other clients. Furthermore, we use a multiscale contrastive learning function, which includes both structure-level and contextual-level learning functions, to detect graph anomalies in the condition that subgraphs located at different clients show imbalanced data distributions. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedGAD compared with baseline methods, verifying its capability of improving GAD performance.},

This joint factorization not only reduces the number of parameters but also lowers computational complexity by eliminating redundant computations. To further improve efficiency, we first cluster the filters before decomposition. The grouping relies on a custom metric based on the subspace spanned by the shared-mode factor.

However, this feature also magnifies the complexity of their bodies, rendering their proprioception, and hence their control, extremely challenging. Given this intricacy, machine learning is a potent candidate for extracting proprioceptive insights from sensor data due to its proven capabilities in tackling analogous issues in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Recently, key aspects of soft robot proprioception have been addressed via learning-based techniques, but most of these are rooted in the supervised learning (SL) paradigm. This typically requires collecting a large number of costly annotated training samples, thereby constraining its widespread and speedy adoption in real-world applications. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a self-SL framework for soft robot proprioception. Our method utilizes vast unannotated data for network pretraining by self-SL. Then, the pretrained model is fine-tuned with a limited set of annotated samples by SL. We validate the proposed method’s efficacy on a high-resolution 3-D morphological reconstruction task using a publicly available dataset. Remarkably, our approach is shown to necessitate only about 1/20 of annotated samples to achieve better performance than the fully supervised method.},

In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. In particular, based on the latest SSMs, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs toward efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may be capable of surpassing Transformer. Recently, a number of works attempt to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multimodal learning, medical image analysis, and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba’s application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances, and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.},

  abstract     = {This article pioneers the study of boundary-optimized fault-tolerant tracking control for flexible manipulators in a switching digraph with a heterogeneous linear leader. Compared with existing research, the proposed methods have several features. First, a distributed observer is designed to observe the leader’s information in a general switching graph where communication can be interrupted. Second, a new partial differential equation (PDE)-based fault observer (FO) is designed to estimate unknown faults using only a few boundary states. Third, a novel long-term integral cost function is formulated to minimize angle-tracking errors, vibration deflections, and control energy in flexible manipulators. The ideal boundary optimal control laws are, then, derived and approximated using actor–critic neural networks (NNs) based on reinforcement learning (RL). Under the proposed fully distributed optimized fault-tolerant controllers, the closed-loop flexible manipulator’s error states are proven uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Recently, domain alignment and metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) have been introduced into hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) to solve the issues of uneven data distribution and scarcity of annotated data faced in practical applications. However, existing cross-domain few-shot methods ignore pivotal frequency priors of the complex field, which contribute to better category discrimination and knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we propose a novel physics-guided time-interactive-frequency network (PTFNet) for cross-domain few-shot HSIC, enabling the extraction of both frequency priors and spatial features (termed “time domain” following Fourier convention) simultaneously through a lightweight time-interactive-frequency module (TiF-Module) as a pioneering effort. Meanwhile, a spectral Fourier-based augmentation module (SFA-Module) is designed to decouple the frequency priors and enhance the diversity of distribution of physical attributes to imitate the domain shift. Then, the physics consistency loss is introduced to regularize the diverse embeddings to approximate the center of each category’s physical attributes, guiding the network to excavate more transferable knowledge of source domain (SD). Furthermore, to fully exploit the discriminant time–frequency information and further improve the accuracy of boundary pixels, a set of multiorientation homogeneous prototypes is adopted to represent each class comprehensively, and an intuitive and flexible uncertainty-rectified bidirectional random walk strategy is applied to replace the Euclidean metric for more reliable classification. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the prominent performance of the proposed PTFNet.},

However, existing methods lack task-specific guidance, leading to limitations in fully capturing the complex dynamics and invariant representations in time series data. Motivated by the auxiliary tasks in multitask learning (MTL) and to fully utilize the rich frequency-domain information of time series data, we propose a novel time series classification framework, uncertainty-based time–frequency supervised CL (U-TFSCL). This framework uses SCL in the time and frequency domains and time–frequency consistency as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of using only instance-level labels for time series classification. Furthermore, inspired by the homogeneous uncertainty in MTL, we derive a novel uncertainty loss function, which automatically adjusts the weights according to the degree of uncertainty of different tasks to optimize the learning and prediction process of the model. The proposed framework is evaluated on MTSC tasks, including human activity recognition (HAR), air writing, and gesture recognition. In addition, we create a human–drone interaction (HDI) dataset consisting of 20 subjects and conduct real-world experiments to evaluate the proposed framework. The extensive experiments conducted in various settings verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

This article proposes a multimodal quaternion representation network (MMQRN) for multisource remote sensing (RS) data classification. Specifically, we first propose the multimodal quaternion representation (MMQR), which employs the orthogonal imaginary components of quaternions to model the complex nonlinear interactions among complementary features, thereby enabling their comprehensive fusion and utilization. Subsequently, we design a multimodal feature cross-fusion (MFCF) framework to integrate multisource, multimodal, and multilevel features adequately. Finally, we leverage the ability to capture long-term dependencies of transformers to design a quaternion convolutional transformer network (QCTN) for modeling global and local spatial–spectral information, respectively. Experiments conducted on three multisource RS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMQRN relative to other state-of-the-art classification methods.},

Particularly, a novel data preprocessing (DP) method is proposed to obtain ground truth (GT) with specific structural integrity, guiding the network to learn close-distance structural information. In addition, the proposed consistency constraint displacement module (CCDM) is employed to fulfill structure growth, and a feature memory module (FMM) further enhances the quality of the grown structure.

  abstract     = {Representation learning is a key area in machine learning and deep learning, focusing on extracting meaningful features to support downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Current mainstream representation learning methods primarily rely on nonlinear data mining techniques such as kernel methods and deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract abstract knowledge from complex datasets. However, most of them are “black-box” methods, lacking transparency and interpretability in the learning process, which constrain their practical utility. To this end, this article introduces a novel representation learning method called fuzzy rule-based differentiable representation learning (FRDRL), which is grounded in an interpretable fuzzy rule-based model. Specifically, it is built upon the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) to map input data to a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space through the antecedent part of the TSK-FS. Subsequently, a novel differentiable optimization method is proposed for learning in the consequent part, which preserves interpretability and transparency while effectively capturing nonlinear relationships in the data. By retaining the essence of traditional optimization and parameterizing key components as differentiable modules, the method improves performance without sacrificing interpretability. Moreover, a second-order geometry preservation strategy is incorporated to further improve robustness. Extensive evaluations conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method. The source codes are available at https://github.com/BBKing49/FEDRL},

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely applied in various domains. Current widely-used optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, and their variants, are designed based on the assumption that the gradient noise generated during model training follows a Gaussian distribution. However, recent empirical studies have found that the gradient noise often does not follow a Gaussian distribution. Instead, the noise exhibits heavy-tailed characteristics consistent with an $\alpha $ -stable distribution, casting doubt on the performance and robustness of optimizers designed under the assumption of Gaussian noise. Inspired by the least mean p-power (LMP) algorithm from the field of adaptive filtering, we propose a novel optimizer called Ape for deep learning. Ape integrates a p-power adjustment mechanism to compress large gradients and amplify small ones, mitigating the impact of heavy-tailed gradient distributions. It also employs an approach for estimating second moments tailored to $\alpha $ -stable distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate Ape’s effectiveness in improving both accuracy and training speed compared to existing optimizers. The Ape optimizer showcases the potential of cross-disciplinary approaches in advancing deep learning optimization techniques and lays the groundwork for future innovations in this domain.},

This study introduces the bionic hierarchical learning network (BHL-Net) to enhance power consumption predictions. Leveraging 2-D frequency preprocessing and brain visual modeling techniques, BHL-Net mimics natural image encoding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to improve predictive performance. It incorporates a temporal oscillation activation module and a stripe intensity attention module to focus on local features, while a multihead attention adaptive aggregation module identifies key global features. Comparative experiments show that BHL-Net outperforms existing transformer-based models for MEX power consumption prediction. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the FFT-based 2-D transformation and bionic attention framework. By emulating human brain response coding mechanisms, BHL-Net captures variations within and between complex cycles, providing a competitive solution for time series prediction in industrial applications.},

Prior research primarily focuses on intradomain transfer, overlooking the complexities of transferring knowledge across tasks with differing state and action spaces. Recent efforts in cross-domain TRL aim to bridge this gap by establishing mappings between disparate source and target spaces, thereby enabling knowledge transfer across RL tasks with varied state and action configurations. However, existing studies often rely on strict prior assumptions about the relationships between state spaces, which limits their practical generality. In this article, we propose a novel approach to cross-domain TRL based on seeded graph matching, which enables alignment between source and target tasks regardless of differences in their state–action spaces. In particular, we model RL tasks as directed graphs, identify seed node pairs based on common RL properties, and devise a graph matching algorithm to align the source and target tasks by leveraging their structural characteristics. Building on this alignment, we introduce a policy-based transfer algorithm that improves the performance of the target RL task as its RL process progresses. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies on both discrete and continuous tasks with diverse state–action spaces.
