  abstract     = {It is often required that identified models exhibit certain stability and dissipativity properties, e.g., passivity or $\ell _{2}$-gain. The aim of this paper is to develop an unconstrained parametrization of linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output (IO) discrete-time (DT) models that guarantees stability/dissipativity by construction, i.e., the model is stable/dissipative for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that any quadratically stable/dissipative DT-LPV-IO model can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball. The unit ball is reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in a fully unconstrained parameterization. These results immediately apply to linear time-varying IO models. In the linear time-invariant case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable/dissipative DT transfer functions is obtained. The unconstrained parametrization enables, among others, the use of neural network coefficient functions in LPV system identification while guaranteeing stability and dissipativity.},

The underpinning of the definition lies in the matrix segmental phase which, as its name implies, is graphically based on the smallest circular segment covering the matrix normalized numerical range in the unit disk. The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.},

Sensitive information that could reveal the payoff functions is referred to as the privacy of agents. In the proposed approach, at least half of the agents (named as nonessential agents) can provide some nonsensitive information in addition to their state values, enabling the system manager to influence agents' dynamical decisions by imposing taxes or offering subsidies with a sustainable budget constraint. To protect the privacy of all agents, our approach shifts the stationary points of the nonessential agents and hence indirectly moves the Nash equilibrium of the entire system. By constructing the additional nonsensitive information from nonessential agents as the time-wise information of stationary-point mappings related to certain secret matrices, sufficient conditions are derived where the Nash equilibrium is shifted towards the target state achieving Pareto efficiency under the incentive mechanism. We also provide some stability conditions to ensure that agents' state converges to the target state under a sustainable budget for the given initial state. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficacy of our results.},

Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the distributed aggregative optimization challenge in uncertain multiple Euler- Lagrange (EL) systems, where each EL agent's local objective function depends on its own position and the aggregation of all EL agents' positions. The goal is to control all EL agents to reach their optimal positions as defined by the aggregative optimization problem. Two distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are proposed for uncertain EL systems, which are based on distinct optimization-control strategies, namely the open-loop optimization-control strategy and the closed-loop optimization-control strategy. To address the model uncertainty in EL systems, an auxiliary second-order system is introduced, integrating with adaptive compensation and tracking techniques to mitigate the uncertainty. Given the unique structure of the aggregative optimization problem, two distributed estimation protocols are developed for handling the aggregation terms in the optimization problem. Specifically, in the open-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient is derived from the position information of the auxiliary system; whereas, in the closed-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient relies on the real-time position of the EL system. The convergence of both algorithms is rigorously proved. Unlike existing studies that mainly concentrate on distributed optimization algorithms based on either open-loop or closed-loop strategies, this paper is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of open-loop and closed-loop optimization-control strategies, with a special emphasis on the robustness of the closed-loop strategy in counteracting external disturbances and variations. Finally, the proposed distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are applied to the optimal localization problem of networked marine vehicles with parameter uncertainties. Comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the distributed optimization problem in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noises. Here, a heavy-tailed noise $\xi$ does not necessarily adhere to the bounded variance assumption, i.e., $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^{2}]\leq \nu ^{2}$ for some positive constant $\nu$. Instead, it satisfies a more general condition $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^\delta ]\leq \nu ^\delta$ for some $1&lt; \delta \leq 2$. The commonly-used bounded variance assumption is a special case of the considered noise assumption. While several distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed for scenarios involving heavy-tailed noise, these algorithms need a centralized server in the network which collects the information of all clients. Different from these algorithms, this paper considers a scenario where there is no centralized server and the agents can only exchange information with neighbors within a communication graph. A distributed method combining gradient clipping and distributed stochastic gradient projection is proposed. It is proven that when the gradient descent step-size and the gradient clipping step-size meet certain conditions, the state of each agent converges to an optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem with probability 1. The simulation results validate the algorithm.},

Additionally, we present conditions to ensure that the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space contains only functions which are bona fide moments. While exact moment matching with finite data is impractical in this scenario, we introduce the concepts of weak moment matching and moment matching almost everywhere onto the $\mathcal {L}_{2}$-space. Additionally, we address scenarios in which the dataset contains noisy measurements of outputs that are not yet in a steady-state, which typically biases the estimation due to the effect of the output transients. We further prove that estimating over a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space can ensure weak moment matching asymptotically and, with additional assumptions, also moment matching almost everywhere despite these transients. Finally, we provide a probabilistic bound that guarantees weak moment matching for an arbitrarily finite amount of data.},

Solving this problem is equivalent to addressing a discounted Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) partial differential equation. In this paper, we first establish a precise estimate for the discount factor $\alpha$ that guarantees the existence of a nonnegative stabilizing solution to the discounted HJI equation. This stabilizing solution corresponds to the stable manifold of the characteristic system associated with the discounted HJI equation, which is a contact Hamiltonian system due to the discount factor. Secondly, we demonstrate that a natural approximation of the optimal controller yields a closed-loop system whose $L_{2}$-gain is arbitrarily close to that of the original system. Thirdly, based on these theoretical results, we propose a deep learning algorithm to compute an approximate optimal controller by utilizing the stable manifold of the contact Hamiltonian system derived from the HJI equation. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we give two examples: $H_{\infty }$ control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and $H_{\infty }$ control of the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation.},

This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.},

  abstract     = {Some recent papers have extended the concept of finite-time stability (FTS) to the context of 2D linear systems, where it has been referred to as finite-region stability (FRS). FRS methodologies make even more sense than the classical FTS approach developed for 1D-systems, since, typically, at least one of the state variables of 2D-systems is a space coordinate, rather than a time variable. Since space coordinates clearly belong to finite intervals, FRS techniques are much more effective than the classical Lyapunov approach, which looks to the asymptotic behavior of the system over an infinite interval. To this regard, the novel contribution of this paper goes in several directions. First, we provide a novel sufficient condition for the FRS of linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time 2D-systems, which turns out to be less conservative than those provided in the existing literature. Then, an interesting application of FRS to the context of iterative learning control (ILC) is investigated, by exploiting the previously developed theory. In particular, a new procedure is proposed so that the tracking errors of the ILC law converges within the desired bound in a finite number of iterations. Finally, a sufficient condition to solve the finite-region stabilization problem is proposed. All the results provided in the paper lead to optimization problems constrained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that can be solved via widely available software. Numerical examples illustrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and develop the concept of dispersion formation control, bridging a gap between shape-assembly studies in physics and biology and formation control theory. In current formation control studies, the control objectives typically focus on achieving desired local geometric properties, such as inter-agent distances, bearings, or relative positions. In contrast, our dispersion formation control approach enables agents to directly regulate the dispersion of their spatial distribution, a global variable associated with a covariance matrix. Specifically, we introduce the notion of covariance similarity to define the target spatial dispersion of agents. Building on this framework, we propose two control strategies: a centralized approach to illustrate the key ideas, and a distributed approach that enables agents to control the global dispersion but using only local information. Our stability analysis demonstrates that both strategies ensure exponential convergence of the agents' distribution to the desired dispersion. Notably, controlling a global variable rather than multiple local ones enhances the resiliency of the system, particularly against malfunctioning agents. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed dispersion formation control.},

  abstract     = {We introduce FlipDyn with control, a finite-horizon zero-sum resource takeover game, where a defender and an adversary decide when to takeover and how to control a common resource. At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete FlipDyn state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the FlipDyn game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.},

A distributed two-layer optimal safe consensus protocol is proposed using the extended projection method, which simultaneously ensures safety requirements and optimal output consensus. Specifically, we construct a distributed projection optimization algorithm with an expanding constraint set in the decision-making layer, while proposing a reference-tracking safety controller to ensure that each agent's output remains within a shrinking safety set in the control layer. We also establish the convergence and safety analysis of the closed-loop system using the small-gain theorem and time-varying control barrier function (CBF) theory, respectively. By these approaches, we reach exactly an optimal solution, where the optimization part may drive the outputs of the system to the boundary of the constraints, and the safety part can avoid approaching the boundary.},

Thus, a common strategy is to transform the nonlinear system into a linear one through a change of coordinates and feedback-a technique known as feedback linearization. Here we consider the feedback linearization problem of an unknown system when the solution must be found using experimental data. We propose a new method that learns the change of coordinates and the linearizing controller from a library (a dictionary) of candidate functions with a simple algebraic procedure â the computation of the null space of a data-dependent matrix. Remarkably, we show that the solution is valid over the entire state space of interest and not just on the dataset used to determine the solution.},

Compared with the existing work, the uncertainties for both the controlled system and the actuator systems, as well as the disturbances for actuator systems, are all taken into consideration. To solve the problem, we develop a dynamic output feedback controller based on the internal model principle. First, a general framework for solving the cooperative robust parallel operation problem is established. By establishing some technical lemmas, we reveal the relationship between the system input sharing of actuators and the robust output regulation property. Then, for different network conditions, we propose the gain matrix design methods in terms of the network connectivity property and the system matrix of the dynamic controller. It guarantees the solvability of the regulator equations and the stability property of the system matrix associated with the closed-loop system. Resorting to the internal model principle, we show that the cooperative robust parallel operation problem can be solved in spite of system uncertainties and disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed internal model approach is verified by its application to a shaft driven control with fifteen electric actuator motors.},

First, within the framework of the periodic delayed feedback approach, two novel super-twisting algorithms are proposed, whose settling times are bounded by a constant independent of the initial conditions and can be arbitrarily prescribed. Next, for a class of high-order uncertain nonlinear systems, a novel disturbance observer and a prescribed-time continuous sliding mode control law are designed based on the first super-twisting algorithm. Furthermore, for a class of perturbed double integrator systems, a novel state observer and a prescribed-time continuous sliding mode control law by output feedback are designed based on the second super-twisting algorithm. Unlike the widely used time-varying high-gain feedback approach in the literature, the control laws designed in this paper ensure that the system output converges to zero with the settling time being exactly equal to the prescribed time, even in the presence of both matched and mismatched disturbances, while mitigating sensitivity to measurement noise and avoiding the singularity issues caused by infinite gain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through simulations.},

Then, some analytical expressions of optimal tracking and regulation performance are derived using frequency-domain analysis and two-degree-of-freedom (TDOF) control techniques. The results demonstrate that the tracking and regulation performance of NCSs is influenced by the locations and directions of the NMPZs and UPs of the plant, network-induced time delays, quantization dead zones, and quantization densities. Finally, the validity of the conclusions drawn in this study is confirmed through simulation examples.},

The existing mean-subsequence-reduced-based algorithms rely on dimension-wise ordering to resist Byzantine attacks, leading to poor scalability in high-dimensional systems. To overcome this issue, the signum operator and absolute value function are employed to decouple the high-dimensional attack characteristics, based on which a norm-based max-discard mechanism (NMDM) is proposed to isolate location-varying Byzantine attacks. Building upon this foundation, a resilient distributed state estimation algorithm integrated with NMDM is developed to achieve consensus estimation of high-dimensional vectors, irrelevant to the switching frequency of attack locations.

We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off.

The reachability of tracking errors is then analyzed using set propagation techniques. The convergence of the reachable sets to a bounded invariant set is proved. A parameterized optimal trajectory is obtained by solving a linear quadratic minimal control problem based on the Brunovsky canonical form with interior-point constraints.
