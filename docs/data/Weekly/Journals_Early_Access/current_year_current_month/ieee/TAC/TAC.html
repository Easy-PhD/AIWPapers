  abstract     = {It is often required that identified models exhibit certain stability and dissipativity properties, e.g., passivity or $\ell _{2}$-gain. The aim of this paper is to develop an unconstrained parametrization of linear parameter-varying (LPV) input-output (IO) discrete-time (DT) models that guarantees stability/dissipativity by construction, i.e., the model is stable/dissipative for any choice of model parameters. To achieve this, it is shown that any quadratically stable/dissipative DT-LPV-IO model can be generated by a mapping of transformed coefficient functions that are constrained to the unit ball. The unit ball is reparameterized through a Cayley transformation, resulting in a fully unconstrained parameterization. These results immediately apply to linear time-varying IO models. In the linear time-invariant case, an unconstrained parameterization of all stable/dissipative DT transfer functions is obtained. The unconstrained parametrization enables, among others, the use of neural network coefficient functions in LPV system identification while guaranteeing stability and dissipativity.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a brand-new phase definition called the segmental phase for multi-input multi-output linear time-invariant systems. The underpinning of the definition lies in the matrix segmental phase which, as its name implies, is graphically based on the smallest circular segment covering the matrix normalized numerical range in the unit disk. The matrix segmental phase has the crucial product eigen-phase bound, which makes itself stand out from several existing phase notions in the literature. The proposed bound paves the way for stability analysis of a single-loop cyclic feedback system consisting of multiple subsystems. A cyclic small phase theorem is then established as our main result, which requires the loop system phase to lie between $-\pi$ and $\pi$. The proposed theorem complements a cyclic version of the celebrated small gain theorem. In addition, a generalization of the proposed theorem is made via the use of angular scaling techniques for reducing conservatism.},

  abstract     = {A privacy-preserving incentive mechanism to maximize the weighted social welfare for pseudo-gradient-based noncooperative dynamical systems is developed. Sensitive information that could reveal the payoff functions is referred to as the privacy of agents. In the proposed approach, at least half of the agents (named as nonessential agents) can provide some nonsensitive information in addition to their state values, enabling the system manager to influence agents' dynamical decisions by imposing taxes or offering subsidies with a sustainable budget constraint. To protect the privacy of all agents, our approach shifts the stationary points of the nonessential agents and hence indirectly moves the Nash equilibrium of the entire system. By constructing the additional nonsensitive information from nonessential agents as the time-wise information of stationary-point mappings related to certain secret matrices, sufficient conditions are derived where the Nash equilibrium is shifted towards the target state achieving Pareto efficiency under the incentive mechanism. We also provide some stability conditions to ensure that agents' state converges to the target state under a sustainable budget for the given initial state. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the efficacy of our results.},

  abstract     = {We present a stochastic constrained output- feedback data-driven predictive control scheme for linear time-invariant systems subject to bounded additive disturbances. The approach uses data-driven predictors based on an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma and requires only a single persistently exciting input-output data trajectory. Compared to current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on availability of exact disturbance data. Instead, we leverage a novel parameterization of the unknown disturbance data considering consistency with the measured data and the system class. This allows for deterministic approximation of the chance constraints in a sampling-based fashion. A robust constraint on the first predicted step enables recursive feasibility, closed-loop constraint satisfaction, and robust asymptotic stability in expectation under standard assumptions. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.},

Then, the distributed estimator and the auxiliary variable are developed for each player to estimate other players' actions and compensate for the unknown nonlinearities, respectively. After constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is proved that the actions of all players globally asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the distributed aggregative optimization challenge in uncertain multiple Euler- Lagrange (EL) systems, where each EL agent's local objective function depends on its own position and the aggregation of all EL agents' positions. The goal is to control all EL agents to reach their optimal positions as defined by the aggregative optimization problem. Two distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are proposed for uncertain EL systems, which are based on distinct optimization-control strategies, namely the open-loop optimization-control strategy and the closed-loop optimization-control strategy. To address the model uncertainty in EL systems, an auxiliary second-order system is introduced, integrating with adaptive compensation and tracking techniques to mitigate the uncertainty. Given the unique structure of the aggregative optimization problem, two distributed estimation protocols are developed for handling the aggregation terms in the optimization problem. Specifically, in the open-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient is derived from the position information of the auxiliary system; whereas, in the closed-loop optimization-control strategy, the optimization gradient relies on the real-time position of the EL system. The convergence of both algorithms is rigorously proved. Unlike existing studies that mainly concentrate on distributed optimization algorithms based on either open-loop or closed-loop strategies, this paper is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of open-loop and closed-loop optimization-control strategies, with a special emphasis on the robustness of the closed-loop strategy in counteracting external disturbances and variations. Finally, the proposed distributed aggregative optimization algorithms are applied to the optimal localization problem of networked marine vehicles with parameter uncertainties. Comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the distributed optimization problem in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noises. Here, a heavy-tailed noise $\xi$ does not necessarily adhere to the bounded variance assumption, i.e., $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^{2}]\leq \nu ^{2}$ for some positive constant $\nu$. Instead, it satisfies a more general condition $ {\mathbb {E}}[\Vert \xi \Vert ^\delta ]\leq \nu ^\delta$ for some $1&lt; \delta \leq 2$. The commonly-used bounded variance assumption is a special case of the considered noise assumption. While several distributed optimization algorithms have been proposed for scenarios involving heavy-tailed noise, these algorithms need a centralized server in the network which collects the information of all clients. Different from these algorithms, this paper considers a scenario where there is no centralized server and the agents can only exchange information with neighbors within a communication graph. A distributed method combining gradient clipping and distributed stochastic gradient projection is proposed. It is proven that when the gradient descent step-size and the gradient clipping step-size meet certain conditions, the state of each agent converges to an optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem with probability 1. The simulation results validate the algorithm.},
