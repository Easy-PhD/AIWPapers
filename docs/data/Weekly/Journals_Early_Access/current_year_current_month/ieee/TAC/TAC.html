  abstract     = {Recent research on epidemic processes has revealed the limitations of traditional networks, which capture only pairwise relationships, to characterize complex multiparty relationships and group influences properly. Epidemic processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and the endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of higher-order interactions. Novel sufficient conditions for different system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, after establishing the local stability of the equilibrium, an explicit domain of attraction linked to the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we validate the approximation efficacy of the mean-field SIS contagion processes compared with the $2^{n}$-state Markov chain models. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS contagion processes.},

These battery units are allowed to have heterogeneous battery parameters and are connected in parallel to deliver a desired total power. Existing power allocating controllers have been developed to achieve SoC balancing without taking balancing speed into consideration. Motivated by this observation, we aim to design new power allocating controllers such that accelerated SoC balancing is achieved. To facilitate our control design, we first introduce a new concept, the powered SoC, and establish new sufficient conditions that guarantee SoC balancing among battery units in the discharging and the charging modes. Based on these new sufficient conditions, we design a power allocating controller for each battery unit. It is shown that the proposed power allocating controllers achieve accelerated SoC balancing while delivering the desired total power. One key merit of our control method lies in achieving faster SoC balancing by tuning the power in the powered SoC. Moreover, we provide in-depth discussions on the SoC evolution trends among the battery units, the limiting case, and the parameter choice. Simulation results are given to validate our analytical results.},

This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.},

A necessary and sufficient condition is established for the OR-system to admit exact observer dynamics. When an exact OR-system does not exist, an extended OR-system is developed by incorporating the original system's observers into its state. Furthermore, a minimal feedback extended OR-system is constructed, and its relationship to Kalman's minimal realization is analyzed.

As a result, related control design methodologies have yet to appear in the literature. In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for $k$-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Building on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce $k$-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a method called Multiplayer Cascaded Policy Iteration (MCPI) for finding Nash equilibrium solutions to non-zero-sum (NZS) differential games. While policy iteration (PI) methods have existed for NZS game problems, they usually return solutions lacking stability guarantees during the iterative process due to using a parallel structure in solution-seeking. To tackle such a stability issue, we now propose MCPI with an essentially different structure in series, which is proven to not only guarantee the stability of the iterative process but also exhibit equivalence to quasi-Newton iteration. Based on MCPI, we further develop a state-feedback algorithm to achieve a data-driven solution for multiplayer NZS games, which does not necessitate knowledge of the system dynamics, relying instead on input and state data to learn Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, by leveraging a homotopic method, we provide a path to address a long-standing challenge in PI-based NZS games with completely unknown dynamics, namely, the model demand for an initial stabilizing control policy, which, however, is required in the existing PI-based NZS works. In addition, we broaden the application of the state-feedback algorithm by introducing an output-feedback MCPI algorithm, which alleviates the necessity for full-dimensional measurement of system states. The output-feedback approach deduces optimal solutions for multiplayer NZS game problems and is characterized by its model-free nature, as it leverages input-output data to operate independently of specific knowledge about system dynamics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of these two model-free algorithms through case studies involving a numerical example and a multi-actuated mechanical rotating rigid body.},

By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either 1 or $+\infty$ to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.},

We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel distributed scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameter, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no “centralized” aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Closed-form state-space expressions for such CIM elements and the resulting equivalent plant are derived for both finite-dimensional and repetitive internal models.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine the role of stochastic quantizers for privacy preservation in control systems. We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its privacy-preserving properties regarding the system's initial state. Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input Gaussian noise.},

Typical CBF safety filter designs assume that the system has a uniform relative degree. This assumption is restrictive and is frequently overlooked in practice. When violated, the assumption can cause the safety filter to become inactive, allowing large and possibly unsafe control inputs to be applied to the system. In discrete-time implementations, the inactivity issue is often manifested as chattering close to the safety boundary and/or constraint violations. In this work, we provide an in-depth discussion on the safety filter inactivity issue, propose a mitigation strategy based on multiple CBFs, and derive an upper bound on the sampling time for safety under sampled-data control.

  abstract     = {Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested. They replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. Such hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge, such as first principles, and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for planning of experiments and generating data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations, which are easier to solve and yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.},

Firstly, a robust observer synthesis approach is adopted to compute an observer gain to improve the accuracy of the point-wise estimation when the discrete measurements are available. In the case of aperiodic discrete-time measurements, a polytopic model with an additive norm-bounded term is proposed to characterize the uncertainties induced by the time-varying character of the inter-measurement interval times. Then, to cope with these uncertainties, a robust observer design method is introduced. Based on the obtained point-wise estimation, an interval estimation is achieved via an interval-based explicit reachability method. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method relies on non-restrictive assumptions and provides high estimation performance. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

A learner can sequentially observe the equilibria reached by the game system as the observable signal changes, and its goal is to identify the unknown parameters in the cost functions. We recast this problem as an online optimization and introduce a novel online parameter identification algorithm. To be specific, we construct a regularized loss function that balances between conservativeness and correctiveness, where the conservativeness term ensures that the renewed estimates do not deviate significantly from the current estimates, while the correctiveness term is captured by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the generalized Nash equilibrium. For which, the balance is adjusted by a learning rate parameter. We then prove that when the players' cost functions are linear with respect to the unknown parameters and the learning rate satisfies μk ∝ 1/ √ k, along with other assumptions, the regret bound of the proposed algorithm is O(√ K) (k and K represent the current round of online algorithm and the total rounds of games played, respectively). Finally, we conduct numerical simulations on the parameter identification of a Nash-Cournot problem to demonstrate that the performance of our proposed online algorithm is comparable to that of the offline setting.},

It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations known from the literature. To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite-dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output Lagrange stability (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from the literature to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.},

First, a novel universal constraint approach is introduced, which combines a universal composite barrier function (UCBF) that depends on the tracking error and the output, with universal barrier functions (UBFs) that depend on the remaining states. Compared with existing research, it displays the following appealing features: 1) both tracking error constraints and full-state constraints are ensured simultaneously without encountering the “feasibility conditions”. The constraints on the tracking error and the output are decoupled, and the constraining functions on both the tracking error and full states, especially including the output, can be directly determined by the user. 2) the proposed approach provides a universal solution that can handle both constrained and unconstrained cases uniformly without changing the control structure. Then, through a new coordinate transformation, the nonlinear system subject to the two constraints is converted into an equivalent “unconstrained” system. Further, by designing a modified filter and utilizing the adaptive backstepping design, an adaptive dynamic surface asymptotic controller is proposed to stabilize the “unconstrained” system. It is theoretically proved that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically without “explosion of complexity”, and the features of the universal constraint approach are achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control is also illustrated by simulation verification.},

Furthermore, it is typical to solve a convex optimization problem at each grid point in continuous time settings, the discrete case reduces this to a straightforward maximization.

With privacy concerns, the exchanged information is masked with independent Laplace noise against potential attackers with access to even all network communication.

In contrast to the existing methods, our proposed approach neither require prior knowledge of the structures of the nonlinearities or their bounding functions, nor use structure approximations to acquire such information.

The objective is to develop a supervisor synthesis algorithm such that the controlled system is enforced to be weighted opaque, that is, no weighted observation can lead to the exposure of specified states. First, we propose the tree of unobservable reach to synthesize the minimal full set of control patterns that covers all possible unobservable reach for the given state. Then, we propose a new structure named weighted all-inclusive controller (W-AIC), which shows all possible reachable states according to different control patterns and presents the reachable states under certain observations. Finally, based on our proposed structure, we can discover all states in which the secrets will be inevitably revealed. By removing these states and making the W-AIC consistent, the maximally permissive supervisors that enforce the non-opaque system to generate secret-preserving languages can be synthesized. It is proved that by employing W-AICs, the enforcement weighted opacity problem can be solved when the accumulated transition costs of successive observations are lower than the user-defined cutoff weight.},

This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.},

Motivated by this challenge, we propose a 3-D angle-based control law such that an aircraft can autonomously move to the target location described by three angle constraints with respect to three ground stations. The proposed control law only needs bearing measurements and communication between the aircraft and the ground stations. By decoupling the dynamics of the angle errors, the proposed control law for single integrator dynamics guarantees global convergence to the target location. Three angles are controlled to converge, which are independent of the orientation of the aircraft's coordinate frame. This control law is more accessible and reliable than those based on relative position. Simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.},

Here we lift this assumption, which is often violated in practice, and instead consider asymmetric agents; specifically, we assume some agents have access to first-order gradient information and others have access to the zeroth-order oracles (cost function evaluations). We propose an asymmetric learning algorithm that combines the agent information mechanisms. We analyze the regret and Nash equilibrium convergence of this algorithm for convex and strongly monotone games, respectively. Specifically, we show that our algorithm always performs between pure first- and zeroth-order methods, and can match the performance of these two extremes by adjusting the number of agents with access to zeroth-order oracles. Therefore, our algorithm incorporates the pure first- and zeroth-order methods as special cases.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a safety-critical control problem for a mobile robot navigating cluttered environments. Obstacles are represented as a closed set, and a direction-distance function is used to model the obstacle measurement process. Based on real-time obstacle measurements, a safety-critical controller is expected to maintain a safe distance between the robot and obstacles while ensuring that the robot's velocity, considered as the control input, follows a given velocity command signal as closely as possible. This paper contributes a regularization method for the obstacle-measurement model in the body-fixed frame and a systematic design of a Lipschitz continuous safety-critical controller based on the regularized obstacle-measurement model and quadratic programming (QP). Specifically, a novel Lipschitz-truncated regularization term is used to replace the conventional quadratic regularization in Moreau-Yosida regularization. It is guaranteed that, for each local minimum distance given by the original direction-distance function and its corresponding direction, there exists a neighborhood around that direction where the value of the regularized direction-distance function does not exceed the local minimum distance. This property is crucial for constructing a feasible set of control input that ensures safety in all directions using only a finite number of constraints. The QP framework is then employed to integrate these safety constraints with nominal velocity commands. A specific positive basis is employed to meet the linear independence constraint qualification, ensuring the Lipschitz continuity of the QP-based safety-critical controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input—the varying delay function—enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the ‘delayED time’ function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic optimization aims to minimize the loss functions with noisy function and/or gradient measurements only. Depending on the types of the underlying variables, optimization problems can often be categorized as continuous, discrete, or mixed (mixture of continuous and discrete variables). Motivated by the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and the discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA) algorithms, we propose the mixed simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (MSPSA) that bridges the gap of dealing with mixed variables. The newly proposed MSPSA unifies the framework of simultaneous perturbation as both SPSA and DSPSA can now be deemed as two special cases of MSPSA. The almost sure convergence and the rate of convergence of the MSPSA iterates are derived. The convergence results reveal that the finite-sample bound of MSPSA is identical to DSPSA when the problem contains only discrete variables, and the asymptotic bound of MSPSA has the same order of magnitude as SPSA when the problem contains only continuous variables.},

  abstract     = {In this note, we study a class of deterministic finite-horizon linear-quadratic difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints involving both state and control variables. We show that the necessary conditions for the existence of generalized open-loop Nash equilibria in this game class lead to two strongly coupled discrete-time linear complementarity systems. Subsequently, we derive sufficient conditions by establishing an equivalence between the solutions of these systems and convexity of the players' objective functions. These conditions are then reformulated as a solution to a linear complementarity problem, providing a numerical method to compute these equilibria. We illustrate our results using a network flow game with constraints.},

  abstract     = {The concept of adaptive input redundancy is introduced in this paper to extend the notion of input redundancy to parameter-dependent systems. Sufficient conditions to verify the adaptive input redundancy of polynomial parameter-dependent systems are provided. It is important to point out that although the obtained conditions depend on the parameter, they can be practically verified in a computational algorithm. The developed strategy uses concepts from the geometric control theory, such as the notion of controlled invariant and output invisible subspaces. Another crucial tool to derive the results of this work is the Smith Normal form of a matrix. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the strategy.},
