  abstract     = {This article concentrates on maximally permissive robustness analysis for automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) that allow multiple server failures in the paradigm of Petri nets (PNs). First, we fully describe resource failures in a more general perspective, formalized as generalized dangerous transitions, and develop an algorithm for computing the set of these transitions. The presence of such transitions results in all subnet systems being divided into two types: dangerous subnet systems and nondangerous subnet systems. Second, based on the number of nondangerous subnets consistently operated, the more general definitions of strongly robust, weakly robust, and nonrobust markings are established. Third, generalized reduced reachability graphs (R2Gs) are constructed to provide a formal tool for robustness analysis. An algorithm is formulated to compute the maximum nondangerous elementary circuits (NDE circuits) for each marking in generalized R2G. Subsequently, by analyzing the transitions involved in the maximum NDE circuits, we derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the robustness of markings. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed methods and illustrate their advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The increasing structural and operational interdependencies between power distribution networks (PDNs) and district heating networks (DHNs) have intensified the need for integrated and resilient contingency management strategies. This necessitates the development of advanced analytical frameworks for probabilistic N-1 and N-k security assessments that capture the temporal and spatial coupling of these networks throughout all phases of resilient operations. Owing to this necessity, this article proposes a novel contingency multicriteria assessment framework to quantify the interdependencies between the resilience of PDNs and DHNs, incorporating various phases of contingency chains. The methodology utilizes the simultaneous evaluation of criteria and alternatives (SECA) approach to systematically rank critical contingencies, thereby revealing the most severe potential cascading failures that threaten energy security. The following stage entails the presentation of a pioneering spatiotemporal cascading failure analytical model, which is developed to coordinate the withstand-and-recover phases across interdependent PDNs and DHNs. This model is supported by tailored operational resilience key performance indicators (KPIs) that trace power-induced heating service degradation across diverse backup configurations, including line-pack storage, energy storage systems (ESSs), and integrated demand–response programs (DRPs). As another unattainable novelty, the developed decision-making framework integrates static and dynamic resilience analyses to provide an all-encompassing comprehension of the integrated PDNs and DHNs’ resilience. The proposed framework is validated through co-simulation of a modified IEEE 33-bus PDN and a 32-node DHN, employing analytical and empirical methodologies. The results indicate that the strategic implementation of backup flexibility resources, when synchronized with DHN service provision, can enhance DHN service continuity by up to 29%, while concurrently reducing the full recovery time by nearly 41%. Dynamic resilience analyses are further conducted in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to evaluate the real-time transient response under top-ranked contingency scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A novel distributed adaptive containment tracking control method is proposed for stochastic multiagent systems (MASs). Unlike existing results, we consider a more general system with both multiple dynamic leaders and unknown covariance. The control input of each agent system depends only on the states of its neighbors and its local states. When dealing with unknown time-varying covariance, we do not need to know its bound but use a proper estimation. Then, by using the backstepping design method, an adaptive law and a distributed adaptive tracking controller are designed. Using stochastic analysis and graph theory, it is proved that the outputs of the followers converge exponentially to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the dynamic leaders under the condition that all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the tracking error is tunable. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of the design scheme through numerical simulation.},

In order to overcome the unknown mathematical model of the system and enhance the ability of consensus control of LSNH-MASs, a model-free adaptive hierarchical resilient cloud control (MFAHRCC) strategy, only using input and output data, is proposed. This strategy can reduce the negative impact of the DCA-DoS attacks by designing a compensation factor. The stability and consensus of LSNH-MASs in insecure network environment are strictly proved. Under the constructed cloud control framework, the computation burden of all agents is borne by the cloud controller, which not only improves the ability of real-time processing data of the system but also greatly reduces the hardware cost of agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the MFAHRCC algorithm proposed in this article is verified by simulation with comparisons.},

First, a mathematical model for DAFSP with batch delivery is constructed. Second, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is enhanced to solve the concerned problems. Two dispatch rules are designed to enhance the quality and diversity of initial solutions. Third, seven local search operators tailored to problem characteristics and two objective-oriented machine speed adjustment strategies are designed for improving the performance of ABC. Two reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, SARSA and Q-learning, are used to select the appropriate local search operators and speed adjustment strategies during iterations. Two pairs of state-action strategies are developed for local search selection and speed adjustment, respectively. Finally, extensive simulation experiments and detailed analysis demonstrate that the SARSA-assisted ABC has a better performance than its peers for DAFSP with batch delivery.},

The innovative scenario follows the behaviors characteristic for its predecessors, in particular in terms of maximum-speed and maximum-accuracy properties. It should be emphasized that the new solution is more general than the existing linear ones, providing the complex original peculiarities.

  abstract     = {This article explores the issue of fault-tolerant optimal pursuit strategies in a nonlinear pursuit-evasion (PE) game involving multiple pursuers and a single evader. The main challenge lies in ensuring the successful capture of the evader despite the presence of actuator partial loss of effectiveness and bias faults within the pursuers group. To overcome this challenge, a two-layer control architecture is proposed. At the control layer, an integral sliding-mode controller is developed to mitigate the impact of bias faults, and an adaptive estimation mechanism is incorporated to identify the fault parameters. At the decision-making layer, performance index functions for both the pursuers and the evader are formulated based on the PE state error and their respective control strategies, and optimal pursuit and evasion strategies are derived by solving the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Furthermore, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed, with each participant using a critic network to approximate the optimal strategies for the pursuers and the evader. The proposed control mechanism is theoretically proven to ensure that all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, allowing the faulty pursuers to successfully capture the evader. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is validated through two simulation examples.},
