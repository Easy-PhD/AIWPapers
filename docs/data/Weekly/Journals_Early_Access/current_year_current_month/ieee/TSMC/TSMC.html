First, a sampled-data full-form dynamic linearization data model employing the principles of differential and integral mean value theorems is established to address the unknown nonlinearities of the continuous-time MASs. Afterward, a time-varying fault detection threshold is developed to ascertain the occurrence of sensor faults. Subsequently, the unknown sensor faults are approximated by the fuzzy neural network algorithm, and the uncertain parameters of MASs are tackled by the projection algorithm. A rigorous stability analysis for the proposed SD-FTBFC algorithm is thoroughly presented. Ultimately, the simulation outcomes utilizing multiple unmanned ground vehicles confirm the efficacy of the proposed SD-FTBFC algorithm.},

  abstract     = {NAS can automatically design well-performing architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been widely investigated for real-world applications. However, neural architecture search (NAS) is computationally expensive because vast DNNs are trained to obtain the performance during the search process. Performance predictors can directly obtain the performance of DNNs without training, thus having great potential to overcome this barrier. However, existing performance predictors are typically offline, and are trained with rare architectures labeled. As a result, their predictive ability is limited due to ignoring the promising DNN architectures generated in the NAS process. In this article, we propose a Gaussian process-based online performance predictor (GPOPP) tailored to evolutionary NAS. To achieve this, GPOPP selects the proper architectures to update itself during the search process upon EI as an acquisition function. Further, as architectures cannot be directly used as training data, GPOPP includes a binary encoding schema that can convert the architectures into a suitable format. Although the original intention of designing GPOPP is to provide an alternative way to build promising performance predictors that may compromise performance, the experiments show that GPOPP can outperform most state-of-the-arts. For example, GPOPP-assisted NAS gains 76.1% in accuracy on ImageNet with only 1.1 graphic processing unit (GPU) Days. In addition, the ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the components designed in GPOPP. The source code is available at https://github.com/songxt3/GPOPP.},

First, the systems with external disturbances and parameter uncertainties are modeled via a fuzzy framework, and an improved hybrid attack model is developed by incorporating aperiodic DoS and FDI attacks. The adaptive event-triggered (ET) output feedback controller is proposed to handle unmeasured states and resource constraints. Then, to capture fuzzy information, a piecewise fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional incorporating membership functions (MFs) is meticulously constructed using delayed fuzzy system theory. The fuzzy information learning algorithm is further designed to determine and exploit the actual lower and upper bounds of MF’ derivatives, resulting in an effective controller with enhanced control performance and resource efficiency. Eventually, the ET strategy parameters, controller gains, and the optimal performance index are derived within a unified framework, ensuring global exponential stability and guaranteed H∞ performance. Finally, the merits and applicability of the proposed approach are exemplified by a practical example.},

Multimode switched systems can describe a wider range of complex processes, but most of the existing switching laws are fixed and lack flexibility. To address these issues, on the one hand, a transitive ILC (T-ILC) method is proposed to mitigate the effect of data network delay; on the other hand, a novel tracking performance-driven switching law (TPD-SL) is proposed. T-ILC can ensure the correct order of data through timestamps and memory identification. TPD-SL can ensure that the system switches to the subsystem with better tracking performance according to the change rate of the tracking error. Furthermore, we adopt an event-triggered communication method to save network computing resources. The stability of the system is demonstrated under the T-ILC and TPD-SL, and the relationship among network delay, event-triggering, and synchronous switching (controller switching aligned with system mode transition) versus asynchronous switching (controller switching with delayed mode transition) is analyzed. Numerical simulation results confirm that the method is effective.},

The method is applicable to signals in vector form composed of sum of multiple signals received from multiple sources. Another advantage of the method is that it is structured to operate online. The stability of the proposed identification framework is analyzed via novel Lyapunov-type tools where global uniform ultimate boundedness of the estimation errors is ensured.

  abstract     = {In light of the shortage of acupuncturists and issues such as subjectivity leading to inconsistent efficacy and variability in accuracy and stability, an eight-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dexterous acupuncture robot system is developed in this article. An effective model predictive control (MPC) scheme, integrating needle bending compensation and manipulative techniques, is proposed to ensure the safety, accuracy, and stability of acupuncture manipulative trajectory tracking control. Based on acupuncture’s working scenarios, a dexterous 2-DOF acupuncture mechanism is designed. Then, the kinematic and acupoint models are established. To enhance the controller’s robustness, trajectory tracking constraints are included as soft constraints in the objective function before needle insertion, leading to the development of a trajectory-constrained MPC (TCMPC) model. This model not only improves the tracking accuracy and convergence speed but also ensures the stability of the solution. Additionally, a needle bending correction trajectory control method, considering needle deformation, is derived to perceive and correct the needle bending deformation under complex force environments. Furthermore, an adaptive impedance control method, integrating feedforward-feedback control (FFC), is proposed to simultaneously control force and track manipulative techniques under various contact environments. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is verified using the Lyapunov theory.

This statics modeling method reduces the complexity of the model and considers the most common forces and moments. Second, a solving flow is proposed based on the iteration-correction strategy for configuration prediction or force sensing. This strategy provides a new idea for the analysis of the static friction direction when the statics model is used for quasi-static prediction. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed segment-progress statics method is effective for configuration prediction or force sensing of concentric cable-driven manipulators. Moreover, the effect of the friction gain on the accuracy of statics model is found by analyzing the curvature of the manipulator. The piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption is also concluded to be only applicable to small end forces but not to large end forces for concentric cable-driven manipulators.},

The SDSBF method permits subsystems to lack safety over the whole safe set, which relaxes the traditional requirement that all subsystems are safe. Also, the influence on safety of switched systems caused by the difference of sampling instant and switching instant is analyzed, and a switching signal with dwell time is introduced to quantify and estimate this influence. Furthermore, both safety and stability of switched systems under ZOH controllers are obtained by the union of SDSBF and single Lyapunov function (SLF), without requiring the safety and stability for subsystems. To find SDSBF and SLF, an executable condition, including a switching law with dwell time, is established based on convex combination techniques, avoiding the Zeno phenomenon.

Although researchers have discussed the application of ZNN in chaos synchronization, these ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers are rarely used in real-world applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no researchers have applied the ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers in secure voice communication. In this study, we established a novel chaos synchronization controller based on the proportional–integral-convergence-parameter ZNN (PICP-ZNN) model, which is both computationally efficient and intelligent. It was then used in secure voice communication. To demonstrate the superior features of the proposed PICP-ZNN model, we presented both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to show its fixed-time convergence, robustness, and adaptiveness. In addition, a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art variable-convergence-parameter ZNNs was presented to highlight our contribution further. The upper bound of the settling time is also estimated in both noisy and noise-free environments. Overall, this study offers a novel ZNN-based secure communication scheme.

This neural network efficiently handles unmodeled components in the system and approximates unknown nonlinear functions. An ETC mechanism with a relative threshold strategy is introduced, balancing the control effectiveness of the active mass damper (AMD) and extending operational lifespan. The ultimate boundedness of the system is verified using the Lyapunov direct method, ensuring convergence of vibration displacement and acceleration toward zero. The efficacy of this control scheme is demonstrated through detailed numerical simulations and experimental analyses.},

  abstract     = {Industrial multimode operation commonly exists in chemical process control systems. The fundamental mechanism is classifying operational modes and identifying the local models w.r.t. typical operating conditions, such that the global dynamic characteristics can be aligned with the switching control strategies for flexible operation demands. This article proposes a novel integrated economic predictive control (EMPC) method, to account for the mutual coupling economic optimization objectives and overlapping feasible regions in mode decision-making and dynamic control. In the proposed EMPC formulation, the prediction and optimization are carried out on all of the switched-admissible modes, which have been predetermined together with the stabilization conditions at the preliminary stage. The switching signal and input sequences are combined-optimized for achieving the best accumulated economic cost defined on the optimal predicted trajectories. The switching feasibility, and local/global stability under specified DT constraints are guaranteed by the stabilization constraints designed in EMPC. Through theoretical analysis and simulation comparisons, the proposed approach is demonstrated to tackle with the infeasible problem that inevitably arises in the classic hierarchical decision-making architectures; moreover, it exhibits better closed-loop accumulated economic cost in the illustrated cases.},

To solve this issue, an optimal pitch control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed for MOWTs, which comprehensively considers both power generation and load mitigation performance. First, the motion equation of the tower together with monopile under wind-wave environment is constructed on the foundation of the Euler–Lagrange equation. For the convenience of the controller design, a novel nonlinear affine MOWT mathematical model is presented, and an ADP-based optimal pitch controller is proposed to solve the multiobjective optimal control problem. Then, the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the system is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the proposed control method, a national renewable energy laboratory (NREL) 5-MW offshore code comparison collaborative (OC3) MOWT has been emulated using the OpenFAST platform developed by the NREL.},

Fuzzy reaction-diffusion NNs extend traditional NNs by incorporating spatial dynamics through reaction-diffusion processes, offering improved modeling capabilities for complex systems. However, the combination of reaction-diffusion terms and fuzzy modeling increases the complexity of dynamic analysis, particularly in synchronization control. To address these challenges, a novel random TSSDC (RTSSDC) framework is developed. The proposed approach integrates random sampling across both temporal and spatial dimensions with an innovative random event-triggered communication scheme to increase resource utilization efficiency and accommodate real-world network conditions. A unified closed-loop model is established by introducing a packet loss scheduling strategy to handle data disorder caused by significant transmission delays. The framework incorporates switching gains to provide additional flexibility and robustness. Ultimately, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the superior synchronization performance and efficient resource utilization under random sampling and network-induced delays.},

It involves three critical and interrelated operational optimization issues: 1) PS; 2) resource scheduling; and 3) manual picking. Each of them is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Their integration is a significant challenge for operational optimization in RMFS with multiple picking stations and represents a novel problem that was not studied before to our best knowledge. To tackle this complex problem and fill the research gap, we first model it as a MIP to derive exact solutions for small-scale and illustrative cases. For industrial-scale cases that cannot be solved by exact methods given limited time, we propose a tailored learning-strategies-enhanced local search algorithm. It integrates a 3-D bi-section encoding strategy, a three-stage decoding policy, a learning-based ANS method, and two learning-based tabu mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving 2.9% to 33.2% performance improvement over six competitive peers.

  abstract     = {Medium-scale expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) present a significant challenge to most existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). Because the algorithms must balance convergence and diversity with a limited number of fitness evaluations (FEs), while managing the uncertainty in surrogate predictions within the medium-scale decision space. Therefore, this work proposes a surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on two-level model management (SAMOEA-TL2M) to effectively address medium-scale EMOPs. In SAMOEA-TL2M, infill solutions are selected using the proposed two-level model management strategy. In the first level, the estimated non-dominated solutions with good shift-based density estimation (SDE) values are selected for the balance of convergence and diversity. In the second level, the estimated non-dominated solutions and high uncertainty solutions are considered. To quantify uncertainty, an inverse distance weighting (IDW) is introduced. Moreover, an accuracy rate indicator (ARI) is proposed for the optimization state assessment, providing guidance for adaptively executing the two model management levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used instances and time-varying ratio error estimation (TREE) problems with up to 120 dimensions demonstrate the superiority of SAMOEA-TL2M over five state-of-the-art SAEAs in solving medium-scale EMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication is pivotal for successful team collaboration in cooperative multiagent tasks. However, mainly due to the partially observable nature of the environment, indiscriminate message requests among teammates may lead to confusion for individual agents, impeding effective collaboration and diminishing the overall efficiency of the system. Most previous work has employed gates or attention mechanisms to extract relatively important messages. However, these methods often fail to explicitly assess each message’s value, or the process of calculating is intricate and convoluted. This may result in ineffective communication and cause miscoordination in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric named counterfactual message value (CMV), which quantifies each message’s contribution to an agent, enabling the effective elimination of redundant messages. In addition, we present a practical multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, termed CMV communication (CMVC), which could effectively facilitate the learning of agent–agent communication protocols. It predicts the CMVs of teammates for an agent solely based on its local observation, enabling the agent to initiate communication with those exhibiting positive CMVs. To differentiate message impact levels, we design a message aggregator in CMVC that aggregates messages based on their individual CMVs. We evaluate CMVC in various tasks, including cooperative navigation, predator–prey, and the StarCraft multiagent challenge (SMAC). The results indicate that CMVC is prominent in reducing redundant messages and has the ability to learn more advanced collaboration strategies, in contrast to several existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Its large-scale dynamic transaction records contain a variety of behavioral patterns and rich knowledge involving accounts, making the dynamic cryptocurrency transaction network embedding (DCTNE) a hot, yet thorny research topic. As the trading accounts increase and time accumulates, considerable transaction services are dispersed into various time slots, leading to very sparse transaction data within a time slot, that is, the transaction service data is high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI). To efficiently mine high-value knowledge from HDI data, this article proposes a proximal-ADMM-incorporated nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (PNL) model for DCTNE that adopts threefold ideas: 1) incorporating the proximal terms into the alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (ADMMs)-based learning scheme to reduce the oscillations for high estimation accuracy and fast convergence; 2) implementing a parallel training process with hyperparameter self-adaptation for high computational efficiency; and 3) proving that the proximal-incorporated learning scheme guarantees the convergence to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) stationary point. Experimental results on eight real-world DCTNs show that the PNL significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating not only high efficiency and accuracy in performing DCTNE, but also strong potential to enhance the operational reliability and stability of cryptocurrency transaction systems.},

As the number of participants continues to grow, the likelihood of undesirable outcomes increases, posing a great requirement for effective community detection algorithms. To provide platform owners with actionable and timely management strategies, this article proposes a multimodule-based dynamic community detection (MDCD) algorithm to facilitate the achievement of efficient, high-quality, and sustainable innovation. The MDCD algorithm uses a multimodule task learning framework containing four different modules, including heterogeneous temporal aggregation (HTA), representation reconstruction (RR), link prediction (LP), and node clustering (NC) modules, to gradually detect the community structure accurately. First, the HTA module obtains the initial node representation by capturing both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. Second, the RR module considers reconstructed topology and node attribute information to update the node representation via an encoder–decoder collaboration mechanism. Third, the LP module further optimizes the node representation by exploiting the predicted graph links, which helps increase the accuracy of community detection. Finally, the NC module leverages two metric learning methods to optimize a learnable clustering process based on the predicted node presentations, which helps platform owners achieve comprehensive results across multiple dimensions of innovation performance. The experimental results from real-world crowdsourcing platforms indicate that MDCD shows effectiveness in simultaneously improving the multidimensional innovation performance of crowdsourcing platforms and increasing solver engagement.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the flexible job shop scheduling problem with a certain number of automatic guided vehicles (FJSP-AGVs), aiming to minimize the makespan. First, a novel constraint programming (CP) model is formulated to obtain optimal solutions. Specifically, the proposed CP model addresses the shortcomings of the existing CP model, which cannot solve instances with a machine processing two consecutive operations of the same job. Additionally, redundant and symmetry-breaking constraints are designed to accelerate constraint propagation and break problem symmetry, respectively. Then, to more effectively solve FJSP-AGVs, a CP-assisted meta-heuristic algorithm framework is designed, with a CP-assisted dual-population collaborative genetic algorithm (DCGA-CP) being developed as an example.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a sustainable human-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework to address the challenge of learning performance degradation when the human guidance is suspended. First, a compensation reward based on the historical similarity between the RL agent and human guidance history is designed to ensure the continued influence of human guidance. To avoid cumulative errors in value function approximation caused by fitting the new reward, including the compensation reward, a novel RL paradigm is proposed, which bypasses value function fitting and directly optimizes the policy using historical similarity. This paradigm develops a new historical similarity-based learning objective for RL to leverage human guidance more efficiently and achieve alignment with human behavior. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm enables the fine-tuning of the RL agent to address the long-tail problem. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of sustainable guidance and optimal performance in the autonomous driving, achieving a 15% increase in optimal performance compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {In power systems, taking economic actions in accordance with the N-k criterion despite the failure of the components is becoming important in today’s smart grid. In this context, developing strategies against load shedding during unexpected events plays a critical role in ensuring energy sustainability. In this article, a loop-in-loop model that includes a rolling horizon-based distributed coordination is established among the transmission system operator (TSO), distribution system operator (DSO), and an industrial parking region operator (IPRO) connected to the transmission network (TN) to address unexpected TN contingencies. The model minimizes the total operational costs for each operator while also minimizing load shedding in the distribution network during contingency situations by leveraging the dc fast discharge capacity of heavy-duty electric trucks (HDETs) with a high-capacity battery located in the industrial parking region. In addition, a contingency system operator (CSO) is introduced to manage contingency and optimally reward the discharge of HDETs through a pricing mechanism. Consequently, in the rolling horizon-based real-time contingency management, the proposed approach reduces the economic losses for the TSO and the amount of shedding load for the DSO compared with uncoordinated operations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves up to 33.18% reduction in load shedding and 28.18% cost savings compared with the baseline scheme, confirming its effectiveness under contingency scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Traditional group decision making (GDM) problems typically aim to obtain a complete ranking of all considered alternatives from best to worst. However, in numerous real-life scenarios, there are instances where it is imperative to assign each alternative into one of two rank levels, creating a ranking where one subset of alternatives is prioritized above the other subset of alternatives. These scenarios are known as 2-rank GDM problems. While a range of methods exist for addressing 2-rank GDM problems, most are specifically tailored to multiattribute decision making situations, thereby limiting their applicability in scenarios involving preference relations. The linguistic preference relation (LPR) is an effective representation tool of decision makers’ (DMs’) preferences for pairwise comparisons of alternatives using linguistic terms. Since words may have different meanings for different DMs, a phenomenon known as personalized individual semantics (PISs), the modeling of linguistic PISs in 2-rank GDM problems with LPRs is worth investigating and challenging to address. Consequently, this article develops models to support consensus reaching for 2-rank linguistic GDM problems with PISs and consistency of DMs. Specifically, PIS consistency-driven models are initially employed to measure and improve the consistency of the LPRs of the individual DMs with unacceptable consistency level. Based on this foundation, the 2-rank vectors for both individuals and the group are determined. Subsequently, a 2-rank consensus measurement method is proposed on which a 2-rank consensus reaching process is designed to support DMs in improving their consensus levels. This involves the development of a PISs-based minimum adjustment consensus optimization model and a PISs-based individual consensus level maximization model. An algorithm to implement the proposed consensus reaching framework is also provided. Finally, numerical experiments and simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Different from existing works, the configuration of the formation for NMRs is time-varying, which requires formation tracking errors to keep convergent even if the configuration of the desired formation changes over time. A novel sliding mode controller is proposed to handle this problem, and the closed-loop stabilities of NMRs under given control protocols are proven by Lyapunov theory. As special cases of TVF, the above control methods can be directly applied to flexible formation and fixed formation studied in existing works. It should be pointed out that if the desired formation is fixed, the angular velocity of the tracking target is not necessary when designing the corresponding control algorithm. In addition, there is no singularity in the methods provided in this article. By collaborative selection of parameters in these control protocols, the adjustment ranges of linear and angular velocities associated with the leader or virtual leader are almost the same as that of followers. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations further verify the theoretical results.},

The system model is formulated as a family of controllable submodels based on controllability. These controllable submodels are regarded as moving targets. A residual-based attack detector is introduced to justify whether an attack occurs or not. When an alarm is triggered, the current running controllable submodel is switched to another controllable one. Furthermore, an MTD-based security controller is devised to proactively mitigate actuator attacks. Sufficient conditions for the design of security control gains are formulated, using which the CPSs can preserve the mean-square exponential stability with the desired disturbance rejection level.

Compared to existing results on attack detection, the developed mechanism is capable of adapting to the ellipsoid-dependent set-membership estimation framework that incorporates the set ideas. Second, a group of scalable resilient set-membership estimators are derived for large-scale sensor networks. Each sensor has access to an ellipsoidal estimation set containing the true state of the system, in which the proposed design procedure is independent of global information about the network topology. Third, a set of parameter optimization algorithms is introduced in a recursive manner, which allows the sensor network to obtain a satisfactory estimation performance utilizing the designed estimation gain and detection mechanism. Lastly, a simulation example is shown to evaluate the availability and superiority of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal timing optimization (TSTO) is a significant problem in smart cities. Evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms have been widely studied to solve the TSTO problem. However, as existing EC-based algorithms usually use iterative-based evolution and simulation-based evaluation to optimize the timing plan for certain traffic situations, they still suffer from two difficulties, which are the time-consuming optimization process in certain traffic situations and the weak adaptation ability to unseen traffic situations. Therefore, this article proposes a novel learning for adaptation (LA) framework for real-time TSTO by changing the optimization process from evolution to adaptation. The LA learns a map model from the traffic volume input to the traffic signal timing. Then, the learned map model is expected to adapt to unseen traffic situations faster and better. The LA framework includes a data collection stage and a model learning (ML) stage. First, in the data collection stage, a multisource transfer-based particle swarm optimization (MTPSO) algorithm is proposed to avoid the under-optimizing issue. Second, in the ML stage, a multilevel smoothness regularization (MSR) method is proposed to deal with the over-fitting issue. The proposed LA framework with MTPSO and MSR is named as LMM method. This way, the TSTO process is changed from time-consuming evolution to time-efficient adaptation, which is significant in practical real-time applications. Comprehensive experiments with ten different synthetic and real-world road networks under different traffic volume distributions are carried out. The results show that the LMM method adapts better to unseen traffic volume inputs and can achieve real-time TSTO.},

  abstract     = {Network reconstruction, which involves inferring a network’s topology from observational data, is a critical challenge in network science. Because observational data are often limited, prior knowledge is often employed to enhance the accuracy of network reconstruction, including constraints related to sparsity, symmetry, or network dynamics. In many cases, we may possess prior knowledge regarding the number of types of edges within networks, yet the specific solutions of these types of edges remain unknown. For instance, while it is evident that two types of edges (i.e., positive and negative) exist in signed networks, the possible solution for each edge type is frequently unclear, rendering existing methods, such as the signal Lasso approach, ineffective. In this work, to effectively leverage this readily available prior knowledge, we propose a novel network reconstruction framework based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which integrates Bayesian models and employs the GMM to model the distribution of unknown edges as prior probabilities. The method is effective for both unsigned and signed networks and achieves high accuracy even with limited prior information, without requiring specific solutions for each edge type, particularly in cases of network sparsity or noisy data.},

Existing research on the DDP of Boolean networks (BNs) has predominantly concentrated on deterministic BNs (DBNs), which inadequately model the complexities of real-world systems, particularly those exhibiting stochastic behavior and uncertainty. We introduce two definitions tailored to PBNs: disturbance decoupling in distribution and disturbance decoupling with probability one. Utilizing an algebraic representation framework, we derive algebraic conditions for both types of disturbance decoupling. Additionally, we employ a vertex partitioning approach to establish graphical conditions pertinent to these disturbance decoupling types. Our investigation further reveals the connections between DBNs and PBNs concerning disturbance decoupling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results, we present three examples.},

  abstract     = {In general, the motion control problem of redundant robot manipulators (RRMs) can be transformed into a constrained time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. Recently, various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with predefined time convergence (PTC) abilities have been proposed to solve this constrained TVQP problem in real-time. However, there is still a lack of a unified paradigm to guide researchers and engineers design such RNNs more effectively based on specific requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified paradigm derived from a novel segmentation evolution formula incorporating a special $\mathfrak{B}$–Class function. This paradigm enables the construction of various RNNs, collectively referred to as unified arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNNs (U-APTC-RNNs). Compared with most existing RNNs, the constructed U-APTC-RNN has two significant advantages: 1) it has the arbitrarily PTC (APTC) ability, meaning its actual convergence time can be arbitrarily and precisely predefined without setting other model parameters and 2) using a novel piecewise computation strategy, redundant nonlinear calculations are effectively minimized, leading to a notable reduction in computational costs. The stability and APTC ability of the constructed U-APTC-RNN are demonstrated through detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulation experiments confirm the APTC capabilities of various U-APTC-RNNs constructed using the proposed unified paradigm. Comparative experiments show that U-APTC-RNN has more competitive convergence performance and lower computational cost than other state-of-the-art RNNs with PTC abilities. Finally, simulation and physical motion control experiments on the Jaco and UR5 robotic arms demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed U-APTC-RNN.},

This article introduces a novel opinion evolution model to simulate the impact of conformity on group opinion formation, focusing on weight allocation, relationship propagation, and evolution analysis. In the weight allocation phase, individual weights are evaluated using network structure and the PageRank algorithm. For relationship propagation, indirect trust relationships are computed via a weighted average method, leading to a more precise social network model. In the evolution analysis, an improved Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model demonstrates evolutionary stability. Two types of conformity behavior are simulated: active conformity behavior within clusters and passive conformity behavior via opinion leaders across clusters. Experimental studies on public health policy validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that this model more accurately captures the complex behavioral patterns of individuals in large-scale social networks and exhibits strong evolutionary stability.},

  abstract     = {One of the primary challenges in quadrupedal locomotion pertains to the robot’s ability to adapt its gait to the surrounding environment and the desired task. This capability allows quadrupedal robots to select suitable foothold locations and adjust their gait for optimal performance. We address the problem of gait adaptation using trajectory optimization (TO), which takes into account the simplified switched system’s dynamics and optimizes the different phases of motion in which we split the robot’s movement. The robot dynamic model is a single rigid body (SRB) with a rigid contact model and foot positions. We apply contact and friction cone constraints to ensure a physically feasible motion of the real robot. We tackle the optimization using the direct multiple shooting (DMS) method. Leveraging kinematic inversion to map the base and feet positions into joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, we design a controller that combines iterative learning control (ILC) and proportional derivative (PD) feedback control. The iterative controller compensates for the sim-to-real gap, allowing the real robot to learn the task during the execution of the latter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two different quadrupedal robots and on different terrains.},

A novel robust adaptive controller is developed, where the adaptive term adapts to the effects of the time-varying unknown parameters in the FAS and the unknown constant in the uncertainty bound, and the robust term overcomes the influence of the remaining uncertain part caused by the perturbed input matrix. The designed controller enables the states of the closed-loop system and the estimation errors to be globally bounded.

In recent years, learning-based methods, as a novel technology, have been widely studied, hoping to overcome the high computational cost of traditional methods. However, to our best knowledge, timetable robustness, as another critical factor in TTR, is often ignored in existing work. To fill this gap, this study proposes a learning-based method for rapidly restoring train delays with robustness guarantees. Compared with the existing work, our approach offers several benefits. First, we design a network architecture for learning-based methods when solving the robust TTR problem. The dual-headed network can deal with the reordering and re-timing operation simultaneously in the TTR problem. Second, we reformulate the robust TTR problem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and a Lagrange-based proximal policy optimization (LPPO) algorithm is employed to train the designed network. Through testing on real-scale problems, the learned model can not only provide the rescheduled timetable within seconds but also strike a fine balance between operation efficiency and the scheme’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Visible–infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) focuses on accurately matching individuals across different imaging modalities. Existing studies focus on generating modality-consistent images at the pixel level through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the impact of modality discrepancies. However, these methods face significant challenges in overcoming the limitation that synthesized samples from different modalities may suffer from semantic distortion. In this work, we propose an online one-stage style fuzzy normalization (SFN) method to generate modality-fuzzy features in the latent space while regularizing the model’s predictions. Specifically, SFN adaptively mixes the feature statistics of two random modality instances of the same identity in a single forward pass during training. In this process, to enhance the richness of modality interaction information, we design a novel causality balance loss, which enforces the generated fuzzy features to be independent of their initial modality while simultaneously encouraging them to align more closely with the other modality. Furthermore, we introduce an identity-aware consistency loss to regularize the predictions between the original and SFN-generated features to ensure semantic consistency. In contrast to prior work, SFN is a plug-and-play module that does not rely on any generative-based models, making it highly adaptable to various network architectures. Extensive experiments were performed on three public cross-modality datasets to ensure fair and reliable comparisons. The empirical results demonstrate the clear superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, the system dynamics are modeled using Itô-type stochastic differential equations, which include deterministic fuzzy complex networks (CNs) as a special case.

To address these issues, this article proposes a novel fault-tolerant control strategy that ensures fixed-time trajectory tracking with prescribed accuracy for underactuated AUVs. The proposed approach integrates boundary functions with a constraint-handling mechanism, enabling guaranteed tracking performance within a fixed time horizon while satisfying output constraints. Unlike existing approaches, the controller does not rely on accurate system models, parameter estimation, or external observers, and avoids the computation of virtual control derivatives, resulting in reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the control scheme maintains robustness against time-varying actuator faults and environmental disturbances without auxiliary adaptation or learning mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed approach compared with existing methods, validating its capability to maintain tracking accuracy and closed-loop stability under adverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recently, CNN and Transformer hybrid networks demonstrated excellent performance in face super-resolution (FSR) tasks. Because of numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multiscale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided multiscale interaction network (AMINet), which incorporates local and global feature interactions, as well as encoder–decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a local and global feature interaction (LGFI) module to promote the fusion of global features and the local features extracted from different receptive fields by our residual depth feature extraction (RDFE) module. Additionally, we propose a selective kernel attention fusion (SKAF) module to adaptively select fusions of different features within the LGFI and encoder–decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multiscale features from within modules and between the encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.},

  abstract     = {In this article, an adaptive vision-admittance-based leakage-type (LT) sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed to solve the uncertain robots’ compliant force control problem with actuator saturation. First, we design the vision-admittance-based model to generate an online reference trajectory concerning the predefined task trajectory and the interaction force command in the image feature space. Second, an adaptive SMC (ASMC) is created to track the generated reference image feature trajectory with high precision. An LT adaptive control law is applied in this controller to overcome the system uncertainties’ impacts in the situation where the upper bound of uncertainty is unknown. Moreover, an auxiliary dynamic term is taken into account in this controller’s design to solve the saturation nonlinearity problem. The feature tracking error can be guaranteed to be convergent according to the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, prototype experiments are conducted on a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) STEP SD7/700 robot to validate the superiority of the proposed control methodology.},
