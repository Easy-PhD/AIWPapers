  abstract     = {This article concentrates on maximally permissive robustness analysis for automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) that allow multiple server failures in the paradigm of Petri nets (PNs). First, we fully describe resource failures in a more general perspective, formalized as generalized dangerous transitions, and develop an algorithm for computing the set of these transitions. The presence of such transitions results in all subnet systems being divided into two types: dangerous subnet systems and nondangerous subnet systems. Second, based on the number of nondangerous subnets consistently operated, the more general definitions of strongly robust, weakly robust, and nonrobust markings are established. Third, generalized reduced reachability graphs (R2Gs) are constructed to provide a formal tool for robustness analysis. An algorithm is formulated to compute the maximum nondangerous elementary circuits (NDE circuits) for each marking in generalized R2G. Subsequently, by analyzing the transitions involved in the maximum NDE circuits, we derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying the robustness of markings. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed methods and illustrate their advantages over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The increasing structural and operational interdependencies between power distribution networks (PDNs) and district heating networks (DHNs) have intensified the need for integrated and resilient contingency management strategies. This necessitates the development of advanced analytical frameworks for probabilistic N-1 and N-k security assessments that capture the temporal and spatial coupling of these networks throughout all phases of resilient operations. Owing to this necessity, this article proposes a novel contingency multicriteria assessment framework to quantify the interdependencies between the resilience of PDNs and DHNs, incorporating various phases of contingency chains. The methodology utilizes the simultaneous evaluation of criteria and alternatives (SECA) approach to systematically rank critical contingencies, thereby revealing the most severe potential cascading failures that threaten energy security. The following stage entails the presentation of a pioneering spatiotemporal cascading failure analytical model, which is developed to coordinate the withstand-and-recover phases across interdependent PDNs and DHNs. This model is supported by tailored operational resilience key performance indicators (KPIs) that trace power-induced heating service degradation across diverse backup configurations, including line-pack storage, energy storage systems (ESSs), and integrated demand–response programs (DRPs). As another unattainable novelty, the developed decision-making framework integrates static and dynamic resilience analyses to provide an all-encompassing comprehension of the integrated PDNs and DHNs’ resilience. The proposed framework is validated through co-simulation of a modified IEEE 33-bus PDN and a 32-node DHN, employing analytical and empirical methodologies. The results indicate that the strategic implementation of backup flexibility resources, when synchronized with DHN service provision, can enhance DHN service continuity by up to 29%, while concurrently reducing the full recovery time by nearly 41%. Dynamic resilience analyses are further conducted in DIgSILENT PowerFactory to evaluate the real-time transient response under top-ranked contingency scenarios.},

Unlike existing results, we consider a more general system with both multiple dynamic leaders and unknown covariance. The control input of each agent system depends only on the states of its neighbors and its local states. When dealing with unknown time-varying covariance, we do not need to know its bound but use a proper estimation. Then, by using the backstepping design method, an adaptive law and a distributed adaptive tracking controller are designed. Using stochastic analysis and graph theory, it is proved that the outputs of the followers converge exponentially to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the dynamic leaders under the condition that all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the tracking error is tunable. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility of the design scheme through numerical simulation.},

In order to overcome the unknown mathematical model of the system and enhance the ability of consensus control of LSNH-MASs, a model-free adaptive hierarchical resilient cloud control (MFAHRCC) strategy, only using input and output data, is proposed. This strategy can reduce the negative impact of the DCA-DoS attacks by designing a compensation factor. The stability and consensus of LSNH-MASs in insecure network environment are strictly proved. Under the constructed cloud control framework, the computation burden of all agents is borne by the cloud controller, which not only improves the ability of real-time processing data of the system but also greatly reduces the hardware cost of agents.

  abstract     = {The piecewise and discontinuous output constraints are prevalent in practical engineering systems but remain insufficiently explored in the literature. Unlike existing results, the discontinuous constraints considered here exhibit two salient characteristics: 1) the bounded constraint boundary function undergoes a jump discontinuity at a specific instant during the initial operational period and 2) the system output becomes unconstrained thereafter. These features render traditional methods inadequate because the derivatives of the constraint boundary function do not exist. To address this problem, we propose a systematic neuroadaptive control framework for nonlinear systems that integrates two novel shift functions with a new barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). The presented control scheme not only ensures good tracking performance under such piecewise and discontinuous output constraints but also can be applied to several other common yet critical constraint scenarios without involving any adjustment to the controller structure. Theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The shadowed set, as a three-way approximation model for a fuzzy set, has been extensively studied in model construction, theoretical analysis, data analysis, and applications. However, the current research on the construction of a shadowed set is all based on a single attribute to complete the approximate partition of a simple target concept, i.e., single-granularity-layer space. Multiple attributes are not considered comprehensively to achieve an approximate partition of the complex target concept, i.e., multigranularity-layer space. In addition, the current evaluation criteria of the shadowed set are all reasonable explanations for model construction and threshold determination, lacking an effective evaluation of approximate partition results. Therefore, the multigranularity-layer shadowed set (MGLSS) is proposed in this article, which aims to extend the construction of the shadowed set from single-granularity-layer space to multigranularity-layer space. First, MGLSS is analyzed based on information systems and divided into two models: optimistic-MGLSS (OPT-MGLSS) and pessimistic-MGLSS (PES-MGLSS). Second, the expression form, threshold selection, semantic interpretation, partition rules, basic mathematical theorems, and the definition of fusion operators of MGLSS are analyzed and discussed. Third, two evaluation criteria of coverage and accuracy of approximate partition results are proposed. Finally, six cases are analyzed to illustrate the application scenarios of MGLSS, and one instance and algorithm analysis are given to demonstrate the construction steps, and through the real datasets experiment and statistical hypothesis testing analysis, to provide an objective and quantitative scientific basis for the research conclusion. The experimental results demonstrate the validity and rationality of the MGLSS construction mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Role-based collaboration (RBC) is an emerging and advanced methodology for problem-solving. A critical aspect of RBC theory is agent evaluation, which aims to assess agents’ abilities through a qualification value derived from a comprehensive analysis of their characteristics. This evaluation directly impacts the quality of role assignments. Existing research typically assumes that the qualification value is either predetermined, based on multiscale criteria, or following a predefined distribution. These assumptions, however, are overly idealistic and difficult to generalize, failing to capture the inherent volatility of the qualification value. To address this challenge, this article introduces a Wasserstein-based ambiguity set to model potential fluctuations in the qualification value, drawing on empirical distributions derived from historical sample data. Building upon the RBC framework and its abstract model environments, classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO), we propose two data-driven models: distributionally robust group role assignment (DRGRA) and group multirole assignment (DRGMRA). These models aim to achieve more robust and optimal role assignments under uncertainty in agent evaluation. Leveraging strong duality, we reformulate DRGRA and DRGMRA as tractable finite mixed 0–1 convex problems, providing an approximation framework that reduces computational complexity. Notably, these models are adaptable to other problems with no uncertainty in agent evaluation, highlighting their modeling scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.},

To overcome this challenge, a two-layer control architecture is proposed. At the control layer, an integral sliding-mode controller is developed to mitigate the impact of bias faults, and an adaptive estimation mechanism is incorporated to identify the fault parameters. At the decision-making layer, performance index functions for both the pursuers and the evader are formulated based on the PE state error and their respective control strategies, and optimal pursuit and evasion strategies are derived by solving the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Furthermore, adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed, with each participant using a critic network to approximate the optimal strategies for the pursuers and the evader. The proposed control mechanism is theoretically proven to ensure that all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded, allowing the faulty pursuers to successfully capture the evader.

Then, based on the observer and two nonlinear estimators, a fully distributed controller is developed. Communication among neighboring agents is governed by a hybrid triggering mechanism (HTM) that integrates both time-triggered and event-triggered conditions. Notably, the proposed strategy ensures a positive minimum triggering interval (PMTI). The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a single-link flexible joint manipulator.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel adaptive second-order sliding mode (ASOSM) control law is constructed for a general category of sliding mode control (SMC) systems with mismatched uncertainties, including a nonvanishing external disturbance. This innovative control design proposal is accomplished through three key mechanisms. First, the new sliding mode dynamics subject to mismatched uncertainties is derived by selecting the appropriate sliding variables, which can significantly increase the uncertainties existing in the control input channel and relax the strict requirement on the relative degree assumption of the sliding variable. Second, a novel ASOSM controller, which contains some adaptive parameters generated via a three-layer nested adaptive mechanism, is constructed by utilizing the modified adding power integrator (API) approach and the adaptive control technique. Third, the practical finite-time stability of the closed-loop sliding mode system is confirmed by means of the systematic Lyapunov stability theory. The technical advancement of the developed adaptive control scheme lies in its ability to effectively deal with a more general sliding mode dynamics containing multiple uncertainties and guarantee that the practical second-order sliding mode (SOSM) is established in a finite time. Finally, simulation results, incorporating a practical application case, are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed adaptive control scheme.},

The proposed filter is systematically derived through the integration of a disturbance observer (DOB) design and a high-order pole–zero cancellation (PZC) technique, yielding the following contributions. First, a double-integral, offset-free position filter reduces the order of the filtering error dynamics by employing nonlinearly parameterized gains. Second, the combination of the DOB-based system with these gains facilitates the design of speed and acceleration filters based on filtered position measurements. Third, the diagonalization of the filtering error dynamics via nonlinear gain parameterization simplifies the tuning process for desired performance. The experimental validation using a 500-W brushless dc motor-based dynamometer demonstrates a 27% improvement in feedback system performance compared to a well-tuned extended state observer (ESO).},

We prove that in a duplex network with identical structures, superdiffusion cannot occur under one-to-one interlayer connections. In addition, we prove that the dissimilarity of the Fiedler vector significantly enhances the network superdiffusion performance, which can lead to superdiffusion when selecting nodes with differential eigenvector components in the Fiedler vector for interlayer connections. We also prove that the upper bound of network diffusion with interlayer crossing-connections is limited by the maximum difference of the eigenvector components in the Fiedler vector.

Using the spanning tree tool present in graph theory, we develop a spanning tree-induced method (SPIM) to induce the weight vectors from preference information. The essence of this method is to extract all possible “key combinations” from an FPR and then compute all possible weight vectors. The arithmetic mean (AM) and geometric mean (GM) of these weight vectors are the overall weight vectors of the FPR. Based on the accumulation of squared deviations between the overall weight vector and all possible weight vectors, we define a new measure of inconsistency. The SPIM exhibits three essential characteristics; this method not only produces all possible weight vectors but also identifies their sources. Consequently, this approach can further facilitate the inconsistency analysis, and this method can be directly applied to incomplete FPRs without estimating missing elements. Additionally, we prove the mathematical equivalence of the GM of weight vectors derived from all spanning trees to that of the logarithmic least-squares method (LLSM). Without loss of generality, we adopt the Monte Carlo simulations and report a comparison analysis to provide strong evidence for the advantages and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This framework utilizes a conditional generative model to pretrain a comprehensive and generalizable skill repository from heterogeneous datasets, facilitating skill inference across diverse contexts. This strategy enhances transferability to novel tasks, thereby minimizing the need for extensive, task-specific training. Subsequently, a concise set of task-specific demonstrations is employed to guide the selection process, allowing the model to efficiently sample relevant skills from the pre-existing skill repository, which effectively reduces the exploration space. This approach accelerates the acquisition of highly effective policies tailored for task completion.

Furthermore, cooperative game theory is introduced to find optimal solutions. To guarantee the system’s stability and antidisturbance capabilities, robust compensation control and terminal constraints are designed.

We propose elastic PFL (EPFL), an EPFL framework that accommodates dynamic client participation while preserving model performance. Our framework addresses two fundamental challenges: 1) seamlessly generating personalized models for newly joining unlabeled clients and 2) achieving efficient and precise multigrain unlearning for quitting clients. To address these challenges, we utilize hypernetworks for client-specific model generation and introduce a novel client embedding regularization (CER) to enhance generalization capabilities for new clients. Furthermore, we design an adversarial purification mechanism that enables efficient multigrained unlearning at the client, sample, and class levels. We provide theoretical analysis establishing both generalization bounds for new clients and convergence guarantees for the unlearning process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EPFL outperforms the existing PFL methods in terms of both accuracy and generalization capabilities. Through backdoor trigger experiments, we show that EPFL achieves unlearning efficacy and fidelity comparable to complete retraining while requiring only 3%–10% of the computational time of these existing approaches.},

But obtaining a good model is the crucial and difficult part. Originally, the classical diagnosis algorithms were developed to analyze Boolean circuits, such that simple propositional or predicate logic models were sufficient to express the structure and behavior. Cyber–physical systems, however, exhibit hybrid behavior, meaning they generate continuous and discrete values that need to be interpreted. This adds significant complexity. Furthermore, modern cyber–physical systems may change their structure over their lifetime and thus require model adaptations. This article presents a novel formalism to model cyber–physical systems for consistency-based fault diagnosis. Drawing from the research fields of artificial intelligence and control theory, the approach models system structure and behavior through the use of satisfiability modulo nonlinear arithmetic. The approach proves advantageous compared to previous modeling techniques through its integration of nonlinear behavior models, implicit computation of residual values to compute fault symptoms, its representation of different operating modes of the system, and its integration with existing sound and complete fault diagnosis algorithms. The approach was validated empirically using two benchmarks from the process industry, a simulation of battery packs, and Boolean standard circuits. Throughout all experiments, an accuracy of 97% was achieved.},

To improve efficiency and robustness, a novel dual-channel event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is developed to reduce redundant data transmissions. Furthermore, a dynamic memory-based ETM (DMETM) is proposed, where traditional static error coefficients are replaced with system-dependent dynamic coefficients, constructed using historical triggering data. This reduces conservatism and ensures better adaptability during transient and steady-state phases, while effectively avoiding Zeno behavior. To tackle the membership function (MF) mismatch problem caused by event-triggered (ET) transmissions, equations incorporating MF information are introduced to establish connections between mismatched MFs. A real-time gray wolf optimizer (GWO)-based strategy, enhanced with local search techniques, is introduced to automatically optimize the controller’s MF parameters, thus overcoming the limitations of manual, experience-based MF design. Compared to conventional controllers relying on expert subjective knowledge or intuition, this method offers superior transient performance and tolerance to unmodeled errors in the system. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in terms of transient behavior, disturbance attenuation, and resource conservation compared to conventional methods. The proposed framework offers a practical and scalable solution for IT2 fuzzy controller design in resource-constrained networked systems.},

The study assessed whether these modes influence operators’ cognitive workload, situational awareness (SA), and task performance. The task involved two LoA conditions: teleoperation (low LoA) and remote monitoring (high LoA), while participants simultaneously performed a secondary task. Task performance was measured through completion time, collision rates, time spent in low LoA, and secondary task performance. Operator-related measures included workload National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), trust, ease of use, and perceived SA. The results revealed a clear tradeoff between operational efficiency and situational awareness. The RI mode improved task efficiency and reduced workload but compromised SA, whereas HI mode enhanced SA at the cost of efficiency. These findings highlight the inherent tension between automation-driven performance gains and operator’s cognitive engagement.

  abstract     = {This article studies the two-dimensional (2-D) rectangle packing area minimization problem (RPAMP), a key subproblem in floor planning for very large-scale integration (VLSI) chip design. The goal of RPAMP is to orthogonally pack a set of rectangles into a variable-sized rectangular container without overlap, while minimizing the area of the container. By transforming the original problem into a series of 2-D strip packing problems (2DSPs), we propose a two-stage adaptive search algorithm (TS-ASA) to tackle the RPAMP. TS-ASA incorporates several distinctive features: First, a new candidate width pruning strategy is introduced, which limits the number of rectangles used for width combinations, thus reducing the search space. Second, the packing process is divided into two stages, with distinct scoring rules for each stage to optimize space utilization. Additionally, a multirestart strategy is employed to identify the appropriate switching point for the scoring rules. Tested on 39 public benchmark instances and compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms, TS-ASA improves the best-known solutions for 27 instances and matches the best results for two instances. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TS-ASA.},

  abstract     = {As a generalized model of Dempster–Shafer’s evidence theory, complex evidence theory (CET) has the ability to express uncertainty and reasoning uncertainty. One of the key problems in CET is how to model uncertain information in CET by means of complex basic belief assignment (CBBA). Therefore, this article proposes an uncertainty modeling method to generate CBBA using the reinforced triangular fuzzy number (TFN) function. The proposed RTFN-nps-based uncertainty method can extract feature information from the data source by taking advantage of the decomposition of complex numbers. In addition, based on the proposed CBBA generation method, a reinforced TFN-based multisource information fusion (RTFN-MSIF) method is designed for decision-making. Finally, the RTFN-MSIF method is applied to the pattern classification to verify its effectiveness. In conclusion, the RTFN-MSIF method can deal with uncertainty modeling and reasoning in both real and complex domains, and provides a promising method for decision theory.},

  abstract     = {A flexible job-shop scheduling problem with lot streaming (FJSP-LS) is an extension of flexible job-shop scheduling problems (FJSPs). In it, jobs are allowed to be split into multiple sublots for separate/concurrent processing and transportation, thereby improving job-shop productivity. However, it faces a drastically enlarged solution space due to such sublot splitting, which makes it challenging to find its optimal solution. In this study, a reinforcement-learning-enhanced knowledge-guided genetic algorithm (RKGA) is proposed to solve it. In particular, we design a knowledge-guided strategy that extracts sublot features from sublot schemes (SSs) of an elite solution set as knowledge. This knowledge is then used to guide the SS mutation and state-space generation of the environment in reinforcement learning (RL). Moreover, a method combining perturbation operations and RL is designed to help the algorithm escape from local optima. Extensive computational experiments have been carried out, and the results validate the superiority of RKGA over the state-of-the-art algorithms in solving FJSP-LS.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a distributed event-triggered control approach that integrates a partial time-interval error constraint (PTIEC) for multirobot cooperative manipulation of a shared object. Considering the scenario where only a subset of robots possesses accurate information regarding the positions (orientations) and corresponding velocities of the object’s desired local trajectory, a novel dual-layer control framework is established, comprising an estimation (first) layer and an actuation (second) layer. In the estimation layer, the desired local trajectory is estimated by means of the novel distributed prescribed-time estimators without the undesirable infinite gain issue. In the actuation layer, a stretching function is introduced and integrated with the barrier function to facilitate the error constraints within some partial time intervals (occurring at a noninitial moment), effectively converting the constrained system into a “constraint-free” one. Then, a distributed event-triggered control law is constructed, taking into account the unknown dynamics of both the robots and the manipulated object, as well as communication delays. The communication and actuation are executed at specific event times, thus alleviating the burden of control updates and communication costs of the robot system. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dual-layer control technique are confirmed through simulations.},
