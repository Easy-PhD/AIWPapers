  abstract     = {Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has gained significant attention due to its ability to facilitate collaborative model training without relying on a central server. However, it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious participants can manipulate model updates to embed hidden functionalities. In this paper, we propose BaDFL, a novel Backdoor Attack defense mechanism for Decentralized Federated Learning. BaDFL enhances robustness by applying strategic model clipping at the local update level. To the best of our knowledge, BaDFL is the first decentralized federated learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees against model poisoning attacks. Specifically, BaDFL achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nT}})$, where n is the number of nodes and T is the global maximum iteration number. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis under two different attack scenarios, showing that BaDFL maintains robustness within a specific defense radius. Extensive experimental results show that, on average, BaDFL can effectively defend against model poisoning within 6 mitigation rounds, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy.},

Additionally, it employs a transformer-based estimator to guide efficient workload mappings.

VDS also allows to efficiently replace the outsourced data by another value. However, the old authentication information can make the expired data pass the verification. To prevent this attack, VDS schemes must provide a revocation approach to revoke the old authentication information. The current approach employs the tree-like authentication structure or cryptographic accumulator, which will influence the efficiency of the VDS scheme. In this work, we find an approach to construct the low-storage VDS scheme supporting efficient revocation. Towards this end, we fully exploit the property of chameleon hash function with ephemeral trapdoor to propose a signature, which is the crucial step to construct the VDS scheme. In our VDS scheme, the size of the authentication information can be reduced to be less than the scale of the data streaming (i.e., low storage). Furthermore, the client is able to revoke the old authentication information in an efficient manner, where she only needs to release a message (i.e., efficient revocation). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VDS scheme is efficient and practical.},

  abstract     = {The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1Ã— inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.},

To protect the confidentiality of sensitive information outsourced to cloud servers, much efforts have been devoted to designing geometric range query schemes over encrypted spatial data without affecting availability. However, existing works focus on the privacy-preserving schemes with traditional tree indexes, causing more computing and storage issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient conjunctive geometric range query scheme over encrypted spatial data with a learned index. In particular, we design a new privacy-preserving learned index for spatial data to reduce the search space and storage overhead. The main idea is to add noise disturbance to the objective function instead of directly adding it to output results, reducing the leakage of private information and ensuring the correctness of output results. Moreover, we propose a spatial segmentation algorithm to avoid accessing a large number of unnecessary Z codes in the query process. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme ensures index data security and query privacy. Simulation results show that the query efficiency is improved while the storage overhead is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

We present STAGEWISE, an CPU-efficient key-value store on fast NVMe SSDs with high throughput. To achieve this, we introduce a new thread model for StageWise to process KV requests. Specifically, STAGEWISE converts the processing of each KV request into multiple asynchronous stages, and thus enables pipelining across all stages. STAGEWISE further introduces a client-driven share-index architecture to ease inter-thread load imbalance and maximize the pipelining opportunity. Guided by Littleâ€™s Law, STAGEWISE improves concurrency, and therefore efficiently uses CPU to reach higher throughput. Extensive experimental results show that STAGEWISE outperforms CPUoptimized key-value stores (e.g., KVell) by up to 3.5Ã— with writeintensive workloads, and storage-optimized ones (e.g., RocksDB) by over an order of magnitude. STAGEWISE also shows higher read performance and excellent scalability under various workloads.},

  abstract     = {Sorting operations are considered to be a significant part of any computer system and are widely used in many applications. In applications where sorting has to be efficiently accomplished (i.e., in O(1) time) on small-sized entries, hardware accelerators, such as ASICs, FPGAs, or GPUs, are used to speed up the sorting operations. In the literature, the bitonic sort algorithm (or variants thereof) is still considered to be the most commonly used approach in many hardware sort implementations for decades. However, the time complexity of the bitonic sort is O((log(n))2) for sorting n elements, which does not satisfy the constant-time constraint we demand for our setting. In this paper, we propose competition-style sorting networks (CSNs), a framework for designing hardware-based competition-style class of sorting networks that captures all forms of two-stage sorting networks where the first stage (competition) consists of pairwise comparisons and the second stage (evaluation) ranks the entries and sorts them. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we develop and test one instance of this design, called the Competition Sort Algorithm (CSA), which has a time complexity of O(1), and specifically, one clock cycle. We implemented and tested CSA on both an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and the NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU then measured its gain, which combines the trade-offs between the relative speedup and the relative area increase, against the bitonic sort. Our results show that the CSA achieves a significant gain of up to 11.01Ã— on the FPGA and a relative speedup of up to 3.32Ã— on the GPU. We also compare the area, power, and latency of CSA with the bitonic sort algorithm on the FPGA.},

  abstract     = {Embodied carbon is the carbon emissions in the manufacturing process of products, which dominates the overall carbon footprint in many industries. Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g. 28nm CPU, whereas a product instance can be made in various regions and time periods. Carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a product instance can differ from its product class. Additionally, different carbon attribution methods (e.g., location-based and market-based) can affect the carbon emissions of electricity, thus further affecting the embodied carbon of products. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) accounting models with dual attribution methods. We observe significant differences between STEC and current models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference is 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) training and LLM inference. We observe that using STEC results in much greater differences in the embodied carbon of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%).},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by training models on edge client devices using their local data without revealing their raw data. In edge environments, various applications require different neural network models, making it crucial to perform joint training of multiple models on edge devices, known as multi-task FL. While existing multi-task FL approaches enhance resource utilization on edge devices through adaptive resource configuration or client selection, optimizing either of these aspects alone may lead to suboptimality. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a joint client selection and resource configuration method called JCSRC for multi-task FL, aiming to maximize energy efficiency in environments with limited computation and communication resources and heterogeneous client devices. Firstly, we formalize this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem considering all these characteristics and prove its NP-hardness. To address this problem, we first design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based client selection method that selects appropriate clients for each task to train their models. The MARL method makes client selection decisions based on the clientsâ€™ data quality, energy efficiency, communication, and computation capacity to ensure fast convergence and energy efficiency. Then, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based resource configuration scheme that configures appropriate computation and bandwidth resources for each task on each client. The PSO scheme makes resource configuration decisions based on theoretically derived optimal CPU frequency and bandwidth to achieve high energy efficiency. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments to validate our proposed JCSRC. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, JCSRC can save energy consumption by up to 59% to achieve the target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance demands and stringent timing requirements of safety-critical systems like avionics and autonomous vehicles, research has focused on providing timing guarantees for the scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks in multicore systems. The structural complexity and timing anomalies make this problem challenging. Existing methods bound the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks through static analysis, but these bounds are complicated, difficult to validate, and often remain pessimistic for many scheduling scenarios. Runtime intervention can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is ineffective for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leads to non-work-conserving schedules, and incurs additional overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to identify timing anomalies in DAG scheduling scenarios within a system, providing tighter WCRT solutions. The static analysis first offers a sufficient anomaly test to directly identify some anomaly-free DAG scheduling scenarios. Leveraging a wide range of scheduling data collected from the running system or its simulator, we then apply a machine learning approach to train a binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of 99.5%. Identifying the anomaly status enables the application of more precise WCRT bounds for different scheduling scenarios, leading to improved system performance. Specifically, we shorten the WCRT bounds for anomaly-free DAG scheduling by an average of up to 21.58%, with a maximum reduction of up to 55.47% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {RowHammer poses a serious reliability challenge to modern DRAM systems. As technology scales down, DRAM resistance to RowHammer has decreased by 30Ã— over the past decade, causing an increasing number of benign applications to suffer from this issue. However, existing defense mechanisms have three limitations: 1) they rely on inefficient mitigation techniques, such as time-consuming victim row refresh; 2) they do not reduce the number of effective RowHammer attacks, leading to frequent mitigations; and 3) they fail to recognize that frequently accessed data is not only a root cause of RowHammer but also presents an opportunity for performance optimization. In this paper, we observe that frequently accessed hot data plays a distinct role in security and efficiency: it can induce RowHammer by interfering with adjacent cold data, while also being performance-critical due to its frequent accesses. To this end, we propose Data Isolation via In-DRAM Cache (DIVIDE), a novel defense mechanism that leverages in-DRAM cache to isolate and exploit hot data. DIVIDE offers three key benefits: 1) It reduces the number of effective RowHammer attacks, as hot data in the cache cannot interfere with each other. 2) It provides a simple yet effective mitigation measure by isolating hot data from cold data. 3) It caches frequently accessed hot data, improving average access latency. DIVIDE employs a two-level protection structure: the first level mitigates RowHammer in cache arrays with high efficiency, while the second level addresses the remaining threats in normal arrays to ensure complete protection. Owing to the high in-DRAM cache hit rate, DIVIDE efficiently mitigates RowHammer while preserving both the performance and energy efficiency of the in-DRAM cache. At a RowHammer threshold of 128, DIVIDE with probabilistic mitigation achieves an average performance improvement of 19.6% and energy savings of 20.4% over DDR4 DRAM for fourcore workloads. Compared to an unprotected in-DRAM cache DRAM, DIVIDE incurs only a 2.1% performance overhead while requiring just a modest 1KB per-channel CAM in the memory controller, with no modification to the DRAM chip.},

  abstract     = {Abstractâ€”Asynchronous common subset (ACS) is a powerful paradigm enabling applications such as Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) and multi-party computation (MPC). The most efficient ACS framework in the information-theoretic setting is due to Ben-Or, Kelmer, and Rabin (BKR, 1994). The BKR ACS protocol has been both theoretically and practically impactful. BKR ACS has an O(log $n$) running time (where $n$ is the number of replicas) due to the usage of $n$ parallel asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances, impacting both performance and scalability. Indeed, for a network of 16âˆ¼64 replicas, the parallel ABA phase occupies about 95%âˆ¼97% of the total runtime. A long-standing open problem is whether we can build an ACS framework with O(1) time while not increasing the message or communication complexity of the BKR protocol. We resolve the open problem, presenting the first constant-time ACS protocol with O($n$3) messages in the information-theoretic and signature-free settings. Our key ingredient is the first information-theoretic and constant-time multivalued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol. Our results can improveßžasymptotically and concretelyßžvarious applications using ACS and MVBA. As an example, we implement FIN, a BFT protocol instantiated using our framework. Via a 121-server deployment on Amazon EC2, we show FIN reduces the overhead of the ABA phase to as low as 1.23% of the total runtime.},

  abstract     = {To achieve seamless portability across the embedded computing continuum, we introduce a new kernel architecture: fluid kernels. Fluid kernels can be thought of as the intersection between embedded unikernels and general purpose monolithic kernels, allowing to seamlessly develop applications both in kernel space and user space in a unified way. This scalable kernel architecture can manage the trade-off between performance, code size, isolation and security. We compare our fluid kernel implementation, Miosix, to Linux and FreeRTOS on the same hardware with standard benchmarks. Compared to Linux, we achieve an average speedup of 3.5Ã— and a maximum of up to 15.4Ã—. We also achieve an average code size reduction of 84% and a maximum of up to 90%. By moving application code from user space to kernel space, an additional code size reduction up to 56% and a speedup up to 1.3Ã— can be achieved. Compared to FreeRTOS, the use of Miosix only costs a moderate amount of code size (at most 47KB) for significant advantages in application performance with speedups averaging at 1.5Ã— and up to 5Ã—.},

  abstract     = {Graph partitioning as a classic NP-complete problem, is the most fundamental procedure that needs to be performed before parallel computations. Partitioners can be divided into vertex- and edge-based approaches. Recently, both approaches are employing a streaming heuristic to find approximate solutions. It is lightweight in space and time complexities, but suffers from suboptimal partitioning quality, especially for directed graphs where the explicit knowledge provided for heuristic is limited. This paper thereby proposes new heuristics for not only vertex-based but also edge-based partitioning. They improve quality by additionally utilizing implicit knowledge, which is embedded in the local streaming view and the global graph view. Memory reduction techniques are presented to extract this knowledge with negligible space costs. That preserves the lightweight advantages of streaming partitioning. Besides, we study parallel acceleration and restreaming, to further boost the partitioning efficiency and quality. Extensive experiments validate that our proposals outperform the state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {Erasure coding has been extensively deployed in todayâ€™s commodity HPC systems against unexpected failures. To adapt to the varying access characteristics and reliability demands, storage clusters have to perform redundancy transitioning via tuning the coding parameters, which unfortunately gives rise to substantial transitioning traffic. We present ElasticEC, a fast and elastic redundancy transitioning approach for erasure-coded clusters. ElasticEC first minimizes the transitioning traffic via proposing a relocation-aware stripe reorganization mechanism and a collecting-and-encoding algorithm. It further heuristically balances the transitioning traffic across nodes. We implement ElasticEC in Hadoop HDFS and conduct extensive experiments on a real-world cloud storage cluster, showing that ElasticEC can reduce 71.1-92.6% of the transitioning traffic and shorten 65.9-90.7% of the transitioning time.},
