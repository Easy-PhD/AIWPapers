  abstract     = {Multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) on social media is a challenging task that uses corresponding images to aid in recognizing entities in short and noisy texts. Most existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks: weak image-text semantic correlation and the hybridity of entity types in intermodality alignment. To this end, a general framework ProMNER is proposed for unimodal and multimodal NER tasks, which includes text-driven visual-modality enhancement (TVE) and prompt-guided type-related refinement and interaction (PTRI). Specifically, to alleviate the bias caused by irrelevant visual content, TVE employs cross-modal translation to generate visual representations that replace the original ones. Furthermore, the generated can serve directly as an additional input modality for NER, enabling the framework to be generalized to unimodal and multimodal NER tasks. Subsequently, to tackle the hybridity problem of intermodality entity alignment, type-filled question prompts are designed as guidance information to explicitly refine type-related visual representations. PTRI obtains type-specific multimodal representations by capturing semantic intermodality interactions for each type, and learns a comprehensive multimodal representation through dynamic weighting. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and generality of ProMNER in unimodal and multimodal NER tasks.},

  abstract     = {Involution, characterized by intensified competition for limited social resources without generating additional societal value, has become a critical issue in modern social systems. This study aims to investigate effective mechanisms to mitigate involution by incorporating other-regarding preferences (ORP) into evolutionary game dynamics on complex networks and in well-mixed populations. Through numerical simulations conducted on square lattices and small-world networks, we systematically analyze the combined effects of crucial parameters including total social resources, the cost of more effort, fairness in resource distribution, and the intensity of ORP on the evolutionary dynamics of involution. Our findings reveal that increasing social resources generally exacerbates involution, whereas greater fairness in resource distribution alleviates it. Notably, the influence of more effort costs on involution is nonlinear and context-dependent, modulated by the interaction between resource abundance and ORP intensity. Critically, ORP emerges as a decisive factor: stronger ORP substantially suppresses involution, promotes the emergence and spatial stability of cooperative clusters, and reduces the equilibrium proportion of defectors. Theoretical analysis based on replicator dynamics validate our simulation results, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for the observed phenomena. This study not only advances the theoretical understanding of involution dynamics but also offers practical insights for addressing involution in real-world social systems. It highlights the importance of cultivating altruistic social norms and ensuring fairness in resource allocation to effectively mitigate involution.},

  abstract     = {With the deep integration of wearable devices and information technology, health data collection has become more efficient and accurate. This has brought about significant changes to health management and public health. However, due to the high sensitivity and privacy of health data, data sharing faces major challenges. Most existing studies focus on encryption algorithms and access control to ensure data security. They often ignore the credibility of data providers, which affects data quality and reduces user participation. To address these issues, this article proposes a blockchain-based and reputation-enhanced health data trading model. A fine-grained reputation value calculation method based on the Beta distribution is introduced to objectively evaluate the behavior of data providers. Based on this, a consensus mechanism linked to reputation value is designed to improve consensus efficiency and avoid centralization of node selection. Furthermore, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the reward and punishment mechanism in the trading process. It explores the dynamic balance between platform cost and user willingness to share. Experimental results show that the model ensures secure health data sharing, while effectively improving data usability, system fairness, and user participation.},

This study analyzes user behavior across six platforms over 33 years, exploring how the size of conversations and communities influences dialogue dynamics. Our findings reveal that smaller platforms foster richer, more sustained interactions, while larger platforms drive broader but shorter participation. Moreover, we observe that the propensity for users to reengage in a conversation decreases as community size grows, with niche environments as a notable exception, where participation remains robust. These findings show an interdependence between platform architecture, user engagement, and community dynamics, shedding light on how digital ecosystems shape the structure and quality of public discourse.},

While much research focuses on differentiating false rumors from authentic information, identifying the source of misinformation is critical to halting its dissemination. This work introduces a novel deep learning framework for rumor source detection, employing a hybrid technique with oversampling and weighted dynamic loss estimation to address imbalanced node classification in large networks. Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on network topology or diffusion patterns, our model integrates user motives, topic interests through keyword template-based topic distribution, and influence metrics within communities. Combining these with rumor propagation statistics, structural characteristics, and neighborhood connectivity provides a robust input to the graph neural network (GNN) model. Experiments on three real-world social media datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving an average F1-score of 0.92. An extensive ablation study further highlights the significance of user characteristics in improving rumor source detection.},

Nevertheless, existing approaches predominantly rely on a single augmentation strategy to construct contrastive views, often failing to effectively balance feature perturbation with semantic preservation. To overcome this limitation, we propose motif-guided multiview contrastive learning (MMCL), a unified framework for contrastive augmentation. MMCL leverages diverse view generation strategies across the user–item bipartite graph and the KG, perturbing graph structures while preserving essential semantics to the greatest extent possible. Specifically, for collaborative signals, we devise a data augmentation mechanism to model the interaction dynamics between users and items. For semantic information, we introduce a novel graph augmentation technique by constructing an interactive motif KG, enabling semantic contrastive learning within localized views. Furthermore, joint enhancement of graph and interaction data allows the model to capture global topological features of nodes. MMCL integrates contrastive learning at both local and global levels, effectively embedding local semantics and global topology into the learned representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets reveal that MMCL outperforms advanced methods, particularly in scenarios with sparse interactions and noisy KG, while significantly alleviating popularity bias in recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning, as an efficient unsupervised learning, has been extensively studied for improving graph neural network (GNN) in graph-structured data mining. With the wider application of GNN, recent work has revealed that it is vulnerable toward privacy leakage (e.g., property inference). How dose contrastive learning influence privacy leakage of GNN? To address the issue, for the first time we comprehensively evaluate the privacy leakage of contrastive learning for GNN. Specifically, we conduct property inference attack on GNN and evaluate the leakage from the perspective of graph augmentation, encoders, negative sampling and privacy preservation on seven graph contrastive learning (GCL) models with five datasets. Based on extensive experiments, several important insights are gained. 1) Contrastive learning will make GNN more vulnerable to property inference attack than supervised GNNs, e.g., the inference accuracy on GCL models is $\boldsymbol{\times\sim}$1.42 of that of supervised GNNs. 2) The strategy of node augmentation in contrastive learning will make the property of the graph easier to steal among all strategies, e.g., it achieves average inference accuracy (ACC) of 83.89% on the node augmentation. 3) Negative sampling based on rationale-aware will lead to easier leakage of graph properties than other strategies, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack is 100% when using rationale-aware. 4) The better performance results of the graph encoder, the more privacy leakage of the graph property, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack reaches 83.89% on average, and reaches 84.40% when GIN is used as the encoder. 5) The simpler the structure of the graph, the more vulnerable its graph properties are, i.e., the AIDS dataset achieved the highest ACC of 90.96 with the simplest structure. 6) Existing privacy-preserving methods for supervised GNN are deficient for GCL, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack after defence maintains 96% of the nondefensive ones. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analyze of the reasons behind these observations for better understanding of robust contrastive learning for GNN.},

However, current MI recognition approaches primarily utilize complex attention modules for higher recognition accuracy, consequently hindering real-time BCI implementation. Furthermore, existing methods often overlook inter-subject variability, leading to inadequate generalization of model. Additionally, traditional BCI systems lack closed-loop feedback from the machine to the brain. To address these limitations, we develop a novel closed-loop motor imagery BCI system, which encompasses a spectral-temporal refined attention network via contrastive mutual learning (STRA-CML) and a brain-controlled perceived hand exoskeleton. Specifically, we first design a spectral temporal refined attention block to capture the most discriminative spectral and temporal features. Second, we investigate a contrastive mutual learning strategy incorporating supervised-contrastive learning to enhance the generalization of our STRA-CML. Finally, a brain–machine closed-loop interaction platform based on perceived hand exoskeleton is developed to validate the feasibility of the proposed STRA-CML and provide kinesthetic and visual feedback synchronized with MI. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our STRA-CML, indicating that our STRA-CML achieves superior classification performance of 83.89% on BCI IV 2a dataset, 86.93% on BCI IV 2b dataset, and 82.79% on self-collected dataset.},
