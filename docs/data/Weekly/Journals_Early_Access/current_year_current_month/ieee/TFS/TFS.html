  abstract     = {The ambiguity and incompleteness of electric vehicle (EV) user behavior preferences, as well as the uncertainty of randomly arriving EV charging demands, pose significant challenges for the scheduling of an EV charging station (EVCS). To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) information. The IVIF information excels at capturing the dynamic and ambiguous nature of user preferences. An interpretable quantitative evaluation method based on IVIF is proposed to provide reliable prior knowledge for decision-making. The novel reward functions account for both group and individual characteristics, achieving a balance in their timely responses. In order to solve the problem of mixed-integer second-order cone and semidefinite programming (MI-SOCSDP) with sparse uncertain data, an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) is developed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the consistency between the charging/discharging decision-making processes and users' fuzzy preferences. Moreover, the proposed method minimizes the worst-case expected cost over the ambiguity sets of probability distributions, effectively verifying the robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {Single image dehazing has been extensively studied. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven notable progress in single image dehazing, their performance remains fundamentally constrained by the limited local receptive fields of convolutional operations, which impede the capture of global structural dependencies. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image synthesis, offering global insights into structure, texture, and color. The fuzzy prior, a probabilistic knowledge acquired through adversarial training in GANs, plays a pivotal role in robust dehazing. Motivated by this, we propose the fuzzy prior guided dehazing network (FPGDN). Our framework begins with a novel module that distills the fuzzy prior by translating an edge map into a color image, simultaneously capturing global structural, local textural, and color information. Subsequently, a dehazing network is constructed, leveraging this fuzzy prior. While the fuzzy prior captures rich color and texture features, the generated images may exhibit color shifts relative to the original scene. To remedy this, a CNN network is employed to capture local nuances and refine the dehazing outcome. Extensive experiments substantiate that the proposed FPGDN achieves superior dehazing performance on a variety of real and synthetic hazy images.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory estimation for underwater gliders remains a significant challenge due to the limited observability of horizontal displacement during submerged operations. This work presents a novel hybrid framework that enhances horizontal trajectory prediction by integrating reinforcement learning (RL)-based inference with the dynamic response of a motion model via fuzzy logic fusion. A proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent is trained to generate an angle of attack (AoA) sequence that minimizes terminal displacement error, providing task-optimal guidance based on a kinematics driven transition model. To address the absence of physical constraints and the lack of detailed dynamic modeling in the RL process, a fuzzy fusion strategy is introduced. This strategy adaptively blends the RL inferred and dynamics derived AoA according to discrepancies in motion state predictions. Experimental results from indoor trials demonstrate that the proposed method achieves endpoint localization accuracy within 0.3m. Meanwhile, the fused AoA maintains strong consistency with the measured AoA sequence, with a Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence below 0.06. The proposed framework provides an adaptive and computationally efficient solution for glider localization under partial observability, highlighting the potential of fuzzy system integration in advancing data-driven autonomy for marine platforms.},

  abstract     = {The existing formation control strategies are difficult to respond quickly to the complex and ever-changing marine environment. Thus, an efficient and reliable strategy is urgently needed to meet the requirements of networked marine surface vehicles' (NMSVs) formation control under this background. This paper investigates the time-varying formation control (TVFC) problem of NMSVs subject to communication links faults and model uncertainty. A hierarchical control framework is constructed for developing the prescribed-time fuzzy control (PTFC) algorithm for NMSVs, comprising a distributed formation tracking (DFT) layer and local fuzzy control (LFC) layer. The DFT layer is responsible for ensuring that all marine surface vehicle followers estimate the expected states of the virtual leader based on human-in-the-loop (HiTL) strategy. The HiTL strategy is introduced to promptly respond to unexpected emergencies in complex marine environments. Specifically, the artificially arranged control inputs are transmitted to manipulate the virtual leader through the employment of gesture-to-formation system and further guide the navigation of NMSVs followers synchronously. The LFC layer is conducted to achieve the TVFC and cope with the model uncertainty of NMSVs by using the sliding surface and fuzzy logic system. And the tracking errors of both two layers can converge to the origin within the prescribed time. Besides, the sufficient conditions of uniform convergence and stability for the closed-loop system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability. Finally, several simulation and comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {An event refers to an occurrence under a specific topic, at a particular time and location. With the growing presence of uncertain event information, there is increasing demand for modeling fuzzy event knowledge in real-world applications. However, performing multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (EKGs) remains challenging due to the uncertainty and dynamic nature of events. Recent multi-hop reasoning methods based on knowledge graphs (KGs) have shown promise but often neglect event uncertainty and dynamics, limiting their effectiveness in fuzzy event reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel model, MFEGR, for multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (FEKGs), guided by soft logical rules. MFEGR explores logical connections among multi-hop paths in EKGs and discovers underlying soft rules governing them. Rule-based regularization is introduced to learn both temporal-causal dependencies between events and semantic relationships between events and their arguments. Additionally, we enhance event embeddings by incorporating fine-grained fuzziness into event elements and coarse-grained fuzziness into soft logic rules, improving reasoning robustness. We evaluate MFEGR on three fuzzy EKG datasets for event link prediction and multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results show that MFEGR consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.},

Granular computing (GrC), as an emerging paradigm for data handling and analysis, has significantly enhanced the performance of classification methodologies, making algorithms more robust and adaptable while simplifying complex classification issues. However, improper construction of information granules or the presence of fuzzy areas between them can diminish classification performance. To address these challenges, this article introduces the fuzzy classification based on information granule purity and granularity (FCIGPG): a novel approach that leverages maximum purity and granularity for information granulation. The method employs fuzzy approximation techniques to handle the fuzzy boundaries between granules, thereby improving the overall classification model performance. Extensive testing on real-world datasets using multiple performance metrics demonstrates the superior efficacy of FCIGPG compared to existing methods. This research opens new avenues for both theoretical advancements and practical applications of GrC in classification tasks.},

Specifically, the power index of the faulty input is no longer 1; instead, it is an odd integer greater than 1. Moreover, a novel dynamic boundary relaxation technique (DBRT) is proposed to address the fragility issue in prescribed performance control in the presence of actuator faults. The DBRT continuously monitors and evaluates the proximity between the tracking error and the prescribed performance boundary. It selectively relaxes only a single boundary when the tracking error approaches critical thresholds, effectively preventing singularity issues while minimizing the performance degradation caused by the relaxation. In addition, the prescribed performance function is redesigned to enhance its performance characteristics, including the elimination of the initial feasibility condition, the capability to specify settling time, and the reduction of both transient overshoot and steady-state error. The effectiveness of the scheme is validated through simulation results.},
