  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed fuzzy adaptive Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in noncooperative games for nonlinear multi-agent systems under unreliable communication networks. Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time-delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents' actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents' actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents' outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the non-differentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {As an important renewable energy source, photovoltaic (PV) power is widely used in power systems because of its clean, sustainable and increasingly mature technology, and ultra-short-term PV power forecasting is very important for the real-time dispatchment of power grids. However, PV power has strong periodicity and randomness, changes in weather factors such as illumination and temperature will significantly affect its power generation efficiency, which also brings challenges for PV power forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called SL-ANFIS-LSTM for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. SL-ANFIS-LSTM utilizes a structure learnable ANFIS (SL-ANFIS) module based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to characterize uncertain fuzzy factors such as weather and temperature, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module to extract the temporal dependency. Besides, physical information is also introduced to correct illegal errors caused by changes in sunlight intensity. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to related models for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting.},

  abstract     = {A large amount of work focus on static and temporal knowledge graph (KG) queries via subgraph reasoning, but it fails to consider the space-sensitivity and fuzziness of KG. Subgraph query in fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graph (f-STKG) is a fundamental and challenging task. Although a few efforts exist dedicated to f-STKG queries based on subgraph matching, they are sensitive to missing information in the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the f-STKG query method by subgraph reasoning using embeddings. The method aims to capture the semantic similarity between the query subgraph and candidate subgraph of f-STKG to accomplish subgraph matching. We first embed f-STKGs into vector space to form f-STKG vectors. Then, we construct a global subgraph of f-STKG using Composition-based Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CompGCN), which allows global information adjacent to this subgraph to be integrated. Subsequently, the query subgraph of f-STKG is constructed using mean pooling and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as the candidate subgraph of the f-STKG is constructed using CompGCN and GRU. This facilitates the integration of structural and sequence pattern information of subgraphs. Finally, we measured the semantic similarity between this query subgraph and the candidate subgraph using the subgraph matching function. In addition, we designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN's capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

This strategy can also address common uncertainties in practical systems, including communication latency, unmodeled dynamics, and external unknown disturbances. It is worth noting that the replay attack model in the paper is highly generalized. And the attack location, target, and frequency are all uncertain. Therefore, a suitable distributed memory event-based strategy (DMEBS) is designed. It can dynamically adjust the usage of historical data to optimize the release of sampled data, thereby determining when to update the control laws of each subsystem, ensuring system performance while greatly saving communication resources. In addition, the stability of the system is demonstrated by establishing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, ensuring the elimination of the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations conducted on two commonly encountered practical systems.},

Fuzzy support vector machines and their variants have demonstrated potential in handling noise and outliers but struggle to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets. To deal with this problem, in this article, we propose a novel relative density and non-membership-based intuitionistic fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning. The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel relative density and non-membership (RDNM) based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments, and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and non-linear kernels, and compare the outcomes with the existing approaches. Additionally, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models, underscoring its capability for addressing classification challenges in real-world applications with imbalanced class distributions.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative consensus reaching process (CRP) that integrates fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations (FSRs) and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships (TRs) using geometric analysis. Additionally, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree (TD), ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory (RT) with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios},

Firstly, we define cardinal consistency of fuzzy distributed preference relation (FDPR) based on additive consistency. The FDPR score calculation method satisfying additive consistency is presented. Secondly, we put forward the identification method of opinion leaders. Starting from social network and evaluation information, the concepts of authority, stability, professionalism and reliability are defined and combined to measure expert's leadership ability. Then, the multi-objective optimization model is constructed to identify opinion leader in each subgroup. Finally, consensus reaching models based on two-stage heterogeneous noncooperative behavior are proposed. Noncooperative degree is introduced to measure noncooperative behavior of experts or subgroups. Different feedback mechanisms and noncooperative behavior management methods are applied to both the intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus reaching stages. Finally, the feasibility of this method is verified by a case study of remanufacturer quality assessment and comparative analysis with some state-of-the-art methods.},

Based on the given $L_{\infty }$ performance and finite-frequency $H_{-}$ indexes, the observer is established to construct the residuals that are robust against disturbances and sensitive to actuator faults simultaneously. Under the assumption that disturbances are unknown but bounded, according to the set-membership techniques, all fault detection thresholds generated by fault-free residuals are propagated in a sequence of zonotopes. Moreover, compared with existing unknown input observers, the designed observer overcomes the issue of incomplete decoupling between residuals and unknown disturbances, thereby reducing the conservatism in fault detection. Further, by introducing arbitrary matrices and relaxation matrices, the originally non-convex observer design conditions are transformed into a minimization optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities. The trade-off between robustness to disturbances and sensitivity to faults can be achieved by the iterative solution algorithm, contributing to less conservatism and satisfactory fault detection performance. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection strategy is validated by simulations based on a truck-trailer dynamic model.},

A novel causal evaluation metric, named fuzzy bi-directional causality recognition or fuzzy bicausality recognition (FBR), has been proposed to measure a more comprehensive causal relationship combining with fuzzy theory. FBR constructs a causality estimation model from both sufficient and necessary perspectives, and introduces fuzzy theory to handle the uncertainty in the process of feature discretization. Building on this foundation, decision trees and RFs are established with FBR to form the FBRF while conducting complexity analysis simultaneously. In terms of experiments, results from twenty public datasets of different sizes show that FBRF simplifies the model scale while maintaining comparable precision compared to other RF variants. Therefore, it is demonstrated that FBRF reaches a trade-off between superior interpretability and high performance.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed.

  abstract     = {The (type-1) fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control design offers a viable solution to address nonlinear control challenges in a systematic way. Recently, interval type-2 (IT2) FMB control has drawn attention from researchers due to its superior capability of handling uncertainty which inevitably appears in real-world systems. This review paper gives an overview of the development of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 (T-S and polynomial) FMB control systems delivered in the following topics: overview, IT2 fuzzy models, IT2 fuzzy controllers, stability analysis of IT2 FMB control systems, as well as potential research topics. This review will start by giving an overview of type-1/type-2 model-free and type-1 FMB control methods and their shortcomings which can be overcome by using the IT2 FMB control design. We will identify the difficulties in analysing the stability in terms of modeling concerns, controller issues and analysis tools. In terms of fuzzy modeling, we will recall the preliminary concept and techniques for the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model. In terms of fuzzy controlling, we define the IT2 state-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. In addition, from an implementation perspective, an IT2 fuzzy controller must be well defined, i.e., uncertainty-free, which reduces it to a type-1 fuzzy controller. Then, a summary of stability analysis techniques and results will be discussed. This paper explores the role of the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept and membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis techniques in contributing to the stability analysis. We will then discuss some potential topics related to IT2 FMB control systems. This review paper summarises the recent development and findings of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 FMB control systems, contributions, perspectives, concepts and ideas from the authors. It serves the purposes to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic; to develop insight into the topic by justifying the need for IT2 FMB control and underpinning concepts; to shed light on stability analysis realized by the IPM concept and MFD analysis techniques; to promote the research by proposing variants of models and controllers, and potential research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the survival time of cancer patients is of significant clinical importance for oncologists in evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. In recent years, integrating multimodal data (such as pathological images and genomic data) has played a key role in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of personalized cancer treatment, as well as improving survival prediction performance. However, these studies still face several challenges: they often overlook the fuzzy uncertainties in cross-modal interactions and the high computational complexity of pathological images. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cancer survival prediction framework based on Multimodal Multi-instance Fuzzy Optimal Transport, called M2FOT. This framework aims to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures and effectively integrate complex interactions among different modalities. Specifically, we first employ a fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster patches extracted from all Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the same patient into different phenotypes, thereby reducing computational complexity. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Alternating Encoding (HAE) paradigm for alternating encoding of intramodal and cross-modal feature representations. Simultaneously, to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures, we design a Fuzzy Optimal Transport-based Bilateral CrossAttention (FOTBCA) module. This module introduces fuzzy membership into the global optimal matching, modeling the fuzzy interactions between histology and genomics, thereby facilitating the transmission of complementary multimodal information. Subsequently, we perform multimodal feature fusion to obtain the final survival prediction. Finally, experiments conducted on five cancer datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in cancer survival prediction.},

  abstract     = {Group Emotion Recognition (GER) aims to estimate the collective affect displayed by multiple people in a shared scene. Hard-label voting and static fusion strategies used in prior work often overlook the intrinsic ambiguity of individual emotions and the non-linear group-level interactions, including conflict, tendency and resonance. We present Fuzzy Emotional Hierarchical Shared Space (FEHSS), a three-subspace framework that assigns each person a soft membership vector across emotion categories, simultaneously optimises conflict suppression, tendency regulation and resonance enhancement, and updates its fusion rules on the fly through a hierarchical reinforcement optimiser (HIRO). Comprehensive evaluations on GroupEmoW, GAD 2.0, and EMOTIC-7 confirm that FEHSS sets a new state of the art, reaching 91.77% accuracy on GroupEmoW and consistently outperforming previous methods on the other two benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the three subspaces and the necessity of dynamic parameter tuning. Qualitative visualisations further illustrate how FEHSS resolves contradictory cues and preserves subtle shared emotions that rigid fusion schemes overlook. Additional experiments on the EMOTIC-7 dataset with seven emotion classes show that FEHSS attains 74.3% top-1 accuracy and 71.8% macro-F1. The proposed framework thus offers both higher accuracy and stronger interpretability, providing a new pathway toward robust GER in unconstrained real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Microwave filters (MFs) are indispensable in communication systems for selecting specific frequency signals. The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

  abstract     = {Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system has been successfully applied to various practical problems due to its good performance and interpretability. One important prerequisite for the interpretability of a fuzzy system is a concise rule base. However, how to construct a concise TSK fuzzy system more transparently and adaptively from data remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework of constructing concise instance-based TSK fuzzy systems using a novel multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with a bimutation strategy (MOPSO-BM). In the first phase, a basic fuzzy system is constructed, where the rule antecedents are initialized based on some representative input instances selected by a sample filtering algorithm, and the consequent parameters are obtained by least squares estimation. Then in the second phase, the proposed MOPSO-BM algorithm is utilized to further reduce the number of fuzzy rules and fine-tune the consequent parameters, resulting in a set of fuzzy systems that achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model based on their specific requirements, or simply via cross validation. Numerical experiments on twelve benchmark datasets have substantiated the superior performance of the proposed framework in designing high-precision and compact TSK fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking in bimanual humanoid robots, whose closed-chain kinematic structures inherently amplify the effects of modeling errors, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters, is a challenging task. To address this, we reformulate the dual-arm tracking task as a servo constraint-following problem and derive the system dynamics under approximate constraints using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. The humanoid system is modeled as a constrained mechanical structure subjected to fast-varying, bounded uncertainties with unknown limits. On this basis, we propose a robust control framework that guarantees both uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error, ensuring stability and performance even under severe parametric and dynamic uncertainties. To reconcile the trade-off between transient dynamics and steady-state accuracy—essential for service-oriented tasks such as door opening or coffee pouring—we integrate a Nash equilibrium-based optimization mechanism into the controller design. By formulating a two-player non-cooperative game over the controller's key tuning parameters, we analytically derive the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solutions of the game, achieving an optimal balance between competing objectives. Comprehensive simulations on a reduced-order bimanual humanoid model validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection, and energy efficiency compared to benchmark methods. The proposed strategy offers a theoretically grounded and practically implementable solution for robust, constraint-compliant humanoid manipulation.},

Second, considering the stochastic actuator failures caused by Markov jump, an ISDF control strategy is developed for the nonlinear coupled ODE-PDE system under spatially LAMs, which only demands a minimal number of sensors and actuators. Then, through constructing a time-dependent switched Lyapunov functional, the stochastically exponential stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and ISDF control gains are obtained by solving these LMIs.

However, ocean current disturbance and color distortion pose significant challenges in achieving reliable 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes. This paper investigates 3D reconstruction based on movable stereo camera via an underwater teleoperator. Specifically, a vision system based on ORB-SLAM3 is constructed to calculate the depth maps and perform dense 3D reconstruction through real-time video frames. An improved Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration-Color Correction (MSRCR-CC) algorithm is proposed to address color distortion in underwater image enhancement. A redundant point removal algorithm is designed for the point cloud mapping process, effectively reducing the system's computational burden. Furthermore, to ensure stable scanning and obtain a high-quality original video stream in disturbed underwater environments, a disturbance observer-based prescribed performance control scheme is proposed for the underwater teleoperation system. The proposed control strategy guarantees that the master- slave synchronization error is bounded within predefined boundaries, which can enhance the fast fourier transform response value of the original image, and thus improve the 3D reconstruction quality. A global prescribed performance function is applied, which removes the initial value restriction on synchronization errors. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In rehabilitation applications, encouraging patients to actively participate in training is essential for effective recovery. However, personalized control design in robot-assisted therapy remains challenging due to variations in patients' motor capabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control framework that integrates a hybrid fuzzy-transformer neural network (HFTN) with a fuzzy echo state network (FESN)-based variable impedance controller to ensure personalized support and active engagement. The HFTN integrates fuzzy logic with transformer architectures in parallel paths, establishing a novel neuro-fuzzy musculoskeletal (MSK) model that maps surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to joint torque through combined uncertainty and temporal modeling for enhanced real-time estimation. The variable impedance controller constructs the stiffness and damping matrices of the robotic system through the FESN and develops an adaptive update law for the FESN output weights, effectively addressing instability issues in variable stiffness control. Furthermore, driven by physiologically estimated joint torques from the HFTN, the adaption of the FESN reservoir states enables real-time modulation of stiffness and damping, facilitating transitions between human-dominated and robot-dominated modes. This realizes the AAN concept, ensuring personalized and responsive assistance. Various experiments on an upper limb rehabilitation robot were conducted to validate the effectiveness of both the neuro-fuzzy MSK model and the AAN controller in delivering optimal assistance while promoting active user participation.},
