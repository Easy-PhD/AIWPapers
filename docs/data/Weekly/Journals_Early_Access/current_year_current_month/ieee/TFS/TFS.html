  abstract     = {The ambiguity and incompleteness of electric vehicle (EV) user behavior preferences, as well as the uncertainty of randomly arriving EV charging demands, pose significant challenges for the scheduling of an EV charging station (EVCS). To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) information. The IVIF information excels at capturing the dynamic and ambiguous nature of user preferences. An interpretable quantitative evaluation method based on IVIF is proposed to provide reliable prior knowledge for decision-making. The novel reward functions account for both group and individual characteristics, achieving a balance in their timely responses. In order to solve the problem of mixed-integer second-order cone and semidefinite programming (MI-SOCSDP) with sparse uncertain data, an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) is developed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the consistency between the charging/discharging decision-making processes and users' fuzzy preferences. Moreover, the proposed method minimizes the worst-case expected cost over the ambiguity sets of probability distributions, effectively verifying the robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {Single image dehazing has been extensively studied. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven notable progress in single image dehazing, their performance remains fundamentally constrained by the limited local receptive fields of convolutional operations, which impede the capture of global structural dependencies. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image synthesis, offering global insights into structure, texture, and color. The fuzzy prior, a probabilistic knowledge acquired through adversarial training in GANs, plays a pivotal role in robust dehazing. Motivated by this, we propose the fuzzy prior guided dehazing network (FPGDN). Our framework begins with a novel module that distills the fuzzy prior by translating an edge map into a color image, simultaneously capturing global structural, local textural, and color information. Subsequently, a dehazing network is constructed, leveraging this fuzzy prior. While the fuzzy prior captures rich color and texture features, the generated images may exhibit color shifts relative to the original scene. To remedy this, a CNN network is employed to capture local nuances and refine the dehazing outcome. Extensive experiments substantiate that the proposed FPGDN achieves superior dehazing performance on a variety of real and synthetic hazy images.},
