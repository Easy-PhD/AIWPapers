  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in investigating the interactions of communication and control in networked control systems (NCSs) or multiagent systems (MASs). Although extensive research has been explored on these interactions, most studies are oversimplified and idealized. Therefore, more in-depth and practical studies on communication in control systems are needed. Our study aims to explore the practical impacts of communication networks on control systems. We provide a general overhead analysis for the structure of NCSs and design an express delivery-based cost chart, referred to as an E-Chart, for the control message sizes. We found an effect in the express delivery service known as the “Rice Grain Effect,” defined as the cost of delivering a single rice grain is the same as the cost of delivering two rice grains. We apply the effect to the control overhead analysis and the E-Chart. We present the results of the E-Chart and the overhead under different message sizes and compression ratios; furthermore, we define a new metric to reflect the stability of the formation control and conduct simulations to study the impacts of message size and error on NCSs. In particular, formation control is affected by both bit error rate and message size, and the system exhibits high sensitivity to variations in bit error rate.},

  abstract     = {The variable nature of sustainable energy sources, coupled with unpredictable fluctuations in load, significantly impacts microgrid planning and operation. This creates an urgent need for storage systems that possess both high energy and power handling capacities to enhance the reliability and efficiency of microgrids. Hybridizing fuel cells (FCs) and battery storage system offers a promising solution by combining the advantages of both technologies. To this end, this article introduces an innovative model designed to determine the optimal sizing and management of a hybrid system comprising FCs and lithium batteries for islanded microgrid applications. The model considers the critical tradeoffs between the high-power density and efficiency of lithium batteries and the extended lifespan and energy density of FCs. Furthermore, it incorporates factors such as investment and operational expenses, the state-of-health of the FC, battery degradation costs, and the dynamic efficiency of the FC. To reduce computational burden, all constraints are modeled as linear, and mixed integer linear programming, suitable for linear models, is employed for the problem formulation. Simulation results and comparative analyses confirm the model’s effectiveness, demonstrating a reduction in annual microgrid cost by up to 24.45% while exhibiting a notable 8% reduction in required storage compared to using only individual lithium battery storage.},
