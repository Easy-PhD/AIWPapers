  abstract     = {In this article, we present our work to proactively mitigate distributed denial-of-service attacks in 5G core network slicing using slice isolation. Network slicing is one of the key technologies that allow 5G networks to offer dedicated resources to different industries (services). However, a distributed denial-of-service attack could severely impact the performance and availability of the slices as they could share the same physical resources in a multitenant virtualized networking infrastructure. Slice isolation is an essential requirement for 5G network slicing. In this article, we use slice isolation to tackle the challenging problem of distributed denial-of-service attacks in 5G network slicing. We utilize a mathematical model that can provide on-demand inter and intraslice isolation for 5G core network slices. We evaluate this work with a mix of simulation and experimental work as well as performance evaluation of the mathematical model. Our results show that slice isolation could mitigate distributed denial-of-service attacks as well as increase the availability of the slices. We believe this work will encourage further research in securing 5G network slicing.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities and their associated applications integrate various cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and edge computing (EC). ML-driven services within smart cities are often computationally intensive and time-sensitive. While EC serves as a complementary infrastructure to traditional cloud-end users architecture, enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) for end users, the advent of ML-dependent services necessitates a redefinition of QoS to incorporate relevant ML performance metrics. On the other side, the limited computational capabilities of EC servers make such QoS metrics conflicting. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between system cost for running ML models and ML model performance. In this article, we present an effective offloading scheme designed for a three-layer cloud–edge–users system, aiming to optimize the performance-QoS tradeoff in the long run, especially for ML-dependent services, considering the dynamic of the system. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques, we transform the offloading problem from a long-term perspective into a frame-based problem. Recognizing that the new per-frame problem is NP-hard, we introduce a tabu search-based algorithm, termed TSMALE, to address this challenge. Analytically, we demonstrate that our proposed TSMALE algorithm achieves an approximate solution of roughly 0.923 compared to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the dynamic event-triggered consensus of linear leader-following multiagent systems under matrix-weighted networks. In such networks, matrix weights characterize the dependencies among multidimensional states of agents. First, we propose a distributed dynamic event-triggered control protocol in which each agent employs an auxiliary system to dynamically adjust the triggering threshold. Moreover, it is ensured that the sequence of triggering times does not exhibit Zeno behavior under given conditions. Remarkably, clustering naturally occurs in matrix-weighted networks, which reflects the important role of matrix coupling in the convergence process. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is applied to achieve leader-following consensus in matrix-weighted multiagent networks. Finally, a simulation is presented to verify the reliability of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the event-triggered distributed model predictive control (ET-DMPC) strategy for the load frequency control (LFC) issue of multiarea interconnected power systems (IPSs) subject to bounded disturbances and load reference set-point constraints. The entire IPS comprises multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each exchanging information with interconnected subsystems through the communication network. Local DMPC controllers are designed with robust constraints and load reference set-point constraints, where robust constraints limit the impact of tie-line power deviations and disturbances. To further alleviate the computational and communication burdens of subsystems, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed, in which the threshold integrates the information of current subsystem state, disturbances, and tie-line power deviations between areas. By comparing this threshold with the deviation between the actual trajectory and the optimal prediction, the instants of optimization problem solving and information transmission are determined, effectively balancing control performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the theoretical conditions guaranteeing Zeno-free behavior, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation results and analysis for a three-area IPS demonstrate that computational and communication burdens are significantly reduced while achieving a satisfactory LFC objective, which validates the effectiveness of the ET-DMPC strategy.},

  abstract     = {In competitive wargames, human players leverage visual attention mechanisms to rapidly identify mission-critical information and make real-time decisions. However, conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often lack this ability to focus on critical cues, limiting their efficiency and decision quality. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that enhances agent decision-making by incorporating human visual attention (HVA) into DRL through two key innovations. First, we develop an improved convolutional neural network for visual attention prediction, which outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. Second, we propose HVA proximal policy optimization (PPO), a novel DRL framework that integrates HVA through two mechanisms: 1) attention-guided sampling; and 2) multimodal feature fusion for comprehensive state representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an 84.4% winning rate (15.6% higher than standard PPO) with significantly faster convergence. Ablation studies further confirm that both the attention prediction model and its integration mechanism contribute substantially to performance gains. These findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating human cognitive patterns into agent learning, offering new insights for human-agent hybrid strategies in dynamic tasks.},
